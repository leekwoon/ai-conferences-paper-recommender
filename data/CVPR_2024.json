{"title": "Exploring the Potential of Large Foundation Models for Open-Vocabulary HOI Detection", "authors": "Ting Lei, Shaofeng Yin, Yang Liu", "abstract": "Open-vocabulary human-object interaction (HOI) detection which is concerned with the problem of detecting novel HOIs guided by natural language is crucial for understanding human-centric scenes. However prior zero-shot HOI detectors often employ the same levels of feature maps to model HOIs with varying distances leading to suboptimal performance in scenes containing human-object pairs with a wide range of distances. In addition these detectors primarily rely on category names and overlook the rich contextual information that language can provide which is essential for capturing open vocabulary concepts that are typically rare and not well-represented by category names alone. In this paper we introduce a novel end-to-end open vocabulary HOI detection framework with conditional multi-level decoding and fine-grained semantic enhancement (CMD-SE) harnessing the potential of Visual-Language Models (VLMs). Specifically we propose to model human-object pairs with different distances with different levels of feature maps by incorporating a soft constraint during the bipartite matching process. Furthermore by leveraging large language models (LLMs) such as GPT models we exploit their extensive world knowledge to generate descriptions of human body part states for various interactions. Then we integrate the generalizable and fine-grained semantics of human body parts to improve interaction recognition. Experimental results on two datasets SWIG-HOI and HICO-DET demonstrate that our proposed method achieves state-of-the-art results in open vocabulary HOI detection.

{"title": "Enhancing Intrinsic Features for Debiasing via Investigating Class-Discerning Common Attributes in Bias-Contrastive Pair", "authors": "Jeonghoon Park, Chaeyeon Chung, Jaegul Choo", "abstract": "In the image classification task deep neural networks frequently rely on bias attributes that are spuriously correlated with a target class in the presence of dataset bias resulting in degraded performance when applied to data without bias attributes. The task of debiasing aims to compel classifiers to learn intrinsic attributes that inherently define a target class rather than focusing on bias attributes. While recent approaches mainly focus on emphasizing the learning of data samples without bias attributes (i.e. bias-conflicting samples) compared to samples with bias attributes (i.e. bias-aligned samples) they fall short of directly guiding models where to focus for learning intrinsic features. To address this limitation this paper proposes a method that provides the model with explicit spatial guidance that indicates the region of intrinsic features. We first identify the intrinsic features by investigating the class-discerning common features between a bias-aligned (BA) sample and a bias-conflicting (BC) sample (i.e. bias-contrastive pair). Next we enhance the intrinsic features in the BA sample that are relatively under-exploited for prediction compared to the BC sample. To construct the bias-contrastive pair without using bias information we introduce a bias-negative score that distinguishes BC samples from BA samples employing a biased model. The experiments demonstrate that our method achieves state-of-the-art performance on synthetic and real-world datasets with various levels of bias severity."},
{"title": "SPIN: Simultaneous Perception Interaction and Navigation", "authors": "Shagun Uppal, Ananye Agarwal, Haoyu Xiong, Kenneth Shaw, Deepak Pathak", "abstract": "While there has been remarkable progress recently in the fields of manipulation and locomotion mobile manipulation remains a long-standing challenge. Compared to locomotion or static manipulation a mobile system must make a diverse range of long-horizon tasks feasible in unstructured and dynamic environments. While the applications are broad and interesting there are a plethora of challenges in developing these systems such as coordination between the base and arm reliance on onboard perception for perceiving and interacting with the environment and most importantly simultaneously integrating all these parts together. Prior works approach the problem using disentangled modular skills for mobility and manipulation that are trivially tied together. This causes several limitations such as compounding errors delays in decision-making and no whole-body coordination. In this work we present a reactive mobile manipulation framework that uses an active visual system to consciously perceive and react to its environment. Similar to how humans leverage whole-body and hand-eye coordination we develop a mobile manipulator that exploits its ability to move and see more specifically -- to move in order to see and to see in order to move. This allows it to not only move around and interact with its environment but also choose \"when\" to perceive \"what\" using an active visual system. We observe that such an agent learns to navigate around complex cluttered scenarios while displaying agile whole-body coordination using only ego-vision without needing to create environment maps.

Unlike existing methods which require a large number of training resources or learn motions that are precisely aligned with template videos it achieves a trade-off between the degree of generation freedom and the resource costs for model training. Specifically we design a motion-content decoupled pipeline that uses an off-the-shelf text-to-image model for content generation so that our tuned video diffusion model mainly focuses on motion learning. The well-developed text-to-image techniques can provide visually pleasing and diverse content as generation conditions which highly improves video quality and generation freedom. To capture the features of temporal dimension we expand the pre-trained 2D convolution layers of the T2I model to our novel temporal-spatial motion learning layers and modify the attention blocks to the temporal level. Additionally we develop an effective inference trick shared-noise sampling which can improve the stability of videos without computational costs. Our method can also be flexibly applied to other tasks e.g. real-world image animation and video editing. Extensive experiments demonstrate that LAMP can effectively learn the motion pattern on limited data and generate high-quality videos.

DREAM features two components: diffusion rectification which adjusts training to reflect the sampling process and estimation adaptation which balances perception against distortion. When applied to image super-resolution (SR) DREAM adeptly navigates the tradeoff between minimizing distortion and preserving high image quality. Experiments demonstrate DREAM's superiority over standard diffusion-based SR methods showing a to faster training convergence and a to reduction in necessary sampling steps to achieve comparable or superior results.

{"title": "Compositional Chain-of-Thought Prompting for Large Multimodal Models", "authors": "Chancharik Mitra, Brandon Huang, Trevor Darrell, Roei Herzig", "abstract": "The combination of strong visual backbones and Large Language Model (LLM) reasoning has led to Large Multimodal Models (LMMs) becoming the current standard for a wide range of vision and language (VL) tasks. However recent research has shown that even the most advanced LMMs still struggle to capture aspects of compositional visual reasoning such as attributes and relationships between objects. One solution is to utilize scene graphs (SGs)---a formalization of objects and their relations and attributes that has been extensively used as a bridge between the visual and textual domains. Yet scene graph data requires scene graph annotations which are expensive to collect and thus not easily scalable. Moreover finetuning an LMM based on SG data can lead to catastrophic forgetting of the pretraining objective. To overcome this inspired by chain-of-thought methods we propose Compositional Chain-of-Thought (CCoT) a novel zero-shot Chain-of-Thought prompting method that utilizes SG representations in order to extract compositional knowledge from an LMM. Specifically we first generate an SG using the LMM and then use that SG in the prompt to produce a response. Through extensive experiments we find that the proposed CCoT approach not only improves LMM performance on several vision and language VL compositional benchmarks but also improves the performance of several popular LMMs on general multimodal benchmarks without the need for fine-tuning or annotated ground-truth SGs.

{"title": "Diffusion Time-step Curriculum for One Image to 3D Generation", "authors": "Xuanyu Yi, Zike Wu, Qingshan Xu, Pan Zhou, Joo-Hwee Lim, Hanwang Zhang", "abstract": "Score distillation sampling (SDS) has been widely adopted to overcome the absence of unseen views in reconstructing 3D objects from a single image. It leverages pre-trained 2D diffusion models as teacher to guide the reconstruction of student 3D models. Despite their remarkable success SDS-based methods often encounter geometric artifacts and texture saturation. We find out the crux is the overlooked indiscriminate treatment of diffusion time-steps during optimization: it unreasonably treats the student-teacher knowledge distillation to be equal at all time-steps and thus entangles coarse-grained and fine-grained modeling. Therefore we propose the Diffusion Time-step Curriculum one-image-to-3D pipeline (DTC123) which involves both the teacher and student models collaborating with the time-step curriculum in a coarse-to-fine manner. Extensive experiments on NeRF4 RealFusion15 GSO and Level50 benchmark demonstrate that DTC123 can produce multi-view consistent high-quality and diverse 3D assets.

This problem is further exacerbated when clients' data vary in modalities. In response to these issues of statistical heterogeneity and modality incompatibility we propose the Adaptive Hyper-graph Aggregation framework a novel solution for Modality-Agnostic Federated Learning. We design a Modular Architecture for Local Model with single modality setting the stage for efficient intra-modality sharing and inter-modality complementarity. An innovative Global Consensus Prototype Enhancer is crafted to assimilate and broadcast global consensus knowledge within the network. At the core of our approach lies the Adaptive Hyper-graph Learning Strategy which effectively tackles the inherent challenges of modality incompatibility and statistical heterogeneity within federated learning environments accomplishing this adaptively even without the server being aware of the clients' modalities. Our approach tested on three multimodal benchmark datasets demonstrated strong performance across diverse data distributions affirming its effectiveness in multimodal federated learning."},

However current NeRF-based methods are limited in the capabilities of adding or removing objects. This paper fills the aforementioned gap by proposing a new language-driven method for object manipulation in NeRFs through dataset updates. Specifically to insert an object represented by a set of multi-view images into a background NeRF we use a text-to-image diffusion model to blend the object into the given background across views. The generated images are then used to update the NeRF so that we can render view-consistent images of the object within the background. To ensure view consistency we propose a dataset update strategy that prioritizes the radiance field training based on camera poses in a pose-ordered manner. We validate our method in two case studies: object insertion and object removal. Experimental results show that our method can generate photo-realistic results and achieves state-of-the-art performance in NeRF editing."},
{"title": "Vanishing-Point-Guided Video Semantic Segmentation of Driving Scenes", "authors": "Diandian Guo, Deng-Ping Fan, Tongyu Lu, Christos Sakaridis, Luc Van Gool", "abstract": "The estimation of implicit cross-frame correspondences and the high computational cost have long been major challenges in video semantic segmentation (VSS) for driving scenes. Prior works utilize keyframes feature propagation or cross-frame attention to address these issues. By contrast we are the first to harness vanishing point (VP) priors for more effective segmentation. Intuitively objects near VPs (i.e. away from the vehicle) are less discernible. Moreover they tend to move radially away from the VP over time in the usual case of a forward-facing camera a straight road and linear forward motion of the vehicle. Our novel efficient network for VSS named VPSeg incorporates two modules that utilize exactly this pair of static and dynamic VP priors: sparse-to-dense feature mining (DenseVP) and VP-guided motion fusion (MotionVP). MotionVP employs VP-guided motion estimation to establish explicit correspondences across frames and help attend to the most relevant features from neighboring frames while DenseVP enhances weak dynamic features in distant regions around VPs. These modules operate within a context-detail framework which separates contextual features from high-resolution local features at different input resolutions to reduce computational costs. Contextual and local features are integrated through contextualized motion attention (CMA) for the final prediction. Extensive experiments on two popular driving segmentation benchmarks Cityscapes and ACDC demonstrate that VPSeg outperforms previous SOTA methods with only modest computational overhead."},
{"title": "IS-Fusion: Instance-Scene Collaborative Fusion for Multimodal 3D Object Detection", "authors": "Junbo Yin, Jianbing Shen, Runnan Chen, Wei Li, Ruigang Yang, Pascal Frossard, Wenguan Wang", "abstract": "Bird's eye view (BEV) representation has emerged as a dominant solution for describing 3D space in autonomous driving scenarios. However objects in the BEV representation typically exhibit small sizes and the associated point cloud context is inherently sparse which leads to great challenges for reliable 3D perception. In this paper we propose IS-Fusion an innovative multimodal fusion framework that jointly captures the Instance- and Scene-level contextual information. IS-Fusion essentially differs from existing approaches that only focus on the BEV scene-level fusion by explicitly incorporating instance-level multimodal information thus facilitating the instance-centric tasks like 3D object detection. It comprises a Hierarchical Scene Fusion (HSF) module and an Instance-Guided Fusion (IGF) module. HSF applies Point-to-Grid and Grid-to-Region transformers to capture the multimodal scene context at different granularities. IGF mines instance candidates explores their relationships and aggregates the local multimodal context for each instance. These instances then serve as guidance to enhance the scene feature and yield an instance-aware BEV representation. On the challenging nuScenes benchmark IS-Fusion outperforms all the published multimodal works to date."},

However existing RefSR methods are limited by the faithfulness of content reconstruction and the effectiveness of texture transfer in large scaling factors. Conditional diffusion models have opened up new opportunities for generating realistic high-resolution images but effectively utilizing reference images within these models remains an area for further exploration. Furthermore content fidelity is difficult to guarantee in areas without relevant reference information. To solve these issues we propose a change-aware diffusion model named Ref-Diff for RefSR using the land cover change priors to guide the denoising process explicitly. Specifically we inject the priors into the denoising model to improve the utilization of reference information in unchanged areas and regulate the reconstruction of semantically relevant content in changed areas. With this powerful guidance we decouple the semantics-guided denoising and reference texture-guided denoising processes to improve the model performance. Extensive experiments demonstrate the superior effectiveness and robustness of the proposed method compared with state-of-the-art RefSR methods in both quantitative and qualitative evaluations.

However existing ZSL methods simply extract visual features using a pre-trained network backbone (i.e. CNN or ViT) which fail to learn matched visual-semantic correspondences for representing semantic-related visual features as lacking of the guidance of semantic information resulting in undesirable visual-semantic interactions. To tackle this issue we propose a progressive semantic-guided vision transformer for zero-shot learning (dubbed ZSLViT). ZSLViT mainly considers two properties in the whole network: i) discover the semantic-related visual representations explicitly and ii) discard the semantic-unrelated visual information. Specifically we first introduce semantic-embedded token learning to improve the visual-semantic correspondences via semantic enhancement and discover the semantic-related visual tokens explicitly with semantic-guided token attention. Then we fuse low semantic-visual correspondence visual tokens to discard the semantic-unrelated visual information for visual enhancement. These two operations are integrated into various encoders to progressively learn semantic-related visual representations for accurate visual-semantic interactions in ZSL. The extensive experiments show that our ZSLViT achieves significant performance gains on three popular benchmark datasets i.e. CUB SUN and AWA2."},

The challenge is to effectively remove objects while inpainting perceptually consistent content for the missing regions which is particularly demanding for existing NeRF models due to their implicit volumetric representation. Moreover unbounded scenes are more prone to floater artifacts in the inpainted region than frontal-facing scenes as the change of object appearance and background across views is more sensitive to inaccurate segmentations and inconsistent inpainting. With a trained NeRF and a text description our method efficiently removes specified objects and inpaints visually consistent content without artifacts. We apply depth-space warping to enforce consistency across multiview text-encoded segmentations and then refine the inpainted NeRF model using perceptual priors and 3D diffusion-based geometric priors to ensure visual plausibility. Through extensive experiments in segmentation and inpainting on 360-degree and frontal-facing NeRFs we show that InNeRF360 is effective and enhances NeRF's editability.

We focus on this framework and propose a new pruning at initialization algorithm that leverages the Neural Tangent Kernel (NTK) theory to align the training dynamics of the sparse network with that of the dense one. Specifically we show how the usually neglected data-dependent component in the NTK's spectrum can be taken into account by providing an analytical upper bound to the NTK's trace obtained by decomposing neural networks into individual paths. This leads to our Path eXclusion (PX) a foresight pruning method designed to preserve the parameters that mostly influence the NTK's trace. PX is able to find lottery tickets (i.e. good paths) even at high sparsity levels and largely reduces the need for additional training. When applied to pre-trained models it extracts subnetworks directly usable for several downstream tasks resulting in performance comparable to those of the dense counterpart but with substantial cost and computational savings."},

Despite encouraging results existing approaches rarely consider the effects of the external scene on the motion sequence leading to pronounced artifacts and physical implausibilities in the predictions. To address this limitation this work introduces a novel multi-modal sense-informed motion prediction approach which conditions high-fidelity generation on two modal information: external 3D scene and internal human gaze and is able to recognize their salience for future human activity. Furthermore the gaze information is regarded as the human intention and combined with both motion and scene features we construct a ternary intention-aware attention to supervise the generation to match where the human wants to reach. Meanwhile we introduce semantic coherence-aware attention to explicitly distinguish the salient point clouds and the underlying ones to ensure a reasonable interaction of the generated sequence with the 3D scene. On two real-world benchmarks the proposed method achieves state-of-the-art performance both in 3D human pose and trajectory prediction.

CL is vulnerable to data poisoning based backdoor attacks (DPBAs) in which an attacker injects poisoned inputs into the pre-training dataset so the encoder is backdoored. However existing DPBAs achieve limited effectiveness. In this work we take the first step to analyze the limitations of existing backdoor attacks and propose new DPBAs called CorruptEncoder to CL. CorruptEncoder introduces a new attack strategy to create poisoned inputs and uses a theory-guided method to maximize attack effectiveness. Our experiments show that CorruptEncoder substantially outperforms existing DPBAs. In particular CorruptEncoder is the first DPBA that achieves more than 90% attack success rates with only a few (3) reference images and a small poisoning ratio (0.5%). Moreover we also propose a defense called localized cropping to defend against DPBAs. Our results show that our defense can reduce the effectiveness of DPBAs but it sacrifices the utility of the encoder highlighting the need for new defenses."},

Considering text prompts not all random noises are effective in synthesizing semantically-faithful images. We design the cross-attention response score and the self-attention conflict score to evaluate the initial noise bifurcating the initial latent space into valid and invalid sectors.

However there still exist critical problems blocking the practicality of NVC. In this paper we propose a powerful conditional coding-based NVC that solves two critical problems via feature modulation. The first is how to support a wide quality range in a single model. Previous NVC with this capability only supports about 3.8 dB PSNR range on average. To tackle this limitation we modulate the latent feature of the current frame via the learnable quantization scaler. During the training we specially design the uniform quantization parameter sampling mechanism to improve the harmonization of encoding and quantization. This results in a better learning of the quantization scaler and helps our NVC support about 11.4 dB PSNR range. The second is how to make NVC still work under a long prediction chain. We expose that the previous SOTA NVC has an obvious quality degradation problem when using a large intra-period setting. To this end we propose modulating the temporal feature with a periodically refreshing mechanism to boost the quality. Notably under single intra-frame setting our codec can achieve 29.7% bitrate saving over previous SOTA NVC with 16% MACs reduction. Our codec serves as a notable landmark in the journey of NVC evolution. The codes are at https://github.com/microsoft/DCVC."},

The gap in performance between methods that consume posed images versus post-processed 3D point clouds has fueled the belief that 2D and 3D perception require distinct model architectures. In this paper we challenge this view and propose ODIN (Omni-Dimensional INstance segmentation) a model that can segment and label both 2D RGB images and 3D point clouds using a transformer architecture that alternates between 2D within-view and 3D cross-view information fusion. Our model differentiates 2D and 3D feature operations through the positional encodings of the tokens involved which capture pixel coordinates for 2D patch tokens and 3D coordinates for 3D feature tokens. ODIN achieves state-of-the-art performance on ScanNet200 Matterport3D and AI2THOR 3D instance segmentation benchmarks and competitive performance on ScanNet S3DIS and COCO. It outperforms all previous works by a wide margin when the sensed 3D point cloud is used in place of the point cloud sampled from 3D mesh.

While most existing debiasing methods require full supervision on either spurious attributes or target labels training a debiased model from a limited amount of both annotations is still an open question. To address this issue we investigate an interesting phenomenon using the spectral analysis of latent representations: spuriously correlated attributes make neural networks inductively biased towards encoding lower effective rank representations. We also show that a rank regularization can amplify this bias in a way that encourages highly correlated features. Leveraging these findings we propose a self-supervised debiasing framework potentially compatible with unlabeled samples. Specifically we first pretrain a biased encoder in a self-supervised manner with the rank regularization serving as a semantic bottleneck to enforce the encoder to learn the spuriously correlated attributes. This biased encoder is then used to discover and upweight bias-conflicting samples in a downstream task serving as a boosting to effectively debias the main model. Remarkably the proposed debiasing framework significantly improves the generalization performance of self-supervised learning baselines and in some cases even outperforms state-of-the-art supervised debiasing approaches."},

However these methods mainly focus on the design of complex model structures to extract discriminative features leaving the loss functions for IRSTD under-explored. For example the widely used Intersection over Union (IoU) and Dice losses lack sensitivity to the scales and locations of targets limiting the detection performance of detectors. In this paper we focus on boosting detection performance with a more effective loss but a simpler model structure. Specifically we first propose a novel Scale and Location Sensitive (SLS) loss to handle the limitations of existing losses: 1) for scale sensitivity we compute a weight for the IoU loss based on target scales to help the detector distinguish targets with different scales: 2) for location sensitivity we introduce a penalty term based on the center points of targets to help the detector localize targets more precisely. Then we design a simple Multi-Scale Head to the plain U-Net (MSHNet). By applying SLS loss to each scale of the predictions our MSHNet outperforms existing state-of-the-art methods by a large margin. In addition the detection performance of existing detectors can be further improved when trained with our SLS loss demonstrating the effectiveness and generalization of our SLS loss.

This kind of attack is ubiquitous for various applications and we use object detection to demonstrate how such kind of attacks work. We also design a framework named Overload to generate latency attacks at scale. Our method is based on a newly formulated optimization problem and a novel technique called spatial attention. This attack serves to escalate the required computing costs during the inference time consequently leading to an extended inference time for object detection. It presents a significant threat especially to systems with limited computing resources. We conducted experiments using YOLOv5 models on Nvidia NX. Compared to existing methods our method is simpler and more effective. The experimental results show that with latency attacks the inference time of a single image can be increased ten times longer in reference to the normal setting. Moreover our findings pose a potential new threat to all object detection tasks requiring non-maximum suppression (NMS) as our attack is NMS-agnostic."},

Lau, Wangmeng Zuo", "abstract": "3D generation has raised great attention in recent years. With the success of text-to-image diffusion models the 2D-lifting technique becomes a promising route to controllable 3D generation. However these methods tend to present inconsistent geometry which is also known as the Janus problem. We observe that the problem is caused mainly by two aspects i.e. viewpoint bias in 2D diffusion models and overfitting of the optimization objective. To address it we propose a two-stage 2D-lifting framework namely DreamControl which optimizes coarse NeRF scenes as 3D self-prior and then generates fine-grained objects with control-based score distillation. Specifically adaptive viewpoint sampling and boundary integrity metric are proposed to ensure the consistency of generated priors. The priors are then regarded as input conditions to maintain reasonable geometries in which conditional LoRA and weighted score are further proposed to optimize detailed textures. DreamControl can generate high-quality 3D content in terms of both geometry consistency and texture fidelity. Moreover our control-based optimization guidance is applicable to more downstream tasks including user-guided generation and 3D animation."},

Chan, Qiang Qiu", "abstract": "The astonishing development of single-photon cameras has created an unprecedented opportunity for scientific and industrial imaging. However the high data throughput generated by these 1-bit sensors creates a significant bottleneck for low-power applications. In this paper we explore the possibility of generating a color image from a single binary frame of a single-photon camera. We evidently find this problem being particularly difficult to standard colorization approaches due to the substantial degree of exposure variation. The core innovation of our paper is an exposure synthesis model framed under a neural ordinary differential equation (Neural ODE) that allows us to generate a continuum of exposures from a single observation. This innovation ensures consistent exposure in binary images that colorizers take on resulting in notably enhanced colorization. We demonstrate applications of the method in single-image and burst colorization and show superior generative performance over baselines.

Specifically the network goes through Rep expansion restoration and backpropagation operations during training and iterating through these processes in each annealing round. Such a method exhibits good generalization and is easy to apply and we provide theoretical explanations for its effectiveness.

To this end we introduce Neural Riemannian Distance Fields (NRDFs) data-driven priors modeling the space of plausible articulations represented as the zero-level-set of a neural field in a high-dimensional product-quaternion space. To train NRDFs only on positive examples we introduce a new sampling algorithm ensuring that the geodesic distances follow a desired distribution yielding a principled distance field learning paradigm. We then devise a projection algorithm to map any random pose onto the level-set by an adaptive-step Riemannian optimizer adhering to the product manifold of joint rotations at all times. NRDFs can compute the Riemannian gradient via backpropagation and by mathematical analogy are related to Riemannian flow matching a recent generative model. We conduct a comprehensive evaluation of NRDF against other pose priors in various downstream tasks i.e. pose generation image-based pose estimation and solving inverse kinematics highlighting NRDF's superior performance. Besides humans NRDF's versatility extends to hand and animal poses as it can effectively represent any articulation."},

While there exist large text corpora and image-text pairs high-quality video-text data is much harder to collect. First of all manual labeling is more time-consuming as it requires an annotator to watch an entire video. Second videos have a temporal dimension consist of a number of scenes stacked together and show multiple actions. Accordingly to establish a video dataset with high-quality captions we propose an automatic approach leveraging multimodal inputs such as textual video description subtitles and individual video frames. Specifically we curate 3.8M high-resolution videos from the publicly available HD-VILA-100M dataset. We then split them into semantically consistent video clips and apply multiple cross-modality teacher models to obtain captions for each video. Next we finetune a retrieval model on a small subset where the best caption of each video is manually selected and then employ the model in the whole dataset to select the best caption as the annotation. In this way we get 70M videos paired with high-quality text captions. We dub the dataset as Panda-70M. We show the value of the proposed dataset on three downstream tasks: video captioning video and text retrieval and text-driven video generation. The models trained on the proposed data score substantially better on the majority of metrics across all the tasks."},

For image classification this manifests in the existence of adversarial attacks the performance drops on distorted images and a lack of generalization to concepts such as sketches. The current understanding of generalization in neural networks is very limited but some biases that differentiate models from human vision have been identified and might be causing these limitations. Consequently several attempts with varying success have been made to reduce these biases during training to improve generalization. We take a step back and sanity-check these attempts. Fixing the architecture to the well-established ResNet-50 we perform a large-scale study on 48 ImageNet models obtained via different training methods to understand how and if these biases - including shape bias spectral biases and critical bands - interact with generalization. Our extensive study results reveal that contrary to previous findings these biases are insufficient to accurately predict the generalization of a model holistically.

Since supervised data is often technically impossible to obtain assumptions and biases have to be imposed to solve this inverse problem and we choose to model them explicitly. Rather than initializing a latent irradiance (\"template\") by heuristics to estimate deformation we select one of the images as a reference and model the deformation in this image by the aggregation of the optical flow from it to other images exploiting a prior imposed by Central Limit Theorem. Then with a novel flow inversion module the model registers each image TO the template but WITHOUT the template avoiding artifacts related to poor template initialization. To illustrate the robustness of the method we simply (i) select the first frame as the reference and (ii) use the simplest optical flow to estimate the warpings yet the improvement in registration is decisive in the final reconstruction as we achieve state-of-the-art performance despite its simplicity. The method establishes a strong baseline that can be further improved by integrating it seamlessly into more sophisticated pipelines or with domain-specific methods if so desired."},

The input of the networks is a novel two-dimensional data structure with all the information needed for the network to infer a nonlinearity-free signal.

Distilling cross-modality matching knowledge from cross-encoder to dual-encoder provides a natural approach to harness their strengths. Thus we investigate the following valuable question: how to make cross-encoder a good teacher for dual-encoder? Our findings are threefold: (1) Cross-modal similarity score distribution of cross-encoder is more concentrated while the result of dual-encoder is nearly normal making vanilla logit distillation less effective. However ranking distillation remains practical as it is not affected by the score distribution. (2) Only the relative order between hard negatives conveys valid knowledge while the order information between easy negatives has little significance. (3) Maintaining the coordination between distillation loss and dual-encoder training loss is beneficial for knowledge transfer. Based on these findings we propose a novel Contrastive Partial Ranking Distillation (CPRD) method which implements the objective of mimicking relative order between hard negative samples with contrastive learning. This approach coordinates with the training of the dual-encoder effectively transferring valid knowledge from the cross-encoder to the dual-encoder. Extensive experiments on image-text retrieval and ranking tasks show that our method surpasses other distillation methods and significantly improves the accuracy of dual-encoder."},

In this paper we carefully design the QIP circuits from scratch whose complexity is in accordance with the theoretical complexity. To make the simulation tractable on classic computers especially when it is integrated in the gradient-based hybrid ML pipelines we further devise a highly-efficient simulation scheme by directly simulates the output state. Experiments show that the scheme accelerates the simulation for more than 68k times compared with the previous circuit simulator. This allows our empirical evaluation on typical machine learning tasks ranging from supervised and self-supervised learning via neural nets to K-Means clustering.

Different from previous approaches that use a single face encoder for identity preservation we propose multiple Pose-Adapted face Encodes (PAEs) to better preserve facial identity across large poses. Given a source face and a reference face the CSG generates a recomposed shape that fuses the source identity and reference action in the shape space and meets the cycle consistency requirement. Taking the shape code and the source as inputs the AEG learns the attention within the shape code and between the shape code and source style to enhance the generation of the desired target face.

Previous neural human reconstruction methods produce animatable avatars from sparse views using deformed Signed Distance Fields (SDF) but are non-relightable. While differentiable inverse rendering methods have succeeded in the material recovery of static objects it is not straightforward to extend them to dynamic humans since it is computationally intensive to compute pixel-surface intersection and light visibility on deformed SDFs for relighting. To solve this challenge we propose a Hierarchical Distance Query (HDQ) algorithm to approximate the world space SDF under arbitrary human poses. Specifically we estimate coarse SDF based on a parametric human model and compute fine SDF by exploiting the invariance of SDF w.r.t. local deformation. Based on HDQ we leverage sphere tracing to efficiently estimate the surface intersection and light visibility. This allows us to develop the first system to recover relightable and animatable neural avatars from sparse or monocular inputs.

The recent studies suggest that the existing learning-based trajectory prediction models do not posses such characteristics and are susceptible to small perturbations that are not present in the training data largely due to overfitting to spurious correlations while learning. In this paper we propose a causal disentanglement representation learning approach aiming to separate invariant (causal) and variant (spurious) features for more robust learning. Our method benefits from a novel intervention mechanism in the latent space that estimates potential distribution shifts resulted from spurious correlations using uncertain feature statistics hence maintaining the realism of interventions. To facilitate learning we propose a novel invariance objective based on the variances of the distributions over uncertain statistics to induce the model to focus on invariant representations during training. We conduct extensive experiments on two large-scale autonomous driving datasets and show that besides achieving state-of-the-art performance our method can significantly improve prediction robustness to various distribution shifts in driving scenes.

To address this Visual Prompt Tuning (VPT) incorporates learnable parameters in the input space of ViT. While freezing the ViT backbone and tuning only the prompts it exhibits superior performances to full fine-tuning. However despite the outstanding advantage we point out that VPT may lead to serious unfairness in downstream classification. Initially we investigate the causes of unfairness in VPT identifying the biasedly pre-trained ViT as a principal factor. Motivated by this observation we propose a Fair Visual Prompt Tuning (Fair-VPT) which removes biased information in the pre-trained ViT while adapting it to downstream classification tasks. To this end we categorize prompts into \"cleaner prompts\" and \"target prompts\". Based on this we encode the class token in two different ways by either masking or not masking the target prompts in the self-attention process. These encoded tokens are trained with distinct objective functions resulting in the inclusion of different information in the target and cleaner prompts. Moreover we introduce a disentanglement loss based on contrastive learning to further decorrelate them. In experiments across diverse benchmarks the proposed method demonstrates the most superior performance in terms of balanced classification accuracy and fairness."},
{"title": "Ensemble Diversity Facilitates Adversarial Transferability", "authors": "Bowen Tang, Zheng Wang, Yi Bin, Qi Dou, Yang Yang, Heng Tao Shen", "abstract": "With the advent of ensemble-based attacks the transferability of generated adversarial examples is elevated by a noticeable margin despite many methods only employing superficial integration yet ignoring the diversity between ensemble models. However most of them compromise the latent value of the diversity between generated perturbation from distinct models which we argue is also able to increase the adversarial transferability especially heterogeneous attacks. To address the issues we propose a novel method of Stochastic Mini-batch black-box attack with Ensemble Reweighing using reinforcement learning (SMER) to produce highly transferable adversarial examples. We emphasize the diversity between surrogate models achieving individual perturbation iteratively. In order to customize the individual effect between surrogates ensemble reweighing is introduced to refine ensemble weights by maximizing attack loss based on reinforcement learning which functions on the ultimate transferability elevation. Extensive experiments demonstrate our superiority to recent ensemble attacks with a significant margin across different black-box attack scenarios especially on heterogeneous conditions."},

While Neural Fields have recently become popular it is often trained by uniformly sampling the training domain or through handcrafted heuristics. We show that improved convergence and final training quality can be achieved by a soft mining technique based on importance sampling: rather than either considering or ignoring a pixel completely we weigh the corresponding loss by a scalar. To implement our idea we use Langevin Monte-Carlo sampling. We show that by doing so regions with higher error are being selected more frequently leading to more than 2x improvement in convergence speed.

To tackle this issue several anti-customization methods have been proposed in very recent months predominantly grounded in adversarial attacks. Unfortunately most of these methods adopt straightforward designs such as end-to-end optimization with a focus on adversarially maximizing the original training loss thereby neglecting nuanced internal properties intrinsic to the diffusion model and even leading to ineffective optimization in some diffusion time steps. In this paper we strive to bridge this gap by undertaking a comprehensive exploration of these inherent properties to boost the performance of current anti-customization approaches. Two aspects of properties are investigated: 1) We examine the relationship between time step selection and the model's perception in the frequency domain of images and find that lower time steps can give much more contributions to adversarial noises. This inspires us to propose an adaptive greedy search for optimal time steps that seamlessly integrates with existing anti-customization methods. 2) We scrutinize the roles of features at different layers during denoising and devise a sophisticated feature-based optimization framework for anti-customization. Experiments on facial benchmarks demonstrate that our approach significantly increases identity disruption thereby protecting user privacy and copyright.

However data often comes in an incremental manner in real-world applications where the data domain may increase dynamically. In this work we study catastrophic forgetting with data heterogeneity in Federated Incremental Learning (FIL) scenarios where edge clients may lack enough storage space to retain full data. We propose to employ a simple generic framework for FIL named Re-Fed which can coordinate each client to cache important samples for replay. More specifically when a new task arrives each client first caches selected previous samples based on their global and local importance. Then the client trains the local model with both the cached samples and the samples from the new task. Theoretically we analyze the ability of Re-Fed to discover important samples for replay thus alleviating the catastrophic forgetting problem. Moreover we empirically show that Re-Fed achieves competitive performance compared to state-of-the-art methods."},

However current research is mostly confined to certain modalities consuming considerable time and resources without achieving universality across different modalities. A straightforward solution is combining all modality data for joint SSL which poses practical challenges. Firstly our experiments reveal conflicts in representation learning as the number of modalities increases. Secondly multi-modal data collected in advance cannot cover all real-world scenarios. In this paper we reconsider versatile SSL from the perspective of continual learning and propose MedCoSS a continuous SSL approach for multi-modal medical data. Different from joint representation learning MedCoSS assigns varying data modalities to separate training stages creating a multi-stage pre-training process. We propose a rehearsal-based continual learning approach to manage modal conflicts and prevent catastrophic forgetting. Specifically we use the k-means sampling to retain and rehearse previous modality data during new modality learning. Moreover we apply feature distillation and intra-modal mixup on buffer data for knowledge retention bypassing pretext tasks. We conduct experiments on a large-scale multi-modal unlabeled dataset including clinical reports X-rays CT MRI and pathological images.

Existing visual feature extractors including ConvNets ViTs and MLPs represent an image as rectangular regions. Though prevalent such a grid-style paradigm is built upon engineering practice and lacks explicit modeling of data distribution. In this work we propose feature extraction with clustering (FEC) a conceptually elegant yet surprisingly ad-hoc interpretable neural clustering framework which views feature extraction as a process of selecting representatives from data and thus automatically captures the underlying data distribution. Given an image FEC alternates between grouping pixels into individual clusters to abstract representatives and updating the deep features of pixels with current representatives. Such an iterative working mechanism is implemented in the form of several neural layers and the final representatives can be used for downstream tasks. The cluster assignments across layers which can be viewed and inspected by humans make the forward process of FEC fully transparent and empower it with promising ad-hoc interpretability. Extensive experiments on various visual recognition models and tasks verify the effectiveness generality and interpretability of FEC. We expect this work will provoke a rethink of the current de facto grid-style paradigm."},

However almost all current multi-view systems rely on given ideal camera poses which are unavailable in many real-world scenarios such as autonomous driving. In this work we propose a new robustness benchmark to evaluate the depth estimation system under various noisy pose settings. Surprisingly we find current multi-view depth estimation methods or single-view and multi-view fusion methods will fail when given noisy pose settings. To address this challenge we propose a single-view and multi-view fused depth estimation system which adaptively integrates high-confident multi-view and single-view results for both robust and accurate depth estimations. The adaptive fusion module performs fusion by dynamically selecting high-confidence regions between two branches based on a wrapping confidence map. Thus the system tends to choose the more reliable branch when facing textureless scenes inaccurate calibration dynamic objects and other degradation or challenging conditions. Our method outperforms state-of-the-art multi-view and fusion methods under robustness testing. Furthermore we achieve state-of-the-art performance on challenging benchmarks (KITTI and DDAD) when given accurate pose estimations. Project website: https://github.com/Junda24/AFNet/"},
{"title": "Deep Imbalanced Regression via Hierarchical Classification Adjustment", "authors": "Haipeng Xiong, Angela Yao", "abstract": "Regression tasks in computer vision such as age estimation or counting are often formulated into classification by quantizing the target space into classes. Yet real-world data is often imbalanced -- the majority of training samples lie in a head range of target values while a minority of samples span a usually larger tail range. By selecting the class quantization one can adjust imbalanced regression targets into balanced classification outputs though there are trade-offs in balancing classification accuracy and quantization error. To improve regression performance over the entire range of data we propose to construct hierarchical classifiers for solving imbalanced regression tasks. The fine-grained classifiers limit the quantization error while being modulated by the coarse predictions to ensure high accuracy. Standard hierarchical classification approaches when applied to the regression problem fail to ensure that predicted ranges remain consistent across the hierarchy. As such we propose a range-preserving distillation process that effectively learns a single classifier from the set of hierarchical classifiers. Our novel hierarchical classification adjustment (HCA) for imbalanced regression shows superior results on three diverse tasks: age estimation crowd counting and depth estimation.

Although recent efforts have been made to compress StyleGAN while preserving its performance existing compressed models still lag behind the original model particularly in terms of sample diversity. To overcome this we propose a novel channel pruning method that leverages varying sensitivities of channels to latent vectors which is a key factor in sample diversity. Specifically by assessing channel importance based on their sensitivities to latent vector perturbations our method enhances the diversity of samples in the compressed model. Since our method solely focuses on the channel pruning stage it has complementary benefits with prior training schemes without additional training cost. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our method significantly enhances sample diversity across various datasets. Moreover in terms of FID scores our method not only surpasses state-of-the-art by a large margin but also achieves comparable scores with only half training iterations."},

However tuning VLMs for few-shot generalization tasks faces a discrimination -- generalization dilemma i.e. general knowledge should be preserved and task-specific knowledge should be fine-tuned. How to precisely identify these two types of representations remains a challenge. In this paper we propose a Multi-Modal Adapter (MMA) for VLMs to improve the alignment between representations from text and vision branches. MMA aggregates features from different branches into a shared feature space so that gradients can be communicated across branches. To determine how to incorporate MMA we systematically analyze the discriminability and generalizability of features across diverse datasets in both the vision and language branches and find that (1) higher layers contain discriminable dataset-specific knowledge while lower layers contain more generalizable knowledge and (2) language features are more discriminable than visual features and there are large semantic gaps between the features of the two modalities especially in the lower layers. Therefore we only incorporate MMA to a few higher layers of transformers to achieve an optimal balance between discrimination and generalization. We evaluate the effectiveness of our approach on three tasks: generalization to novel classes novel target datasets and domain generalization. Compared to many state-of-the-art methods our MMA achieves leading performance in all evaluations. Code is at https://github.com/ZjjConan/Multi-Modal-Adapter"},

Classifier models can be calibrated using Inductive Conformal Prediction but this requires holding back a sufficiently large calibration dataset for computing the distribution of non-conformity scores of the model's predictions. If one only requires only marginal calibration on the image level this calibration set consists of all individual pixels in the images available for calibration. However if the goal is to attain proper calibration for each individual pixel classifier the calibration set consists of individual images. In a scenario where data are scarce (such as the medical domain) it may not always be possible to set aside sufficiently many images for this pixel-level calibration.The method we propose dubbed \"Kandinsky calibration\" makes use of the spatial structure present in the distribution of natural images to simultaneously calibrate the classifiers of \"similar\" pixels. This can be seen as an intermediate approach between marginal (imagewise) and conditional (pixelwise) calibration where non-conformity scores are aggregated over similar image regions thereby making more efficient use of the images available for calibration. We run experiments on segmentation algorithms trained and calibrated on subsets of the public MS-COCO and Medical Decathlon datasets demonstrating that Kandinsky calibration method can significantly improve the coverage. When compared to both pixelwise and imagewise calibration on little data the Kandinsky method achieves much lower coverage errors indicating the data efficiency of the Kandinsky calibration."},

However a pivotal prerequisite for achieving this level of competitiveness is the significant communication and computation overheads when updating these models which prohibits the applications of them to real-world scenarios. To address this issue drawing inspiration from advanced model merging techniques without requiring additional training we introduce the Decentralized Iterative Merging-And-Training (DIMAT) paradigm--a novel decentralized deep learning framework. Within DIMAT each agent is trained on their local data and periodically merged with their neighboring agents using advanced model merging techniques like activation matching until convergence is achieved. DIMAT provably converges with the best available rate for nonconvex functions with various first-order methods while yielding tighter error bounds compared to the popular existing approaches. We conduct a comprehensive empirical analysis to validate DIMAT's superiority over baselines across diverse computer vision tasks sourced from multiple datasets. Empirical results validate our theoretical claims by showing that DIMAT attains faster and higher initial gain in accuracy with independent and identically distributed (IID) and non-IID data incurring lower communication overhead. This DIMAT paradigm presents a new opportunity for the future decentralized learning enhancing its adaptability to real-world with sparse and light-weight communication and computation."},

By exploiting the repetitive structures and volumetric coherence of EM images we propose the first generative learning-based framework for large-factor EMSR. Specifically motivated by the predictability of repetitive structures and textures in EM images we first learn a discrete codebook in the latent space to represent high-resolution (HR) cell-specific priors and a latent vector indexer to map low-resolution (LR) EM images to their corresponding latent vectors in a generative manner. By incorporating the generative cell-specific priors from HR EM images through a multi-scale prior fusion module we then deploy multi-image feature alignment and fusion to further exploit the inter-section coherence in the volumetric EM data.

Existing concept erasing methods in academia are all based on full parameter or specification-based fine-tuning from which we observe the following issues: 1) Generation alteration towards erosion: Parameter drift during target elimination causes alterations and potential deformations across all generations even eroding other concepts at varying degrees which is more evident with multi-concept erased; 2) Transfer inability & deployment inefficiency: Previous model-specific erasure impedes the flexible combination of concepts and the training-free transfer towards other models resulting in linear cost growth as the deployment scenarios increase. To achieve non-invasive precise customizable and transferable elimination we ground our erasing framework on one-dimensional adapters to erase multiple concepts from most DMs at once across versatile erasing applications. The concept-SemiPermeable structure is injected as a Membrane (SPM) into any DM to learn targeted erasing and meantime the alteration and erosion phenomenon is effectively mitigated via a novel Latent Anchoring fine-tuning strategy.

This paper endeavors to completely solve this issue in a theoretically guaranteed manner and puts an end to the ad-hoc efforts in this direction. Prior studies typically can only address one of the two cases of discontinuity: rotation and aspect ratio and often inadvertently introduce decoding discontinuity e.g. Decoding Incompleteness (DI) and Decoding Ambiguity (DA) as discussed in literature. Specifically we propose a novel representation method called Continuous OBB (COBB) which can be readily integrated into existing detectors e.g. Faster-RCNN as a plugin. It can theoretically ensure continuity in bounding box regression which to our best knowledge has not been achieved in literature for rectangle-based object representation.

A second and more recent approach referred to as Robust Super-Resolution (RSR) proposes to improve real-world SR by harnessing the generalization capabilities of a model by making it robust to adversarial attacks. To delve further into this second approach our paper explores the universality of various methods for enhancing the robustness of deep learning SR models. In other words we inquire: \\enquote Which robustness method exhibits the highest degree of adaptability when dealing with a wide range of adversarial attacks ? . Our extensive experimentation on both synthetic and real-world images empirically demonstrates that median randomized smoothing (MRS) is more general in terms of robustness compared to adversarial learning techniques which tend to focus on specific types of attacks. Furthermore as expected we also illustrate that the proposed universal robust method enables the SR model to handle standard corruptions more effectively such as blur and Gaussian noise and notably corruptions naturally present in real-world images. These results support the significance of shifting the paradigm in the development of real-world SR methods towards RSR especially via MRS."},

ConsistNet is an extension to the standard latent diffusion model and it consists of two submodules: (a) a view aggregation module that unprojects multi-view features into global 3D volumes and infers consistency and (b) a ray aggregation module that samples and aggregates 3D consistent features back to each view to enforce consistency. Our approach departs from previous methods in multi-view image generation in that it can be easily dropped in pre-trained LDMs without requiring explicit pixel correspondences or depth prediction.

Furthermore for safety-critical tasks the black-box nature of their decisions is problematic and explanations or at least methods which make decisions plausible are needed urgently. In this paper we address these problems by generating images that optimize a classifier-derived objective using a framework for guided image generation. We analyze the decisions of image classifiers by visual counterfactual explanations (VCEs) detection of systematic mistakes by analyzing images where classifiers maximally disagree and visualization of neurons and spurious features. In this way we validate existing observations e.g. the shape bias of adversarially robust models as well as novel failure modes e.g. systematic errors of zero-shot CLIP classifiers. Moreover our VCEs outperform previous work while being more versatile."},

Reconstructing multiple individuals moving and interacting naturally from monocular in-the-wild videos poses a challenging task. Addressing it necessitates precise pixel-level disentanglement of individuals without any prior knowledge about the subjects. Moreover it requires recovering intricate and complete 3D human shapes from short video sequences intensifying the level of difficulty. To tackle these challenges we first define a layered neural representation for the entire scene composited by individual human and background models. We learn the layered neural representation from videos via our layer-wise differentiable volume rendering. This learning process is further enhanced by our hybrid instance segmentation approach which combines the self-supervised 3D segmentation and the promptable 2D segmentation module yielding reliable instance segmentation supervision even under close human interaction. A confidence-guided optimization formulation is introduced to optimize the human poses and shape/appearance alternately. We incorporate effective objectives to refine human poses via photometric information and impose physically plausible constraints on human dynamics leading to temporally consistent 3D reconstructions with high fidelity. The evaluation of our method shows the superiority over prior art on publicly available datasets and in-the-wild videos."},

Due to the high relevance of image keypoints (e.g. for graph matching controlling generative models scene understanding etc.) in this work we specifically focus on inferring 3D structure in terms of sparse keypoints. Existing 3D keypoint inference approaches rely on strong priors such as spatio-temporal consistency multi-view images of the same object 3D shape priors (e.g. templates skeleton) or supervisory signals e.g. in the form of 2D keypoint annotations. In contrast we propose the first unsupervised 3D keypoint inference approach that can be trained for general object categories solely from an inhomogeneous image collection (containing different instances of objects from the same category). Our experiments show that our method not only improves upon unsupervised 2D keypoint inference but more importantly it also produces reasonable 3D structure for various object categories both qualitatively and quantitatively."},

In comparison to CNN-based approaches transformers with self-attention module have a better capacity to capture long-range dependencies and low-frequency semantic information of a portrait. However recent research shows that the self-attention mechanism struggles with modeling high-frequency contour information and capturing fine contour details which can lead to bias while predicting the portrait's contours. To deal with this issue we propose EFormer to enhance the model's attention towards both the low-frequency semantic and high-frequency contour features. For the high-frequency contours our research demonstrates that cross-attention module between different resolutions can guide our model to allocate attention appropriately to these contour regions. Supported by this we can successfully extract the high-frequency detail information around the portrait's contours which were previously ignored by self-attention. Based on the cross-attention module we further build a semantic and contour detector (SCD) to accurately capture both the low-frequency semantic and high-frequency contour features. And we design a contour-edge extraction branch and semantic extraction branch to extract refined high-frequency contour features and complete low-frequency semantic information respectively. Finally we fuse the two kinds of features and leverage the segmentation head to generate a predicted portrait matte. Experiments on VideoMatte240K (JPEG SD Format) and Adobe Image Matting (AIM) datasets demonstrate that EFormer outperforms previous portrait matte methods."},

Spectral RS images have two main traits: (1) multiple bands capturing diverse feature information (2) spatial alignment and consistent spectral sequencing within the spatial-spectral dimension. In this paper we introduce Spatial-SpectralMAE (S2MAE) a specialized pre-trained architecture for spectral RS imagery. S2MAE employs a 3D transformer for masked autoencoder modeling integrating learnable spectral-spatial embeddings with a 90% masking ratio. The model efficiently captures local spectral consistency and spatial invariance using compact cube tokens demonstrating versatility to diverse input characteristics. This adaptability facilitates progressive pretraining on extensive spectral datasets. The effectiveness of S2MAE is validated through continuous pretraining on two sizable datasets totaling over a million training images. The pre-trained model is subsequently applied to three distinct downstream tasks with in-depth ablation studies conducted to emphasize its efficacy."},

However existing regression-based methods discard the spatial location prior in input image with a global pooling leading to inferior accuracy and are limited to single instance localization tasks. We study the regression-based keypoint localization from a new perspective by leveraging the spatial location prior. Instead of regressing on the pooled feature the proposed Spatial-Aware Regression (SAR) maintains the spatial location map and outputs spatial coordinates and confidence score for each grid which are optimized with a unified objective. Benefited by the location prior these spatial-aware outputs can be efficiently optimized resulting in better localization performance. Moreover incorporating spatial prior makes SAR more general and can be applied into various keypoint localization tasks. We test the proposed method in 4 keypoint localization tasks including single/multi-person 2D/3D pose estimation and the whole-body pose estimation. Extensive experiments demonstrate its promising performance e.g. consistently outperforming recent regressions-based methods."},

While text is widely used for inter-category retrieval tasks sketches have been established as the sole preferred modality for fine-grained image retrieval due to their ability to capture intricate visual details. In this paper we question the reliance on sketches alone for fine-grained image retrieval by simultaneously exploring the fine-grained representation capabilities of both sketch and text orchestrating a duet between the two. The end result enables precise retrievals previously unattainable allowing users to pose ever-finer queries and incorporate attributes like colour and contextual cues from text. For this purpose we introduce a novel compositionality framework effectively combining sketches and text using pre-trained CLIP models while eliminating the need for extensive fine-grained textual descriptions.

Our approach reestablishes the training objective by integrating the guidance of the observation process with the Markov chain in a principled way. This is achieved by introducing an additional loss term derived from the observation based on a conditional discriminator on noise level which employs a Bernoulli distribution indicating whether its input lies on the (noisy) real manifold or not. This strategy allows us to optimize the more accurate negative log-likelihood induced in the inference stage especially when the number of function evaluations is limited. The proposed training scheme is also advantageous even when incorporated only into the fine-tuning process and it is compatible with various fast inference strategies since our method yields better denoising networks using the exactly the same inference procedure without incurring extra computational cost.

Traditional methods have focused on designing learning objectives and additional modules to isolate domain-specific features while retaining domain-invariant characteristics in their representations. However such approaches often lack guarantees of consistent maintenance of domain-invariant features or the complete removal of domain-specific features. Furthermore most prior works of DG for FAS do not ensure convergence to a local flat minimum which has been shown to be advantageous for DG. In this paper we introduce GAC-FAS a novel learning objective that encourages the model to converge towards an optimal flat minimum without necessitating additional learning modules. Unlike conventional sharpness-aware minimizers GAC-FAS identifies ascending points for each domain and regulates the generalization gradient updates at these points to align coherently with empirical risk minimization (ERM) gradient updates. This unique approach specifically guides the model to be robust against domain shifts. We demonstrate the efficacy of GAC-FAS through rigorous testing on challenging cross-domain FAS datasets where it establishes state-of-the-art performance."},

Shape-from-Template (SfT) methods aim to reconstruct a template-based geometry from RGB images or video sequences often leveraging just a single monocular camera without depth information such as regular smartphone recordings. Unfortunately existing reconstruction methods are either unphysical and noisy or slow in optimization. To solve this problem we propose a novel SfT reconstruction algorithm for cloth using a pre-trained neural surrogate model that is fast to evaluate stable and produces smooth reconstructions due to a regularizing physics simulation. Differentiable rendering of the simulated mesh enables pixel-wise comparisons between the reconstruction and a target video sequence that can be used for a gradient-based optimization procedure to extract not only shape information but also physical parameters such as stretching shearing or bending stiffness of the cloth. This allows to retain a precise stable and smooth reconstructed geometry while reducing the runtime by a factor of 400-500 compared to ?-SfT a state-of-the-art physics-based SfT approach."},

Existing methods jointly estimate pixel-wise depth and motion relying mainly on an image reconstruction loss. Dynamic regions remain a critical challenge for these methods due to the inherent ambiguity in depth and motion estimation resulting in inaccurate depth estimation. This paper proposes a self-supervised training framework exploiting pseudo depth labels for dynamic regions from training data. The key contribution of our framework is to decouple depth estimation for static and dynamic regions of images in the training data. We start with an unsupervised depth estimation approach which provides reliable depth estimates for static regions and motion cues for dynamic regions and allows us to extract moving object information at the instance level. In the next stage we use an object network to estimate the depth of those moving objects assuming rigid motions. Then we propose a new scale alignment module to address the scale ambiguity between estimated depths for static and dynamic regions. We can then use the depth labels generated to train an end-to-end depth estimation network and improve its performance. Extensive experiments on the Cityscapes and KITTI datasets show that our self-training strategy consistently outperforms existing self-/unsupervised depth estimation methods."},

However this multimodal task is particularly challenging due to the different nature of these data: WSIs represent a very high-dimensional spatial description of a tumor while bulk transcriptomics represent a global description of gene expression levels within that tumor. In this context our work aims to address two key challenges: (1) how can we tokenize transcriptomics in a semantically meaningful and interpretable way? and (2) how can we capture dense multimodal interactions between these two modalities? Here we propose to learn biological pathway tokens from transcriptomics that can encode specific cellular functions. Together with histology patch tokens that encode the slide morphology we argue that they form appropriate reasoning units for interpretability. We fuse both modalities using a memory-efficient multimodal Transformer that can model interactions between pathway and histology patch tokens. Our model SURVPATH achieves state-of-the-art performance when evaluated against unimodal and multimodal baselines on five datasets from The Cancer Genome Atlas.

To address this issue we propose a novel Implicit Discriminative Knowledge Learning (IDKL) network to uncover and leverage the implicit discriminative information contained within the modality-specific. First we extract modality-specific and modality-shared features using a novel dual-stream network. Then the modality-specific features undergo purification to reduce their modality style discrepancies while preserving identity-aware discriminative knowledge. Subsequently this kind of implicit knowledge is distilled into the modality-shared feature to enhance its distinctiveness. Finally an alignment loss is proposed to minimize modality discrepancy on enhanced modality-shared features.

Most existing FFG methods follow the style-content disentanglement paradigm and employ the Generative Adversarial Network (GAN) to generate target fonts by combining the decoupled content and style representations. The complicated structure and detailed style are simultaneously generated in those methods which may be the sub-optimal solutions for FFG task. Inspired by most manual font design processes of expert designers in this paper we model font generation as a multi-stage generative process. Specifically as the injected noise and the data distribution in diffusion models can be well-separated into different sub-spaces we are able to incorporate the font transfer process into these models. Based on this observation we generalize diffusion methods to model font generative process by separating the reverse diffusion process into three stages with different functions: The structure construction stage first generates the structure information for the target character based on the source image and the font transfer stage subsequently transforms the source font to the target font. Finally the font refinement stage enhances the appearances and local details of the target font images. Based on the above multi-stage generative process we construct our font generation framework named MSD-Font with a dual-network approach to generate font images.

Using TIA we free the humongous backbone from learning to adapt to the TAD task by only updating the parameters in TIA. TIA also leads to better TAD representation by temporally aggregating context from adjacent frames throughout the backbone. We evaluate our model across four representative datasets.

While traditional diffusion-based SR techniques have demonstrated remarkable abilities to enhance image detail they are prone to artifact introduction during iterative procedures. Such artifacts ranging from trivial noise to unauthentic textures deviate from the true structure of the source image thus challenging the integrity of the super-resolution process. In this work we propose Self-Adaptive Reality-Guided Diffusion (SARGD) a training-free method that delves into the latent space to effectively identify and mitigate the propagation of artifacts. Our SARGD begins by using an artifact detector to identify implausible pixels creating a binary mask that highlights artifacts. Following this the Reality Guidance Refinement (RGR) process refines artifacts by integrating this mask with realistic latent representations improving alignment with the original image. Nonetheless initial realistic-latent representations from lower-quality images result in over-smoothing in the final output. To address this we introduce a Self-Adaptive Guidance (SAG) mechanism. It dynamically computes a reality score enhancing the sharpness of the realistic latent. These alternating mechanisms collectively achieve artifact-free super-resolution.

Systematically measuring the reliability of photometric stereo methods in handling such complex reflectance necessitates a real-world dataset with quantitatively controlled reflectances. This paper introduces DiLiGenRT the first real-world dataset for evaluating photometric stereo methods under quantified reflectances by manufacturing 54 hemispheres with varying degrees of two reflectance properties: Roughness and Translucency. Unlike qualitative and semantic labels such as diffuse and specular that have been used in previous datasets our quantified dataset allows comprehensive and systematic benchmark evaluations.

The key challenge addressed is generating high-quality textures without embedded illumination information which allows the textures to be re-lighted or re-edited within modern graphics pipelines. To achieve this our method first leverages a pre-trained depth-aware 2D diffusion model to generate view-conditional images and perform multi-view texture fusion producing an initial coarse texture map. However as 2D models cannot fully represent 3D shapes and disable lighting effects the coarse texture map exhibits incomplete areas and illumination artifacts. To resolve this we train separate UV Inpainting and UVHD diffusion models specialized for the shape-aware refinement of incomplete areas and the removal of illumination artifacts. Through this coarse-to-fine process Paint3D can produce high-quality 2K UV textures that maintain semantic consistency while being lighting-less significantly advancing the state-of-the-art in texturing 3D objects."},

Our model-driven RSFNet estimates these factors by unrolling the optimization into network layers requiring only a few scalars to be learned. The resultant factors are interpretable by design and can be fused for different image enhancement tasks via a network or combined directly by the user in a controllable fashion. Based on RSFNet we detail a zero-reference Low Light Enhancement (LLE) application trained without paired or unpaired supervision. Our system improves the state-of-the-art performance on standard benchmarks and achieves better generalization on multiple other datasets. We also integrate our factors with other task specific fusion networks for applications like deraining deblurring and dehazing with negligible overhead thereby highlighting the multi-domain and multi-task generalizability of our proposed RSFNet.

Prompt learning methods built with VL models generate text features from the class names that only have confined class-specific information. Large Language Models (LLMs) with their vast encyclopedic knowledge emerge as the complement. Thus in this paper we discuss the integration of LLMs to enhance pre-trained VL models specifically on low-shot classification. However the domain gap between language and vision blocks the direct application of LLMs. Thus we propose LLaMP Large Language Models as Prompt learners that produces adaptive prompts for the CLIP text encoder establishing it as the connecting bridge. Experiments show that compared with other state-of-the-art prompt learning methods LLaMP yields better performance on both zero-shot generalization and few-shot image classification over a spectrum of 11 datasets.

In contrast learning in humans often involves additional detailed guidance throughout the interactive learning process i.e. where feedback often via language provides detailed information as to which part of their trial was performed incorrectly or suboptimally and why. Motivated by this observation we introduce an efficient feedback-based framework for improving behavior-cloning-based training of sensorimotor driving agents. Our key insight is to leverage recent advances in Large Language Models (LLMs) to provide corrective fine-grained feedback regarding the underlying reason behind driving prediction failures. Moreover our introduced network architecture is efficient enabling the first sensorimotor end-to-end training and evaluation of LLM-based driving models. The resulting agent achieves state-of-the-art performance in open-loop evaluation on nuScenes outperforming prior state-of-the-art by over 8.1% and 57.1% in accuracy and collision rate respectively. In CARLA our camera-based agent improves by 16.6% in driving score over prior LIDAR-based approaches."},

Despite the promising performance this approach introduces heavy computational overheads for two challenges: 1) large model sizes of the backbone; 2) expensive costs during the fine-tuning. These challenges hinder this OVS strategy from being widely applicable and affordable in real-world scenarios. Although traditional methods such as model compression and efficient fine-tuning can address these challenges they often rely on heuristics. This means that their solutions cannot be easily transferred and necessitate re-training on different models which comes at a cost. In the context of efficient OVS we target achieving performance that is comparable to or even better than prior OVS works based on large vision-language foundation models by utilizing smaller models that incur lower training costs. The core strategy is to make our efficiency principled and thus seamlessly transferable from one OVS framework to others without further customization. Comprehensive experiments on diverse OVS benchmarks demonstrate our superior trade-off between segmentation accuracy and computation costs over previous works.

However emotions are often compound e.g. happily surprised and can be mapped to the action units (AUs) used for expressing emotions and trivially to the canonical ones. Intuitively emotions are continuous as represented by the arousal-valence (AV) model. An interpretable unification of these four modalities --namely Canonical Compound AUs and AV-- is highly desirable for a better representation and understanding of emotions. However such unification remains to be unknown in the current literature. In this work we propose an interpretable and unified emotion model referred as C2A2. We also develop a method that leverages labels of the non-unified models to annotate the novel unified one. Finally we modify the text-conditional diffusion models to understand continuous numbers which are then used to generate continuous expressions using our unified emotion model. Through quantitative and qualitative experiments we show that our generated images are rich and capture subtle expressions. Our work allows a fine-grained generation of expressions in conjunction with other textual inputs and offers a new label space for emotions at the same time."},

To remedy these limitations we propose a one-stage end-to-end framework termed OED which streamlines the DSGG pipeline. This framework reformulates the task as a set prediction problem and leverages pair-wise features to represent each subject-object pair within the scene graph.

This development has led to a significant shift in focus transitioning from the traditional method of \"building models from scratch\" to a strategy centered on \"efficiently utilizing the capabilities of foundation models to extract relevant prior knowledge tailored for OFSL and apply it judiciously\". Amidst this backdrop we unveil the Direct-and-Inverse CLIP (DeIL) an innovative method leveraging our proposed \"Direct-and-Inverse\" concept to activate CLIP-based methods for addressing OFSL. This concept transforms conventional single-step classification into a nuanced two-stage process: initially filtering out less probable categories followed by accurately determining the specific category of samples.

Our study introduces Upscale-A-Video a text-guided latent diffusion framework for video upscaling. This framework ensures temporal coherence through two key mechanisms: locally it integrates temporal layers into U-Net and VAE-Decoder maintaining consistency within short sequences; globally without training a flow-guided recurrent latent propagation module is introduced to enhance overall video stability by propagating and fusing latent across the entire sequences. Thanks to the diffusion paradigm our model also offers greater flexibility by allowing text prompts to guide texture creation and adjustable noise levels to balance restoration and generation enabling a trade-off between fidelity and quality.

DQA poses significant challenges such as the demand for domain-specific knowledge and the scarcity of annotated data which restrict the applicability of large-scale deep models. Previous approaches have explored external knowledge integration through pre-training but these methods are costly and can be limited by domain disparities.

In this paper we leverage the event camera to facilitate the separation of direct and global components enabling video-rate separation of high quality. In detail we adopt an event camera to record rapid illumination changes caused by the shadow of a line occluder sweeping over the scene and reconstruct the coarse separation results through event accumulation.

To realize this idea we devise a hybrid point-volumetric representation for geometry and a regularized basis-BRDF representation for reflectance. The hybrid geometric representation enables fast rendering through point-based splatting while retaining the geometric details and stability inherent to SDF-based representations. The regularized basis-BRDF mitigates the ill-posedness of inverse rendering stemming from limited light-view angular samples.

Our extensive evaluations demonstrate that DPIR outperforms prior works in terms of reconstruction accuracy computational efficiency and memory footprint. Furthermore our explicit point-based representation and rendering enables intuitive geometry and reflectance editing."},

To alleviate the disruption of discriminative identity representation by dramatic view discrepancy as the most significant challenge in AGPReID the view-decoupled transformer (VDT) is proposed as a simple yet effective framework. Two major components are designed in VDT to decouple view-related and view-unrelated features namely hierarchical subtractive separation and orthogonal loss where the former separates these two features inside the VDT and the latter constrains these two to be independent.

Methods that use Neural Radiance fields are versatile for traditional tasks such as novel view synthesis. In recent times some work has emerged that aims to extend the functionality of NeRF beyond view synthesis for semantically aware tasks such as editing and segmentation using 3D feature field distillation from 2D foundation models. However these methods have two major limitations: (a) they are limited by the rendering speed of NeRF pipelines and (b) implicitly represented feature fields suffer from continuity artifacts reducing feature quality. Recently 3D Gaussian Splatting has shown state-of-the-art performance on real-time radiance field rendering. In this work we go one step further: in addition to radiance field rendering we enable 3D Gaussian splatting on arbitrary-dimension semantic features via 2D foundation model distillation. This translation is not straightforward: naively incorporating feature fields in the 3DGS framework encounters significant challenges notably the disparities in spatial resolution and channel consistency between RGB images and feature maps. We propose architectural and training changes to efficiently avert this problem. Our proposed method is general and our experiments showcase novel view semantic segmentation language-guided editing and segment anything through learning feature fields from state-of-the-art 2D foundation models such as SAM and CLIP-LSeg. Across experiments our distillation method is able to provide comparable or better results while being significantly faster to both train and render.

These models are widely used for data augmentation and creative applications. However DMs reflect the biases present in the training datasets. This is especially concerning in the context of faces where the DM prefers one demographic subgroup vs others (eg. female vs male). In this work we present a method for debiasing DMs without relying on additional reference data or model retraining. Specifically we propose Distribution Guidance which enforces the generated images to follow the prescribed attribute distribution. To realize this we build on the key insight that the latent features of denoising UNet hold rich demographic semantics and the same can be leveraged to guide debiased generation. We train Attribute Distribution Predictor (ADP) - a small mlp that maps the latent features to the distribution of attributes. ADP is trained with pseudo labels generated from existing attribute classifiers. The proposed Distribution Guidance with ADP enables us to do fair generation. Our method reduces bias across single/multiple attributes and outperforms the baseline by a significant margin for unconditional and text-conditional diffusion models.

This problem is especially challenging for diffuse objects: it is ill-conditioned because diffuse materials severely blur incoming light and it is ill-posed because diffuse materials under high-frequency lighting can be indistinguishable from shiny materials under low-frequency lighting. We show that it is possible to recover precise materials and illumination---even from diffuse objects---by exploiting unintended shadows like the ones cast onto an object by the photographer who moves around it. These shadows are a nuisance in most previous inverse rendering pipelines but here we exploit them as signals that improve conditioning and help resolve material-lighting ambiguities.

Given a target video these two fields are jointly optimized to reconstruct it through a carefully tailored rendering pipeline. We advisedly introduce some regularizations into the optimization process urging the canonical content field to inherit semantics (e.g. the object shape) from the video. With such a design CoDeF naturally supports lifting image algorithms for video processing in the sense that one can apply an image algorithm to the canonical image and effortlessly propagate the outcomes to the entire video with the aid of the temporal deformation field. We experimentally show that CoDeF is able to lift image-to-image translation to video-to-video translation and lift keypoint detection to keypoint tracking without any training. More importantly thanks to our lifting strategy that deploys the algorithms on only one image we achieve superior cross-frame consistency in processed videos compared to existing video-to-video translation approaches and even manage to track non-rigid objects like water and smog.

According to the principle of feature-matching learning existing fusion-based methods usually fuse different features by using similarity measurements or attention mechanisms which may match features inaccurately and lead to artifacts in the texture and structure of generated images. In this paper we propose an exact Fusion via Feature Distribution matching Generative Adversarial Network (F2DGAN) for few-shot image generation. The rationale behind this is that feature distribution matching is much more reliable than feature matching to explore the statistical characters in image feature space for limited real-world data. To model feature distributions from only a few examples for feature fusion we design a novel variational feature distribution matching fusion module to perform exact fusion by empirical cumulative distribution functions. Specifically we employ a variational autoencoder to transform deep image features into distributions and fuse different features exactly by applying histogram matching. Additionally we formulate two effective losses to guide the matching process for better fitting our fusion strategy. Extensive experiments compared with state-of-the-art methods on three public datasets demonstrate the superiority of F2DGAN for few-shot image generation in terms of generation quality and diversity and the effectiveness of data augmentation in downstream classification tasks."},

In this work we introduce Universal Semi-Supervised Domain Adaptation (UniSSDA) a practical yet challenging setting where the target domain is partially labeled and the source and target label space may not strictly match. UniSSDA is at the intersection of Universal Domain Adaptation (UniDA) and Semi-Supervised Domain Adaptation (SSDA): the UniDA setting does not allow for fine-grained categorization of target private classes not represented in the source domain while SSDA focuses on the restricted closed-set setting where source and target label spaces match exactly. Existing UniDA and SSDA methods are susceptible to common-class bias in UniSSDA settings where models overfit to data distributions of classes common to both domains at the expense of private classes. We propose a new prior-guided pseudo-label refinement strategy to reduce the reinforcement of common-class bias due to pseudo-labeling a common label propagation strategy in domain adaptation. We demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed strategy on benchmark datasets Office-Home DomainNet and VisDA.

In this paper we introduce DEADiff to address this issue using the following two strategies: 1) a mechanism to decouple the style and semantics of reference images. The decoupled feature representations are first extracted by Q-Formers which are instructed by different text descriptions. Then they are injected into mutually exclusive subsets of cross-attention layers for better disentanglement. 2) A non-reconstructive learning method. The Q-Formers are trained using paired images rather than the identical target in which the reference image and the ground-truth image are with the same style or semantics. We show that DEADiff attains the best visual stylization results and optimal balance between the text controllability inherent in the text-to-image model and style similarity to the reference image as demonstrated both quantitatively and qualitatively.

{"title": "SwiftBrush: One-Step Text-to-Image Diffusion Model with Variational Score Distillation", "authors": "Thuan Hoang Nguyen, Anh Tran", "abstract": "Despite their ability to generate high-resolution and diverse images from text prompts text-to-image diffusion models often suffer from slow iterative sampling processes. Model distillation is one of the most effective directions to accelerate these models. However previous distillation methods fail to retain the generation quality while requiring a significant amount of images for training either from real data or synthetically generated by the teacher model. In response to this limitation we present a novel image-free distillation scheme named SwiftBrush. Drawing inspiration from text-to-3D synthesis in which a 3D neural radiance field that aligns with the input prompt can be obtained from a 2D text-to-image diffusion prior via a specialized loss without the use of any 3D data ground-truth our approach re-purposes that same loss for distilling a pretrained multi-step text-to-image model to a student network that can generate high-fidelity images with just a single inference step. In spite of its simplicity our model stands as one of the first one-step text-to-image generators that can produce images of comparable quality to Stable Diffusion without reliance on any training image data. Remarkably SwiftBrush achieves an FID score of 16.67 and a CLIP score of 0.29 on the COCO-30K benchmark achieving competitive results or even substantially surpassing existing state-of-the-art distillation techniques."},

We build a bridge between identities and model behavior safeguarding POI identities rather than merely certain face images. Given a face editing model IDGuard enables it to reject editing any image containing POI identities while retaining its editing functionality for regular use. Specifically we insert an ID Normalization Layer into the original face editing model and introduce an ID Extractor to extract the identities of input images. To differentiate the editing behavior between POI and nonPOI we use a transformer-based ID Encoder to encode extracted POI identities as parameters of the ID Normalization Layer. Our method supports the simultaneous protection of multiple POI and allows for the addition of new POI in the inference stage without the need for retraining. Extensive experiments show that our method achieves 100% protection accuracy on POI images even if they are neither included in the training set nor subject to any preprocessing. Notably our method exhibits excellent robustness against image and model attacks and maintains 100% protection performance when generalized to various face editing models further demonstrating its practicality."},
{"title": "BilevelPruning: Unified Dynamic and Static Channel Pruning for Convolutional Neural Networks", "authors": "Shangqian Gao, Yanfu Zhang, Feihu Huang, Heng Huang", "abstract": "Most existing dynamic or runtime channel pruning methods have to store all weights to achieve efficient inference which brings extra storage costs. Static pruning methods can reduce storage costs directly but their performance is limited by using a fixed sub-network to approximate the original model. Most existing pruning works suffer from these drawbacks because they were designed to only conduct either static or dynamic pruning. In this paper we propose a novel method to solve both efficiency and storage challenges via simultaneously conducting dynamic and static channel pruning for convolutional neural networks. We propose a new bi-level optimization based model to naturally integrate the static and dynamic channel pruning. By doing so our method enjoys benefits from both sides and the disadvantages of dynamic and static pruning are reduced. After pruning we permanently remove redundant parameters and then finetune the model with dynamic flexibility. Experimental results on CIFAR-10 and ImageNet datasets suggest that our method can achieve state-of-the-art performance compared to existing dynamic and static channel pruning methods."},

Due to the absence of information on unknown classes existing methods mainly transfer knowledge of known classes while roughly grouping unknown classes as one attenuating the knowledge transfer and generalization. In contrast this paper advocates that exploring unknown classes can better identify known ones and proposes a domain adaptation model to transfer knowledge on known and unknown classes jointly. Specifically given a source pre-trained model we first introduce an unknown diffuser that can determine whether classes in space need to be split and merged through similarity measures to estimate and generate a wider class space distribution including known and unknown classes. Based on such a wider space distribution we enhance the reliability of known class knowledge in the source pre-trained model through contrastive constraint. Finally various supervision information including reliable known class knowledge and clustered pseudo-labels optimize the model for impressive knowledge transfer and generalization. Extensive experiments show that our network can achieve superior exploration and knowledge generalization on unknown classes while with excellent known class transfer.

In this paper we contribute from two aspects. 1) We propose four architectural guidelines for designing large-kernel ConvNets the core of which is to exploit the essential characteristics of large kernels that distinguish them from small kernels - they can see wide without going deep. Following such guidelines our proposed large-kernel ConvNet shows leading performance in image recognition (ImageNet accuracy of 88.0% ADE20K mIoU of 55.6% and COCO box AP of 56.4%) demonstrating better performance and higher speed than the recent powerful competitors. 2) We discover large kernels are the key to unlocking the exceptional performance of ConvNets in domains where they were originally not proficient. With certain modality-related preprocessing approaches the proposed model achieves state-of-the-art performance on time-series forecasting and audio recognition tasks even without modality-specific customization to the architecture.

To address this we are the first to introduce a robustness benchmark for DLA models which includes 450K document images of three datasets. To cover realistic corruptions we propose a perturbation taxonomy with 12 common document perturbations with 3 severity levels inspired by real-world document processing. Additionally to better understand document perturbation impacts we propose two metrics Mean Perturbation Effect (mPE) for perturbation assessment and Mean Robustness Degradation (mRD) for robustness evaluation. Furthermore we introduce a self-titled model i.e. Robust Document Layout Analyzer (RoDLA) which improves attention mechanisms to boost extraction of robust features. Experiments on the proposed benchmarks (PubLayNet-P DocLayNet-P and M6Doc-P) demonstrate that RoDLA obtains state-of-the-art mRD scores of 115.7 135.4 and 150.4 respectively.

Existing methods mostly focusing on two-view point tracking often ignore the rich temporal context in the image sequence thereby overlooking the global motion patterns and providing no assessment of the full trajectory reliability. These shortcomings hinder performance in scenarios with occlusion dynamic objects and low-texture areas. To address these challenges we present the Long-term Effective Any Point Tracking (LEAP) module. LEAP innovatively combines visual inter-track and temporal cues with mindfully selected anchors for dynamic track estimation. Moreover LEAP's temporal probabilistic formulation integrates distribution updates into a learnable iterative refinement module to reason about point-wise uncertainty. Based on these traits we develop LEAP-VO a robust visual odometry system adept at handling occlusions and dynamic scenes. Our mindful integration showcases a novel practice by employing long-term point tracking as the front-end. Extensive experiments demonstrate that the proposed pipeline significantly outperforms existing baselines across various visual odometry benchmarks."},

Existing methodologies perform language-based and template-based matching for target reasoning separately and merge the matching results from two sources which suffer from tracking drift when language and visual templates miss-align with the dynamic target state and ambiguity in the later merging stage. To tackle the issues we propose a joint multi-modal tracking framework with 1) a prompt modulation module to leverage the complementarity between temporal visual templates and language expressions enabling precise and context-aware appearance and linguistic cues and 2) a unified target decoding module to integrate the multi-modal reference cues and executes the integrated queries on the search image to predict the target location in an end-to-end manner directly. This design ensures spatio-temporal consistency by leveraging historical visual information and introduces an integrated solution generating predictions in a single step. Extensive experiments conducted on TNL2K OTB-Lang LaSOT and RefCOCOg validate the efficacy of our proposed approach.

In analogy with GANs those noise maps could be considered as the latent code associated with the generated image. However this native noise space does not possess a convenient structure and is thus challenging to work with in editing tasks. Here we propose an alternative latent noise space for DDPM that enables a wide range of editing operations via simple means and present an inversion method for extracting these edit-friendly noise maps for any given image (real or synthetically generated). As opposed to the native DDPM noise space the edit-friendly noise maps do not have a standard normal distribution and are not statistically independent across timesteps. However they allow perfect reconstruction of any desired image and simple transformations on them translate into meaningful manipulations of the output image (e.g. shifting color edits). Moreover in text-conditional models fixing those noise maps while changing the text prompt modifies semantics while retaining structure. We illustrate how this property enables text-based editing of real images via the diverse DDPM sampling scheme (in contrast to the popular non-diverse DDIM inversion). We also show how it can be used within existing diffusion-based editing methods to improve their quality and diversity. The code of the method is attached to this submission."},

The observations motivate our unified framework of disentangling the dynamic and static information in the videos. It first distills the videos into still images as static memory and then compensates the dynamic and motion information with a learnable dynamic memory block.

Previous US-VI-ReID works gravitate toward learning cross-modality information with the deep features extracted from the ultimate layer. Nevertheless interfered by the multiple discrepancies solely relying on deep features is insufficient for accurately learning modality-invariant features resulting in negative optimization. The shallow feature from the shallow layers contains nuanced detail information which is critical for effective cross-modality learning but is disregarded regrettably by the existing methods. To address the above issues we design a Shallow-Deep Collaborative Learning (SDCL) framework based on the transformer with shallow-deep contrastive learning incorporating Collaborative Neighbor Learning (CNL) and Collaborative Ranking Association (CRA) module. Specifically CNL unveils the intrinsic homogeneous and heterogeneous collaboration which are harnessed for neighbor alignment enhancing the robustness in a dynamic manner. Furthermore CRA associates the cross-modality labels with the ranking association between shallow and deep features furnishing valuable supervision for cross-modality learning.

Most multi-task learning methods depend on fully labeled datasets wherein each input example is accompanied by ground-truth labels for all target tasks. Unfortunately curating such datasets can be prohibitively expensive and impractical especially for dense prediction tasks which require per-pixel labels for each image. With this in mind we propose Joint-Task Regularization (JTR) an intuitive technique which leverages cross-task relations to simultaneously regularize all tasks in a single joint-task latent space to improve learning when data is not fully labeled for all tasks. JTR stands out from existing approaches in that it regularizes all tasks jointly rather than separately in pairs---therefore it achieves linear complexity relative to the number of tasks while previous methods scale quadratically. To demonstrate the validity of our approach we extensively benchmark our method across a wide variety of partially labeled scenarios based on NYU-v2 Cityscapes and Taskonomy."},

The trade-off between the imperceptibility and adversarial strength leads most point attack methods to inevitably introduce easily detectable outlier points upon a successful attack. Another promising strategy shape-based attack can effectively eliminate outliers but existing methods often suffer significant reductions in imperceptibility due to irrational deformations. We find that concealing deformation perturbations in areas insensitive to human eyes can achieve a better trade-off between imperceptibility and adversarial strength specifically in parts of the object surface that are complex and exhibit drastic curvature changes. Therefore we propose a novel shape-based adversarial attack method HiT-ADV which initially conducts a two-stage search for attack regions based on saliency and imperceptibility scores and then adds deformation perturbations in each attack region using Gaussian kernel functions. Additionally HiT-ADV is extendable to physical attack. We propose that by employing benign resampling and benign rigid transformations we can further enhance physical adversarial strength with little sacrifice to imperceptibility. Extensive experiments have validated the superiority of our method in terms of adversarial and imperceptible properties in both digital and physical spaces."},

However it is still challenging for previous methods to preserve both the identity similarity and editability due to overfitting to training samples. In this paper we propose Face2Diffusion (F2D) for high-editability face personalization. The core idea behind F2D is that removing identity-irrelevant information from the training pipeline prevents the overfitting problem and improves editability of encoded faces. F2D consists of the following three novel components: 1) Multi-scale identity encoder provides well-disentangled identity features while keeping the benefits of multi-scale information which improves the diversity of camera poses. 2) Expression guidance disentangles face expressions from identities and improves the controllability of face expressions. 3) Class-guided denoising regularization encourages models to learn how faces should be denoised which boosts the text-alignment of backgrounds.

Recent methods attempt to enhance graph OOD generalization by generating flat environments. However such flat environments come with inherent limitations to capture more complex data distributions. Considering the DrugOOD dataset which contains diverse training environments (e.g. scaffold size etc.) flat contexts cannot sufficiently address its high heterogeneity. Thus a new challenge is posed to generate more semantically enriched environments to enhance graph invariant learning for handling distribution shifts. In this paper we propose a novel approach to generate hierarchical semantic environments for each graph. Firstly given an input graph we explicitly extract variant subgraphs from the input graph to generate proxy predictions on local environments. Then stochastic attention mechanisms are employed to re-extract the subgraphs for regenerating global environments in a hierarchical manner. In addition we introduce a new learning objective that guides our model to learn the diversity of environments within the same hierarchy while maintaining consistency across different hierarchies. This approach enables our model to consider the relationships between environments and facilitates robust graph invariant learning. Extensive experiments on real-world graph data have demonstrated the effectiveness of our framework.

To address this domain generalization is employed. Current methodologies in domain generalization for 3D human pose estimation typically utilize adversarial training to generate synthetic poses for training. Nonetheless these approaches exhibit several limitations. First the lack of prior information about the target domain complicates the application of suitable augmentation through a single pose augmentor affecting generalization on target domains. Moreover adversarial training's discriminator tends to enforce similarity between source and synthesized poses impeding the exploration of out-of-source distributions. Furthermore the pose estimator's optimization is not exposed to domain shifts limiting its overall generalization ability. To address these limitations we propose a novel framework featuring two pose augmentors: the weak and the strong augmentors. Our framework employs differential strategies for generation and discrimination processes facilitating the preservation of knowledge related to source poses and the exploration of out-of-source distributions without prior information about target poses. Besides we leverage meta-optimization to simulate domain shifts in the optimization process of the pose estimator thereby improving its generalization ability. Our proposed approach significantly outperforms existing methods as demonstrated through comprehensive experiments on various benchmark datasets."},

To fulfill this goal we first incorporate the ChatGPT-4 and an audio inpainting approach to construct the high-fidelity emotion transition human speeches. Considering obtaining the realistic 3D pose annotations corresponding to the dynamically inpainted emotion transition audio is extremely difficult we propose a novel weakly supervised training strategy to encourage authority gesture transitions.

In natural scenes MLLMs typically use low-resolution images leading to a substantial loss of visual information. Furthermore general-purpose MLLMs do not excel in handling document-oriented instructions. In this paper we propose a High-Resolution Visual Document Assistant (HRVDA) which bridges the gap between MLLMs and visual document understanding. This model employs a content filtering mechanism and an instruction filtering module to separately filter out the content-agnostic visual tokens and instruction-agnostic visual tokens thereby achieving efficient model training and inference for high-resolution images. In addition we construct a document-oriented visual instruction tuning dataset and apply a multi-stage training strategy to enhance the model's document modeling capabilities. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our model achieves state-of-the-art performance across multiple document understanding datasets while maintaining training efficiency and inference speed comparable to low-resolution models."},

This makes them inconsistent with human evaluation as human perception cares about both overall and detailed shape. In this paper we propose an analytic metric named Spectrum Area Under the Curve Difference (SAUCD) that demonstrates better consistency with human evaluation. To compare the difference between two shapes we first transform the 3D mesh to the spectrum domain using the discrete Laplace-Beltrami operator and Fourier transform. Then we calculate the Area Under the Curve (AUC) difference between the two spectrums so that each frequency band that captures either the overall or detailed shape is equitably considered. Taking human sensitivity across frequency bands into account we further extend our metric by learning suitable weights for each frequency band which better aligns with human perception. To measure the performance of SAUCD we build a 3D mesh evaluation dataset called Shape Grading along with manual annotations from more than 800 subjects. By measuring the correlation between our metric and human evaluation we demonstrate that SAUCD is well aligned with human evaluation and outperforms previous 3D mesh metrics."},

Our method named parametric-building-wireframe reconstruction (PBWR) takes aerial LiDAR point clouds and initial edge entities as input and fully uses the self-attention mechanism of transformers to regress edge parameters without any intermediate steps such as corner prediction. We propose an edge non-maximum suppression (E-NMS) module based on edge similarity to remove redundant edges. Additionally a dedicated edge loss function is utilized to guide the PBWR in regressing edges parameters when the simple use of the edge distance loss is not suitable. In our experiments our proposed method demonstrated state-of-the-art results on the Building3D dataset achieving an improvement of approximately 36% in Entry-level dataset edge accuracy and around a 42% improvement in the Tallinn dataset."},

In this paper we explore a more challenging yet label-efficient setting namely single point-supervised OOD and present our approach called Point2RBox. Specifically we propose to leverage two principles: 1) Synthetic pattern knowledge combination: By sampling around each labeled point on the image we spread the object feature to synthetic visual patterns with known boxes to provide the knowledge for box regression. 2) Transform self-supervision: With a transformed input image (e.g. scaled/rotated) the output RBoxes are trained to follow the same transformation so that the network can perceive the relative size/rotation between objects. The detector is further enhanced by a few devised techniques to cope with peripheral issues e.g. the anchor/layer assignment as the size of the object is not available in our point supervision setting. To our best knowledge Point2RBox is the first end-to-end solution for point-supervised OOD. In particular our method uses a lightweight paradigm yet it achieves a competitive performance among point-supervised alternatives 41.05%/27.62%/80.01% on DOTA/DIOR/HRSC datasets."},

Conventional methods model outdoor scenes with fine-grained 3D grids but the sparsity of non-empty voxels introduces considerable spatial redundancy leading to potential overfitting risks. In contrast our approach leverages the intrinsic low-rank property of 3D occupancy data factorizing voxel representations into low-rank components to efficiently mitigate spatial redundancy without sacrificing performance. Specifically we present the Vertical-Horizontal (VH) decomposition block factorizes 3D tensors into vertical vectors and horizontal matrices. With our \"decomposition-encoding-recovery\" framework we encode 3D contexts with only 1/2D convolutions and poolings and subsequently recover the encoded compact yet informative context features back to voxel representations.

At the same time there has been renewed interest in 3D scene representations such as neural radiance fields from multi-view images. However the availability of 3D or multiview data is still substantially limited compared to 2D image datasets making extending 2D vision models to 3D data highly desirable but also very challenging. Indeed extending a single 2D vision operator like scene editing to 3D typically requires a highly creative method specialized to that task and often requires per-scene optimization. In this paper we ask the question of whether any 2D vision model can be lifted to make 3D consistent predictions. We answer this question in the affirmative; our new Lift3D method trains to predict unseen views on feature spaces generated by a few visual models (i.e. DINO and CLIP) but then generalizes to novel vision operators and tasks such as style transfer super-resolution open vocabulary segmentation and image colorization; for some of these tasks there is no comparable previous 3D method. In many cases we even outperform state-of-the-art methods specialized for the task in question. Moreover Lift3D is a zero-shot method in the sense that it requires no task-specific training nor scene-specific optimization."},

Although yielding impressive results the impact of the language prior particularly in terms of generalization and robustness remains unexplored. In this paper we address this gap by quantifying the impact of this prior and introduce methods to benchmark its effectiveness across various settings. We generate \"low-level\" sentences that convey object-centric three-dimensional spatial relationships incorporate them as additional language priors and evaluate their downstream impact on depth estimation. Our key finding is that current language-guided depth estimators perform optimally only with scene-level descriptions and counter-intuitively fare worse with low level descriptions. Despite leveraging additional data these methods are not robust to directed adversarial attacks and decline in performance with an increase in distribution shift. Finally to provide a foundation for future research we identify points of failures and offer insights to better understand these shortcomings.

In this paper we tackle the challenge of open-set bias detection in text-to-image generative models presenting OpenBias a new pipeline that identifies and quantifies the severity of biases agnostically without access to any precompiled set. OpenBias has three stages. In the first phase we leverage a Large Language Model (LLM) to propose biases given a set of captions.

To create a lifelike avatar we draw upon two critical insights from a human perspective: 1) The connection between audio and the non-deterministic facial dynamics encompassing expressions blinks poses should exhibit synchronous and one-to-many mapping. 2) Vibrant expressions are often accompanied by emotion-aware high-definition (HD) textures and finely detailed teeth. However both aspects are frequently overlooked by existing methods. To this end this paper proposes using normalizing Flow and Vector-Quantization modeling to produce emotional talking faces that satisfy both insights concurrently (FlowVQTalker). Specifically we develop a flowbased coefficient generator that encodes the dynamics of facial emotion into a multi-emotion-class latent space represented as a mixture distribution. The generation process commences with random sampling from the modeled distribution guided by the accompanying audio enabling both lip-synchronization and the uncertain nonverbal facial cues generation. Furthermore our designed vector-quantization image generator treats the creation of expressive facial images as a code query task utilizing a learned codebook to provide rich high-quality textures that enhance the emotional perception of the results.

Given that knowledge learned from old classes is not fully transferable to new classes and that novel categories are fully unlabeled GCD inherently faces intractable problems including imbalanced classification performance and inconsistent confidence between old and new classes especially in the low-labeling regime. Hence some annotations of new classes are deemed necessary. However labeling new classes is extremely costly. To address this issue we take the spirit of active learning and propose a new setting called Active Generalized Category Discovery (AGCD). The goal is to improve the performance of GCD by actively selecting a limited amount of valuable samples for labeling from the oracle. To solve this problem we devise an adaptive sampling strategy which jointly considers novelty informativeness and diversity to adaptively select novel samples with proper uncertainty. However owing to the varied orderings of label indices caused by the clustering of novel classes the queried labels are not directly applicable to subsequent training. To overcome this issue we further propose a stable label mapping algorithm that transforms ground truth labels to the label space of the classifier thereby ensuring consistent training across different active selection stages.

This has motivated intensive research building convoluted prompt learning or feature adaptation strategies. In this work we propose and examine from convex-optimization perspectives a generalization of the standard LP baseline in which the linear classifier weights are learnable functions of the text embedding with class-wise multipliers blending image and text knowledge. As our objective function depends on two types of variables i.e. the class visual prototypes and the learnable blending parameters we propose a computationally efficient block coordinate Majorize-Minimize (MM) descent algorithm. In our full-batch MM optimizer which we coin LP++ step sizes are implicit unlike standard gradient descent practices where learning rates are intensively searched over validation sets. By examining the mathematical properties of our loss (e.g. Lipschitz gradient continuity) we build majorizing functions yielding data-driven learning rates and derive approximations of the loss's minima which provide data-informed initialization of the variables. Our image-language objective function along with these non-trivial optimization insights and ingredients yields surprisingly highly competitive few-shot CLIP performances. Furthermore LP++ operates in black-box relaxes intensive validation searches for the optimization hyper-parameters and runs orders-of-magnitudes faster than state-of-the-art few-shot CLIP adaptation methods.

Mask labels are labor-intensive which limits the number of categories in segmentation datasets. Consequently the vocabulary capacity of pre-trained VLMs is severely reduced after fine-tuning. However without fine-tuning VLMs trained under weak image-text supervision tend to make suboptimal mask predictions. To alleviate these issues we introduce a novel recurrent framework that progressively filters out irrelevant texts and enhances mask quality without training efforts. The recurrent unit is a two-stage segmenter built upon a frozen VLM. Thus our model retains the VLM's broad vocabulary space and equips it with segmentation ability. Experiments show that our method outperforms not only the training-free counterparts but also those fine-tuned with millions of data samples and sets the new state-of-the-art records for both zero-shot semantic and referring segmentation.

Unfortunately plug-and-play methods often show unstable behaviors hampering their promise of versatility and leading to suboptimal quality of reconstructed images. In this work we show that enforcing equivariance to certain groups of transformations (rotations reflections and/or translations) on the denoiser strongly improves the stability of the algorithm as well as its reconstruction quality. We provide a theoretical analysis that illustrates the role of equivariance on better performance and stability. We present a simple algorithm that enforces equivariance on any existing denoiser by simply applying a random transformation to the input of the denoiser and the inverse transformation to the output at each iteration of the algorithm. Experiments on multiple imaging modalities and denoising networks show that the equivariant plug-and-play algorithm improves both the reconstruction performance and the stability compared to their non-equivariant counterparts."},

In this paper we propose an innovative halftoning method termed \"neural dot-controllable halftoning\". This method allows dot-level image dithering by providing direct control over the motion of each ink dot. We conceptualize halftoning as the process of sprinkling dots on a canvas. Initially a specific quantity of dots are randomly dispersed on the canvas and subsequently adjusted based on the surrounding grayscale and gradient. To establish differentiable transformations between discrete ink dot positions and halftone matrices we devise a lightweight dot encoding network to spread dense gradients to sparse dots.

{"title": "Enhancing Multimodal Cooperation via Sample-level Modality Valuation", "authors": "Yake Wei, Ruoxuan Feng, Zihe Wang, Di Hu", "abstract": "One primary topic of multimodal learning is to jointly incorporate heterogeneous information from different modalities. However most models often suffer from unsatisfactory multimodal cooperation which cannot jointly utilize all modalities well. Some methods are proposed to identify and enhance the worse learnt modality but they are often hard to provide the fine-grained observation of multimodal cooperation at sample-level with theoretical support. Hence it is essential to reasonably observe and improve the fine-grained cooperation between modalities especially when facing realistic scenarios where the modality discrepancy could vary across different samples. To this end we introduce a sample-level modality valuation metric to evaluate the contribution of each modality for each sample. Via modality valuation we observe that modality discrepancy indeed could be different at sample-level beyond the global contribution discrepancy at dataset-level. We further analyze this issue and improve cooperation between modalities at sample-level by enhancing the discriminative ability of low-contributing modalities in a targeted manner. Overall our methods reasonably observe the fine-grained uni-modal contribution and achieve considerable improvement.

{"title": "One More Step: A Versatile Plug-and-Play Module for Rectifying Diffusion Schedule Flaws and Enhancing Low-Frequency Controls", "authors": "Minghui Hu, Jianbin Zheng, Chuanxia Zheng, Chaoyue Wang, Dacheng Tao, Tat-Jen Cham", "abstract": "It is well known that many open-released foundational diffusion models have difficulty in generating images that substantially depart from average brightness despite such images being present in the training data. This is due to an inconsistency: while denoising starts from pure Gaussian noise during inference the training noise schedule retains residual data even in the final timestep distribution due to difficulties in numerical conditioning in mainstream formulation leading to unintended bias during inference. To mitigate this issue certain eps-prediction models are combined with an ad-hoc offset-noise methodology. In parallel some contemporary models have adopted zero-terminal SNR noise schedules together with v-prediction which necessitate major alterations to pre-trained models. However such changes risk destabilizing a large multitude of community-driven applications anchored on these pre-trained models. In light of this our investigation revisits the fundamental causes leading to our proposal of an innovative and principled remedy called One More Step (OMS). By integrating a compact network and incorporating an additional simple yet effective step during inference OMS elevates image fidelity and harmonizes the dichotomy between training and inference while preserving original model parameters. Once trained various pre-trained diffusion models with the same latent domain can share the same OMS module."},

However we contend that such implicit high-dimensional structure modeling approch inadequately represents the local geometric structure of point clouds due to the absence of explicit structural information. Hence we introduce X-3D an explicit 3D structure modeling approach. X-3D functions by capturing the explicit local structural information within the input 3D space and employing it to produce dynamic kernels with shared weights for all neighborhood points within the current local region. This modeling approach introduces effective geometric prior and significantly diminishes the disparity between the local structure of the embedding space and the original input point cloud thereby improving the extraction of local features. Experiments show that our method can be used on a variety of methods and achieves state-of-the-art performance on segmentation classification detection tasks with lower extra computational cost.

Using such poisoned ML models as the foundation to build real-world systems can compromise application safety. Hence there is a critical need for algorithms that detect whether a given target model has been poisoned. This work proposes a novel approach for detecting poisoned models called Attack To Defend (A2D) which is based on the observation that poisoned models are more sensitive to adversarial perturbations compared to benign models. We propose a metric called sensitivity to adversarial perturbations (SAP) to measure the sensitivity of a ML model to adversarial attacks at a specific perturbation bound. We then generate strong adversarial attacks against an unrelated reference model and estimate the SAP value of the target model by transferring the generated attacks. The target model is deemed to be a trojan if its SAP value exceeds a decision threshold. The A2D framework requires only black-box access to the target model and a small clean set while being computationally efficient. The A2D approach has been evaluated on four standard image datasets and its effectiveness under various types of poisoning attacks has been demonstrated"},

Relying on learning the joint representation of seen compositions these methods ignore the explicit modeling of the state and object thus limiting the exploitation of pre-trained knowledge and generalization to unseen compositions. With a particular focus on the universality of the solution in this work we propose a novel paradigm for CZSL models that establishes three identification branches (i.e. Multi-Path) to jointly model the state object and composition. The presented Troika is an outstanding implementation that aligns the branch-specific prompt representations with decomposed visual features. To calibrate the bias between semantically similar multi-modal representations we further devise a Cross-Modal Traction module into Troika that shifts the prompt representation towards the current visual content. We conduct extensive experiments on three popular benchmarks where our method significantly outperforms existing methods in both closed-world and open-world settings.

While these approaches admit the computation of globally optimal solutions in polynomial time their natural generalisation to 3D shape matching is widely known to be intractable. In this work we address this issue by proposing a novel path-based formalism for 3D shape matching. More specifically we consider an alternative shape discretisation in which one of the 3D shapes (the source shape) is represented as a SpiderCurve i.e. a long self-intersecting curve that traces the 3D shape surface. We then tackle the 3D shape matching problem as finding a shortest path in the product graph of the SpiderCurve and the target 3D shape. Our approach introduces a set of novel constraints that ensure a globally geometrically consistent matching. Overall our formalism leads to an integer linear programming problem for which we experimentally show that it can efficiently be solved to global optimality. We demonstrate that our approach is competitive with recent state-of-the-art shape matching methods while in addition guaranteeing geometric consistency."},
{"title": "Style Blind Domain Generalized Semantic Segmentation via Covariance Alignment and Semantic Consistence Contrastive Learning", "authors": "Woo-Jin Ahn, Geun-Yeong Yang, Hyun-Duck Choi, Myo-Taeg Lim", "abstract": "Deep learning models for semantic segmentation often experience performance degradation when deployed to unseen target domains unidentified during the training phase. This is mainly due to variations in image texture (i.e. style) from different data sources. To tackle this challenge existing domain generalized semantic segmentation (DGSS) methods attempt to remove style variations from the feature. However these approaches struggle with the entanglement of style and content which may lead to the unintentional removal of crucial content information causing performance degradation. This study addresses this limitation by proposing BlindNet a novel DGSS approach that blinds the style without external modules or datasets. The main idea behind our proposed approach is to alleviate the effect of style in the encoder whilst facilitating robust segmentation in the decoder. To achieve this BlindNet comprises two key components: covariance alignment and semantic consistency contrastive learning. Specifically the covariance alignment trains the encoder to uniformly recognize various styles and preserve the content information of the feature rather than removing the style-sensitive factor. Meanwhile semantic consistency contrastive learning enables the decoder to construct discriminative class embedding space and disentangles features that are vulnerable to misclassification. Through extensive experiments our approach outperforms existing DGSS methods exhibiting robustness and superior performance for semantic segmentation on unseen target domains."},
{"title": "Rolling Shutter Correction with Intermediate Distortion Flow Estimation", "authors": "Mingdeng Cao, Sidi Yang, Yujiu Yang, Yinqiang Zheng", "abstract": "This paper proposes to correct the rolling shutter (RS) distorted images by estimating the distortion flow from the global shutter (GS) to RS directly. Existing methods usually perform correction using the undistortion flow from the RS to GS. They initially predict the flow from consecutive RS frames subsequently rescaling it as the displacement fields from the RS frame to the underlying GS image using time-dependent scaling factors. Following this RS-aware forward warping is employed to convert the RS image into its GS counterpart. Nevertheless this strategy is prone to two shortcomings. First the undistortion flow estimation is rendered inaccurate by merely linear scaling the flow due to the complex non-linear motion nature. Second RS-aware forward warping often results in unavoidable artifacts. To address these limitations we introduce a new framework that directly estimates the distortion flow and rectifies the RS image with the backward warping operation. More specifically we first propose a global correlation-based flow attention mechanism to estimate the initial distortion flow and GS feature jointly which are then refined by the following coarse-to-fine decoder layers. Additionally a multi-distortion flow prediction strategy is integrated to mitigate the issue of inaccurate flow estimation further. Experimental results validate the effectiveness of the proposed method which outperforms state-of-the-art approaches on various benchmarks while maintaining high efficiency.

However in contrast to classical discrete digital signal processing the portfolio of tools to process such representations is still severely limited and restricted to Euclidean domains. In this paper we address this problem by showing how a probabilistic re-interpretation of neural fields can enable their training and inference processes to become \"filter-aware\". The formulation we propose not only merges training and filtering in an efficient way but also generalizes beyond the familiar Euclidean coordinate spaces to the more general set of smooth manifolds and convolutions induced by the actions of Lie groups. We demonstrate how this framework can enable novel integrations of signal processing techniques for neural field applications on both Euclidean domains such as images and audio as well as non-Euclidean domains such as rotations and rays. A noteworthy benefit of our method is its applicability. Our method can be summarized as primarily a modification of the loss function and in most cases does not require changes to the network architecture or the inference process."},

Recent attempts address this problem relying on 3D geometry priors (e.g. shapes sizes and positions) learned from multi-view images. However such methods encounter the following limitations: 1) they require a set of multi-view images as training data for a specific scene (e.g. face car or chair) which is often unavailable in many real-world scenarios; 2) they fail to extract the geometry priors from single-view images due to the lack of multi-view supervision. In this paper we propose a Geometry-enhanced NeRF (G-NeRF) which seeks to enhance the geometry priors by a geometry-guided multi-view synthesis approach followed by a depth-aware training. In the synthesis process inspired that existing 3D GAN models can unconditionally synthesize high-fidelity multi-view images we seek to adopt off-the-shelf 3D GAN models such as EG3D as a free source to provide geometry priors through synthesizing multi-view data. Simultaneously to further improve the geometry quality of the synthetic data we introduce a truncation method to effectively sample latent codes within 3D GAN models. To tackle the absence of multi-view supervision for single-view images we design the depth-aware training approach incorporating a depth-aware discriminator to guide geometry priors through depth maps. Experiments demonstrate the effectiveness of our method in terms of both qualitative and quantitative results."},

Existing token pruning research for compressing VLTs mainly follows a single-modality-based scheme yet ignores the critical role of aligning different modalities for guiding the token pruning process causing the important tokens for one modality to be falsely pruned in another modality branch. Meanwhile existing VLT pruning works also lack the flexibility to dynamically compress each layer based on different input samples. To this end we propose a novel framework named Multimodal Alignment-Guided Dynamic Token Pruning (MADTP) for accelerating various VLTs. Specifically we first introduce a well-designed Multi-modality Alignment Guidance (MAG) module that can align features of the same semantic concept from different modalities to ensure the pruned tokens are less important for all modalities. We further design a novel Dynamic Token Pruning (DTP) module which can adaptively adjust the token compression ratio in each layer based on different input instances. Extensive experiments on various benchmarks demonstrate that MADTP significantly reduces the computational complexity of kinds of multimodal models while preserving competitive performance. Notably when applied to the BLIP model in the NLVR2 dataset MADTP can reduce the GFLOPs by 80% with less than 4% performance degradation."},
{"title": "ICP-Flow: LiDAR Scene Flow Estimation with ICP", "authors": "Yancong Lin, Holger Caesar", "abstract": "Scene flow characterizes the 3D motion between two LiDAR scans captured by an autonomous vehicle at nearby timesteps. Prevalent methods consider scene flow as point-wise unconstrained flow vectors that can be learned by either large-scale training beforehand or time-consuming optimization at inference. However these methods do not take into account that objects in autonomous driving often move rigidly. We incorporate this rigid-motion assumption into our design where the goal is to associate objects over scans and then estimate the locally rigid transformations. We propose ICP-Flow a learning-free flow estimator. The core of our design is the conventional Iterative Closest Point (ICP) algorithm which aligns the objects over time and outputs the corresponding rigid transformations. Crucially to aid ICP we propose a histogram-based initialization that discovers the most likely translation thus providing a good starting point for ICP. The complete scene flow is then recovered from the rigid transformations. We outperform state-of-the-art baselines including supervised models on the Waymo dataset and perform competitively on Argoverse-v2 and nuScenes. Further we train a feedforward neural network supervised by the pseudo labels from our model and achieve top performance among all models capable of real-time inference. We validate the advantage of our model on scene flow estimation with longer temporal gaps up to 0.4 seconds where other models fail to deliver meaningful results."},

Kolekar", "abstract": "Transformer-based models have revolutionized the field of image super-resolution (SR) by harnessing their inherent ability to capture complex contextual features. The overlapping rectangular shifted window technique used in transformer architecture nowadays is a common practice in super-resolution models to improve the quality and robustness of image upscaling. However it suffers from distortion at the boundaries and has limited unique shifting modes. To overcome these weaknesses we propose a non-overlapping triangular window technique that synchronously works with the rectangular one to mitigate boundary-level distortion and allows the model to access more unique sifting modes. In this paper we propose a Composite Fusion Attention Transformer (CFAT) that incorporates triangular-rectangular window-based local attention with a channel-based global attention technique in image super-resolution. As a result CFAT enables attention mechanisms to be activated on more image pixels and captures long-range multi-scale features to improve SR performance. The extensive experimental results and ablation study demonstrate the effectiveness of CFAT in the SR domain. Our proposed model shows a significant 0.7 dB performance improvement over other state-of-the-art SR architectures."},

Meanwhile the concept of mixed-precision quantization (MPQ) where different layers of a deep learning model are assigned varying bit-width remains unexplored in the FL settings. We present a novel FL algorithm FedMPQ which introduces mixed-precision quantization to resource-heterogeneous FL systems. Specifically local models quantized so as to satisfy bit-width constraint are trained by optimizing an objective function that includes a regularization term which promotes reduction of precision in some of the layers without significant performance degradation. The server collects local model updates de-quantizes them into full-precision models and then aggregates them into a global model. To initialize the next round of local training the server relies on the information learned in the previous training round to customize bit-width assignments of the models delivered to different clients. In extensive benchmarking experiments on several model architectures and different datasets in both iid and non-iid settings FedMPQ outperformed the baseline FL schemes that utilize fixed-precision quantization while incurring only a minor computational overhead on the participating devices."},

However in most of prevailing approaches the suboptimal teacher models and insufficient student architecture investigations limit the performance gains. To address these issues we propose a simple yet effective Category-aware Knowledge Distillation and Pruning (CaKDP) framework for compressing 3D detectors. Firstly CaKDP transfers the knowledge of two-stage detector to one-stage student one mitigating the impact of inadequate teacher models. To bridge the gap between the heterogeneous detectors we investigate their differences and then introduce the student-motivated category-aware KD to align the category prediction between distillation pairs. Secondly we propose a category-aware pruning scheme to obtain the customizable architecture of compact student model. The method calculates the category prediction gap before and after removing each filter to evaluate the importance of filters and retains the important filters. Finally to further improve the student performance a modified IOU-aware refinement module with negligible computations is leveraged to remove the redundant false positive predictions. Experiments demonstrate that CaKDP achieves the compact detector with high performance. For example on WOD CaKDP accelerates CenterPoint by half while boosting L2 mAPH by 1.61%.

Most memory-based approaches used in OTFCL are not suitable for unsupervised learning because they require accessing supervised signals to implement their sample selection mechanisms. In this study we address this issue by proposing a novel memory management approach namely the Dynamic Cluster Memory (DCM) which builds new memory clusters to capture distribution shifts over time without accessing any supervised signals. DCM introduces a novel memory expansion mechanism based on the knowledge discrepancy criterion which evaluates the novelty of the incoming data as the signal for the memory expansion ensuring a compact memory capacity. We also propose a new sample selection approach that automatically stores incoming data samples with similar semantic information in the same memory cluster while also facilitating the knowledge diversity among memory clusters. Furthermore a novel memory pruning approach is proposed to automatically remove overlapping memory clusters through a graph relation evaluation ensuring a fixed memory capacity while maintaining the diversity among the samples stored in the memory.

MAS works by simultaneously denoising multiple 2D motion sequences representing different views of the same 3D motion. It ensures consistency across all views at each diffusion step by combining the individual generations into a unified 3D sequence and projecting it back to the original views. We demonstrate MAS on 2D pose data acquired from videos depicting professional basketball maneuvers rhythmic gymnastic performances featuring a ball apparatus and horse races.

Traditional human-machine interaction tasks often require machines to simply help without nuanced consideration of human abilities and feelings such as their opportunity for practice and learning sense of self-improvement and self-esteem. Addressing this gap we define a pivotal and novel challenge Smart Help which aims to provide proactive yet adaptive support to human agents with diverse disabilities and dynamic goals in various tasks and environments. To establish this challenge we leverage AI2-THOR to build a new interactive 3D realistic household environment for the Smart Help task. We introduce an innovative opponent modeling module that provides a nuanced understanding of the main agent's capabilities and goals in order to optimize the assisting agent's helping policy. Rigorous experiments validate the efficacy of our model components and show the superiority of our holistic approach against established baselines. Our findings illustrate the potential of AI-imbued assistive robots in improving the well-being of vulnerable groups."},

However most existing works focus solely on the direct generation ignoring the editing restricting them from synthesizing customized 3D faces through iterative adjustments. In this paper we propose a unified text-guided framework from face generation to editing. In the generation stage we propose a geometry-texture decoupled generation to mitigate the loss of geometric details caused by coupling. Besides decoupling enables us to utilize the generated geometry as a condition for texture generation yielding highly geometry-texture aligned results. We further employ a fine-tuned texture diffusion model to enhance texture quality in both RGB and YUV space. In the editing stage we first employ a pre-trained diffusion model to update facial geometry or texture based on the texts. To enable sequential editing we introduce a UV domain consistency preservation regularization preventing unintentional changes to irrelevant facial attributes. Besides we propose a self-guided consistency weight strategy to improve editing efficacy while preserving consistency. Through comprehensive experiments we showcase our method's superiority in face synthesis."},

However when trained on sparse inputs NeRF typically encounters issues of incorrect density or color predictions mainly due to insufficient coverage of the scene causing partial and sparse supervision thus leading to significant performance degradation. While existing works mainly consider ray-level consistency to construct 2D learning regularization based on rendered color depth or semantics on image planes in this paper we propose a novel approach that models 3D spatial field consistency to improve NeRF's performance with sparse inputs. Specifically we first adopt a voxel-based ray sampling strategy to ensure that the sampled rays intersect with a certain voxel in 3D space. We then randomly sample additional points within the voxel and apply a Transformer to infer the properties of other points on each ray which are then incorporated into the volume rendering. By backpropagating through the rendering loss we enhance the consistency among neighboring points. Additionally we propose to use a contrastive loss on the encoder output of the Transformer to further improve consistency within each voxel. Experiments demonstrate that our method yields significant improvement over different radiance fields in the sparse inputs setting and achieves comparable performance with current works.

To handle this issue previous efforts have been made towards leveraging learned priors or introducing additional regularizations. In contrast in this paper we for the first time provide an orthogonal method from the perspective of network structure. Given the observation that trivially reducing the number of model parameters alleviates the overfitting issue but at the cost of missing details we propose the multi-input MLP (mi-MLP) that incorporates the inputs (i.e. location and viewing direction) of the vanilla MLP into each layer to prevent the overfitting issue without harming detailed synthesis. To further reduce the artifacts we propose to model colors and volume density separately and present two regularization terms. Extensive experiments on multiple datasets demonstrate that: 1) although the proposed mi-MLP is easy to implement it is surprisingly effective as it boosts the PSNR of the baseline from 14.73 to 24.23. 2) the overall framework achieves state-of-the-art results on a wide range of benchmarks.

Our approach comprises two key components: reference matching and video dehazing. Firstly we introduce a non-aligned reference frame matching module leveraging an adaptive sliding window to match high-quality reference frames from clear videos. Video dehazing incorporates flow-guided cosine attention sampler and deformable cosine attention fusion modules to enhance spatial multiframe alignment and fuse their improved information.

Unfortunately due to their variable structure and scarcity of vector training data directly applying diffusion models on this domain remains a challenging problem. Using workarounds like optimization via Score Distillation Sampling (SDS) is also fraught with difficulty as vector representations are non-trivial to directly optimize and tend to result in implausible geometries such as redundant or self-intersecting shapes. NIVeL addresses these challenges by reinterpreting the problem on an alternative intermediate domain which preserves the desirable properties of vector graphics - mainly sparsity of representation and resolution-independence. This alternative domain is based on neural implicit fields expressed in a set of decomposable editable layers. Based on our experiments NIVeL produces text-to-vector graphics results of significantly better quality than the state-of-the-art."},

As the internet witnesses an increasing influx of AI-generated images concerns arise regarding inherent biases that may accompany them potentially leading to the dissemination of harmful content. This paper explores whether a detrimental feedback loop resulting in bias amplification would occur if generated images were used as the training data for future models. We conduct simulations by progressively substituting original images in COCO and CC3M datasets with images generated through Stable Diffusion. The modified datasets are used to train OpenCLIP and image captioning models which we evaluate in terms of quality and bias. Contrary to expectations our findings indicate that introducing generated images during training does not uniformly amplify bias. Instead instances of bias mitigation across specific tasks are observed. We further explore the factors that may influence these phenomena such as artifacts in image generation (e.g. blurry faces) or pre-existing biases in the original datasets."},

Although conics are more informative features than points the loss of the conic property under distortion has critically limited the utility of conic features in camera calibration. Many existing approaches addressed conic-based calibration by ignoring distortion or introducing 3D spherical targets to circumvent this limitation. In this paper we present a novel formulation for conic-based calibration using moments. Our derivation is based on the mathematical finding that the first moment can be estimated without bias even under distortion. This allows us to track moment changes during projection and distortion ensuring the preservation of the first moment of the distorted conic. With an unbiased estimator the circular patterns can be accurately detected at the sub-pixel level and can now be fully exploited for an entire calibration pipeline resulting in significantly improved calibration.

This process involves searching latent variables from a well-trained StyleGAN generator that can synthesize a real image modifying these latent variables and then synthesizing an image with the desired edits. A balance must be struck between the quality of the reconstruction and the ability to edit. Earlier studies utilized the low-dimensional W-space for latent search which facilitated effective editing but struggled with reconstructing intricate details. More recent research has turned to the high-dimensional feature space F which successfully inverses the input image but loses much of the detail during editing. In this paper we introduce StyleFeatureEditor -- a novel method that enables editing in both w-latents and F-latents. This technique not only allows for the reconstruction of finer image details but also ensures their preservation during editing.

We address the interplay between the two modalities in long videos by explicitly modelling the temporal extents of audio and visual events. We propose the Time Interval Machine (TIM) where a modality-specific time interval poses as a query to a transformer encoder that ingests a long video input. The encoder then attends to the specified interval as well as the surrounding context in both modalities in order to recognise the ongoing action. We test TIM on three long audio-visual video datasets: EPIC-KITCHENS Perception Test and AVE reporting state-of-the-art (SOTA) for recognition. On EPIC-KITCHENS we beat previous SOTA that utilises LLMs and significantly larger pre-training by 2.9% top-1 action recognition accuracy.

Nevertheless it is not widely explored to utilize human-object contact information for the joint reconstruction of 3D human and object from a single image. In this work we present a novel joint 3D human-object reconstruction method (CONTHO) that effectively exploits contact information between humans and objects. There are two core designs in our system: 1) 3D-guided contact estimation and 2) contact-based 3D human and object refinement. First for accurate human-object contact estimation CONTHO initially reconstructs 3D humans and objects and utilizes them as explicit 3D guidance for contact estimation. Second to refine the initial reconstructions of 3D human and object we propose a novel contact-based refinement Transformer that effectively aggregates human features and object features based on the estimated human-object contact. The proposed contact-based refinement prevents the learning of erroneous correlation between human and object which enables accurate 3D reconstruction.

We address this problem in the scenario where we have access to images from the target domains but no annotations. Motivated by the challenges of the OOD-CV benchmark where we encounter real world Out-of-Domain (OOD) nuisances and occlusion we introduce a novel Bayesian approach to OOD robustness for object classification. Our work extends Compositional Neural Networks (CompNets) which have been shown to be robust to occlusion but degrade badly when tested on OOD data. We exploit the fact that CompNets contain a generative head defined over feature vectors represented by von Mises-Fisher (vMF) kernels which correspond roughly to object parts and can be learned without supervision. We obverse that some vMF kernels are similar between different domains while others are not. This enables us to learn a transitional dictionary of vMF kernels that are intermediate between the source and target domains and train the generative model on this dictionary using the annotations on the source domain followed by iterative refinement. This approach termed Unsupervised Generative Transition (UGT) performs very well in OOD scenarios even when occlusion is present. UGT is evaluated on different OOD benchmarks including the OOD-CV dataset several popular datasets (e.g. ImageNet-C artificial image corruptions (including adding occluders) and synthetic-to-real domain transfer and does well in all scenarios outperforming SOTA alternatives."},

Despite its high rendering quality and speed at high resolutions they both deteriorate drastically when rendered at lower resolutions or from far away camera position. During low resolution or far away rendering the pixel size of the image can fall below the Nyquist frequency compared to the screen size of each splatted 3D Gaussian and leads to aliasing effect. The rendering is also drastically slowed down by the sequential alpha blending of more splatted Gaussians per pixel. To address these issues we propose a multi-scale 3D Gaussian splatting algorithm which maintains Gaussians at different scales to represent the same scene. Higher-resolution images are rendered with more small Gaussians and lower-resolution images are rendered with fewer larger Gaussians. With similar training time our algorithm can achieve 13%-66% PSNR and 160%-2400% rendering speed improvement at 4x-128x scale rendering on Mip-NeRF360 dataset compared to the single scale 3D Gaussian splatting."},

We demonstrate that classes are not equal and unfairness is prevalent for image classification models across various datasets network architectures and model capacities. Moreover several intriguing properties of fairness are identified. First the unfairness lies in problematic representation rather than classifier bias distinguished from long-tailed recognition. Second with the proposed concept of Model Prediction Bias we investigate the origins of problematic representation during training optimization. Our findings reveal that models tend to exhibit greater prediction biases for classes that are more challenging to recognize. It means that more other classes will be confused with harder classes. Then the False Positives (FPs) will dominate the learning in optimization thus leading to their poor accuracy. Further we conclude that data augmentation and representation learning algorithms improve overall performance by promoting fairness to some degree in image classification."},

Different from conventional vision-language tasks VDU is specifically concerned with text-rich scenarios containing abundant document elements. Nevertheless the importance of fine-grained features remains largely unexplored within the community of LVLMs leading to suboptimal performance in text-rich scenarios. In this paper we abbreviate it as the fine-grained feature collapse issue. With the aim of filling this gap we propose a contrastive learning framework termed Document Object COntrastive learning (DoCo) specifically tailored for the downstream tasks of VDU. DoCo leverages an auxiliary multimodal encoder to obtain the features of document objects and align them to the visual features generated by the vision encoder of LVLM which enhances visual representation in text-rich scenarios. It can represent that the contrastive learning between the visual holistic representations and the multimodal fine-grained features of document objects can assist the vision encoder in acquiring more effective visual cues thereby enhancing the comprehension of text-rich documents in LVLMs. We also demonstrate that the proposed DoCo serves as a plug-and-play pre-training method which can be employed in the pre-training of various LVLMs without inducing any increase in computational complexity during the inference process. Extensive experimental results on multiple benchmarks of VDU reveal that LVLMs equipped with our proposed DoCo can achieve superior performance and mitigate the gap between VDU and generic vision-language tasks."},

SCoCo includes two novel modules: (1) a global background adaptation (GBA) module with a scene-level contrastive loss to extract salient regions from the scene by searching the adaptive \"saliency threshold\" in the self-supervised transformer features and (2) a locality-aware similarity (LAS) module with an instance-level contrastive loss to group salient regions into instances by modeling the in-region saliency coherence and cross-region saliency contrasts. Extensive experiments show that SCoCo outperforms state-of-the-art weakly-supervised SID methods and carefully designed unsupervised baselines and has comparable performances to fully-supervised SID methods."},

We then lift these vertices to 3D yielding a low-poly body mesh ('MeshPose'). Our system is trained in an end-to-end manner and is the first HMR method to attain competitive DensePose accuracy while also being lightweight and amenable to efficient inference making it suitable for real-time AR applications."},

Especially the rampant misuse of prediction APIs to replicate models without access to the original data or architecture poses grave security threats. Diverse defense strategies have emerged to address these vulnerabilities yet these defenses either incur heavy inference overheads or assume idealized attack scenarios. To address these challenges we revisit the utilization of noise transition matrix as an efficient perturbation technique which injects noise into predicted posteriors in a linear manner and integrates seamlessly into existing systems with minimal overhead for model stealing defense. Provably with such perturbed posteriors the attacker's cloning process degrades into learning from noisy data. Toward optimizing the noise transition matrix we proposed a novel bi-level optimization training framework which performs fidelity on the victim model while the surrogate model adversarially. Comprehensive experimental results demonstrate that our method effectively thwarts model stealing attacks and achieves minimal utility trade-offs outperforming existing state-of-the-art defenses."},
{"title": "Generative Region-Language Pretraining for Open-Ended Object Detection", "authors": "Chuang Lin, Yi Jiang, Lizhen Qu, Zehuan Yuan, Jianfei Cai", "abstract": "In recent research significant attention has been devoted to the open-vocabulary object detection task aiming to generalize beyond the limited number of classes labeled during training and detect objects described by arbitrary category names at inference. Compared with conventional object detection open vocabulary object detection largely extends the object detection categories. However it relies on calculating the similarity between image regions and a set of arbitrary category names with a pretrained vision-and-language model. This implies that despite its open-set nature the task still needs the predefined object categories during the inference stage. This raises the question: What if we do not have exact knowledge of object categories during inference? In this paper we call such a new setting as generative open-ended object detection which is a more general and practical problem. To address it we formulate object detection as a generative problem and propose a simple framework named GenerateU which can detect dense objects and generate their names in a free-form way. Particularly we employ Deformable DETR as a region proposal generator with a language model translating visual regions to object names. To assess the free-form object detection task we introduce an evaluation method designed to quantitatively measure the performance of generative outcomes. Extensive experiments demonstrate strong zero-shot detection performance of our GenerateU. For example on the LVIS dataset our GenerateU achieves comparable results to the open-vocabulary object detection method GLIP even though the category names are not seen by GenerateU during inference.

Determining suitable quantization parameters such as scaling factors and weight rounding is the primary strategy for mitigating the impact of quantization noise (calibration) and restoring the performance of the quantized models. However the existing activation calibration methods have never considered information degradation between pre- (FP) and post-quantized activations. In this study we introduce a well-defined distributional metric from information theory mutual information into PTQ calibration. We aim to calibrate the quantized activations by maximizing the mutual information between the pre- and post-quantized activations. To realize this goal we establish a contrastive learning (CL) framework for the PTQ calibration where the quantization parameters are optimized through a self-supervised proxy task. Specifically by leveraging CL during the PTQ process we can benefit from pulling the positive pairs of quantized and FP activations collected from the same input samples while pushing negative pairs from different samples. Thanks to the ingeniously designed critic function we avoid the unwanted but often-encountered collision solution in CL especially in calibration scenarios where the amount of calibration data is limited. Additionally we provide a theoretical guarantee that minimizing our designed loss is equivalent to maximizing the desired mutual information. Consequently the quantized activations retain more information which ultimately enhances the performance of the quantized network. Experimental results show that our method can effectively serve as an add-on module to existing SoTA PTQ methods."},

Meanwhile diffusion models have shown appealing performance in generating high-quality images from random noise with high indeterminacy through step-by-step denoising. Inspired by their denoising capability we propose a novel diffusion-based framework (6D-Diff) to handle the noise and indeterminacy in object pose estimation for better performance. In our framework to establish accurate 2D-3D correspondence we formulate 2D keypoints detection as a reverse diffusion (denoising) process. To facilitate such a denoising process we design a Mixture-of-Cauchy-based forward diffusion process and condition the reverse process on the object appearance features. Extensive experiments on the LM-O and YCB-V datasets demonstrate the effectiveness of our framework."},

However despite the performance gains contributed by large vision and language pre-training we find that state-of-the-art VLMs struggle with compositional reasoning on grounding tasks. To demonstrate this we propose Attribute Relation and Priority grounding (ARPGrounding) benchmark to test VLMs' compositional reasoning ability on visual grounding tasks. ARPGrounding contains 11425 samples and evaluates the compositional understanding of VLMs in three dimensions: 1) attribute denoting comprehension of objects' properties; 2) relation indicating an understanding of relation between objects; 3) priority reflecting an awareness of the part of speech associated with nouns. Using the ARPGrounding benchmark we evaluate several mainstream VLMs. We empirically find that these models perform quite well on conventional visual grounding datasets achieving performance comparable to or surpassing state-of-the-art methods but showing strong deficiencies in compositional reasoning. Furthermore we propose a composition-aware fine-tuning pipeline demonstrating the potential to leverage cost-effective image-text annotations for enhancing the compositional understanding of VLMs in grounding tasks."},

Nonetheless existing approaches encounter a significant challenge when attempting to generate samples from random noise inputs which inherently lack meaningful information. Consequently these models struggle to effectively map this noise to the ground-truth sample distribution resulting in prolonging training times and low-quality outputs. In this paper we propose a novel Noisy Layer Generation method (NAYER) which relocates the random source from the input to a noisy layer and utilizes the meaningful constant label-text embedding (LTE) as the input. LTE is generated by using the language model once and then it is stored in memory for all subsequent training processes. The significance of LTE lies in its ability to contain substantial meaningful inter-class information enabling the generation of high-quality samples with only a few training steps. Simultaneously the noisy layer plays a key role in addressing the issue of diversity in sample generation by preventing the model from overemphasizing the constrained label information. By reinitializing the noisy layer in each iteration we aim to facilitate the generation of diverse samples while still retaining the method's efficiency thanks to the ease of learning provided by LTE. Experiments carried out on multiple datasets demonstrate that our NAYER not only outperforms the state-of-the-art methods but also achieves speeds 5 to 15 times faster than previous approaches.

Portrait style transfer and 3D recovery from monocular images as two representative tasks have so far evolved independently. In this paper we make a connection between the two and tackle the challenging task of 3D portrait stylization - modeling high-fidelity 3D stylized avatars from captured 2D portrait images. However naively combining the techniques from the two isolated areas may suffer from either inadequate stylization or absence of 3D assets. To this end we propose 3DToonify a new framework that introduces a progressive training scheme to achieve 3D style adaption on spatial neural representation (SNR). SNR is constructed with implicit fields and they are dynamically optimized by the progressive training scheme which consists of three stages: guided prior learning deformable geometry adaption and explicit texture adaption. In this way stylized geometry and texture are learned in SNR in an explicit and structured way with only a single stylized exemplar needed. Moreover our method obtains style-adaptive underlying structures (i.e. deformable geometry and exaggerated texture) and view-consistent stylized avatar rendering from arbitrary novel viewpoints. Both qualitative and quantitative experiments have been conducted to demonstrate the effectiveness and superiority of our method for automatically generating exemplar-guided 3D stylized avatars."},

However for videos such paired data is not as abundant. Therefore video-VLMs are usually designed by adapting pretrained image-VLMs to the video-domain instead of training from scratch. All such recipes rely on augmenting visual embeddings with temporal information (i.e. image --> video) often keeping text embeddings unchanged or even being discarded. In this paper we argue the contrary that better video-VLMs can be designed by focusing more on augmenting text rather than visual information. More specifically we introduce Video-conditioned Text Representations (VicTR): a form of text embeddings optimized w.r.t. visual embeddings creating a more-flexible contrastive latent space. Our model can further make use of freely-available semantic information in the form of visually-grounded auxiliary text (e.g. object or scene information).

Liu, Robert Wolfe, Aylin Caliskan, Bill Howe", "abstract": "Deep neural networks are prone to capture correlations between spurious attributes and class labels leading to low accuracy on some combinations of class labels and spurious attribute values. When a spurious attribute represents a protected class these low-accuracy groups can manifest discriminatory bias. Existing methods attempting to improve worst-group accuracy assume the training data validation data or both are reliably labeled by the spurious attribute. But a model may be perceived to be biased towards a concept that is not represented by pre-existing labels on the training data. In these situations the spurious attribute must be defined with external information. We propose Concept Correction a framework that represents a concept as a curated set of images from any source then labels each training sample by its similarity to the concept set to control spurious correlations. For example concept sets representing gender can be used to measure and control gender bias even without explicit labels. We demonstrate and evaluate an instance of the framework as Concept DRO which uses concept sets to estimate group labels then uses these labels to train with a state of the art distributively robust optimization objective. We show that Concept DRO outperforms existing methods that do not require labels of spurious attributes by up to 33.1% on three image classification datasets and is competitive with the best methods that assume access to labels. We consider how the size and quality of the concept set influences performance and find that even smaller manually curated sets of noisy AI-generated images are effective at controlling spurious correlations suggesting that high-quality reusable concept sets are easy to create and effective in reducing bias."},

Existing certified defenses are mostly designed for unimodal models which achieve sub-optimal certified robustness guarantees when extended to multi-modal models as shown in our experimental results. In our work we propose MMCert the first certified defense against adversarial attacks to a multi-modal model. We derive a lower bound on the performance of our MMCert under arbitrary adversarial attacks with bounded perturbations to both modalities (e.g. in the context of auto-driving we bound the number of changed pixels in both RGB image and depth image). We evaluate our MMCert using two benchmark datasets: one for the multi-modal road segmentation task and the other for the multi-modal emotion recognition task.

More specifically to handle repeated actions we propose a multi-neighbor cycle consistency and a multi-cycle-back regression loss by finding multiple soft nearest neighbors using a Gaussian Mixture Model. To handle background and redundant frames we introduce a context-dependent drop function in our framework discouraging the alignment of droppable frames. On the other hand to learn from videos of multiple activities jointly we propose a multi-head crosstask network allowing us to embed a video and estimate progress without knowing its activity label.

However it may require a large number of Gaussians which creates a substantial memory footprint. This paper introduces GES (Generalized Exponential Splatting) a novel representation that employs Generalized Exponential Function (GEF) to model 3D scenes requiring far fewer particles to represent a scene and thus significantly outperforming Gaussian Splatting methods in efficiency with a plug-and-play replacement ability for Gaussian-based utilities. GES is validated theoretically and empirically in both principled 1D setup and realistic 3D scenes. It is shown to represent signals with sharp edges more accurately which are typically challenging for Gaussians due to their inherent low-pass characteristics. Our empirical analysis demonstrates that GEF outperforms Gaussians in fitting natural-occurring signals (E.g. squares triangles parabolic signals) thereby reducing the need for extensive splitting operations that increase the memory footprint of Gaussian Splatting. With the aid of a frequency-modulated loss GES achieves competitive performance in novel-view synthesis benchmarks while requiring less than half the memory storage of Gaussian Splatting and increasing the rendering speed by up to 39%.

To avoid the central failure and communication bottleneck in the server-based FL we concentrate on the Decentralized Personalized Federated Learning (DPFL) that performs distributed model training in a Peer-to-Peer (P2P) manner. Most personalized works in DPFL are based on undirected and symmetric topologies however the data computation and communication resources heterogeneity result in large variances in the personalized models which lead the undirected aggregation to suboptimal personalized performance and unguaranteed convergence. To address these issues we propose a directed collaboration DPFL framework by incorporating stochastic gradient push and partial model personalized called Decentralized Federated Partial Gradient Push (DFedPGP). It personalizes the linear classifier in the modern deep model to customize the local solution and learns a consensus representation in a fully decentralized manner. Clients only share gradients with a subset of neighbors based on the directed and asymmetric topologies which guarantees flexible choices for resource efficiency and better convergence. Theoretically we show that the proposed DFedPGP achieves a superior convergence rate of O(1/?T) in the general non-convex setting and tighter connectivity among clients will speed up the convergence.

On the one hand the generation process based on pure vector domain completely ignores the similarity measurement between shape parameter (and their combination) and the paired pixel image appearance pattern; on the other hand two-stage methods (i.e. generation-and-vectorization) based on pixel diffusion followed by differentiable image-to-vector translation suffer from wrong error-correction signal caused by approximate gradients. To address the above issues we propose a novel generation framework based on dual-domain (vector-pixel) diffusion with cross-modality impulse signals from each other. First in each diffusion step the current representation extracted from the other domain is used as a condition variable to constrain the subsequent sampling operation yielding shape-aware new parameterizations; second independent supervision signals from both domains avoid the gradient error accumulation problem caused by cross-domain representation conversion.

The main open issues of related work include limited interactivity a lack of support for local edits and large memory requirements rendering them less useful in practice. We address these limitations with LAENeRF a unified framework for photorealistic and non-photorealistic appearance editing of NeRFs. To tackle local editing we leverage a voxel grid as starting point for region selection. We learn a mapping from expected ray terminations to final output color which can optionally be supervised by a style loss resulting in a framework which can perform photorealistic and non-photorealistic appearance editing of selected regions. Relying on a single point per ray for our mapping we limit memory requirements and enable fast optimization. To guarantee interactivity we compose the output color using a set of learned modifiable base colors composed with additive layer mixing.

Simultaneously our two estimators recover the rotation and remove fisheye distortion by remapping from a general scene image. Without considering vanishing-point constraints we find that additional points for learning-based methods can be defined.

Computational methods can simulate bokeh effects without relying on a physical camera lens but the inaccurate lens modeling in existing filtering-based methods leads to artifacts that need post-processing or learning-based methods to fix. We propose Dr.Bokeh a novel rendering method that addresses the issue by directly correcting the defect that violates the physics in the current filtering-based bokeh rendering equation. Dr.Bokeh first preprocesses the input RGBD to obtain a layered scene representation. Dr.Bokeh then takes the layered representation and user-defined lens parameters to render photo-realistic lens blur based on the novel occlusion-aware bokeh rendering method. Experiments show that the non-learning based renderer Dr.Bokeh outperforms state-of-the-art bokeh rendering algorithms in terms of photo-realism. In addition extensive quantitative and qualitative evaluations show the more accurate lens model further pushes the limit of a closely related field depth-from-defocus."},
{"title": "Boosting Order-Preserving and Transferability for Neural Architecture Search: a Joint Architecture Refined Search and Fine-tuning Approach", "authors": "Beichen Zhang, Xiaoxing Wang, Xiaohan Qin, Junchi Yan", "abstract": "Supernet is a core component in many recent Neural Architecture Search (NAS) methods. It not only helps embody the search space but also provides a (relative) estimation of the final performance of candidate architectures. Thus it is critical that the top architectures ranked by a supernet should be consistent with those ranked by true performance which is known as the order-preserving ability. In this work we analyze the order-preserving ability on the whole search space (global) and a sub-space of top architectures (local) and empirically show that the local order-preserving for current two-stage NAS methods still need to be improved. To rectify this we propose a novel concept of Supernet Shifting a refined search strategy combining architecture searching with supernet fine-tuning. Specifically apart from evaluating the training loss is also accumulated in searching and the supernet is updated every iteration. Since superior architectures are sampled more frequently in evolutionary searching the supernet is encouraged to focus on top architectures thus improving local order-preserving. Besides a pre-trained supernet is often un-reusable for one-shot methods. We show that Supernet Shifting can fulfill transferring supernet to a new dataset. Specifically the last classifier layer will be unset and trained through evolutionary searching. Comprehensive experiments show that our method has better order-preserving ability and can find a dominating architecture. Moreover the pre-trained supernet can be easily transferred into a new dataset with no loss of performance."},
{"title": "Multiscale Vision Transformers Meet Bipartite Matching for Efficient Single-stage Action Localization", "authors": "Ioanna Ntinou, Enrique Sanchez, Georgios Tzimiropoulos", "abstract": "Action Localization is a challenging problem that combines detection and recognition tasks which are often addressed separately. State-of-the-art methods rely on off-the-shelf bounding box detections pre-computed at high resolution and propose transformer models that focus on the classification task alone. Such two-stage solutions are prohibitive for real-time deployment. On the other hand single-stage methods target both tasks by devoting part of the network (generally the backbone) to sharing the majority of the workload compromising performance for speed. These methods build on adding a DETR head with learnable queries that after cross- and self-attention can be sent to corresponding MLPs for detecting a person's bounding box and action. However DETR-like architectures are challenging to train and can incur in big complexity. In this paper we observe that a straight bipartite matching loss can be applied to the output tokens of a vision transformer. This results in a backbone + MLP architecture that can do both tasks without the need of an extra encoder-decoder head and learnable queries. We show that a single MViTv2-S architecture trained with bipartite matching to perform both tasks surpasses the same MViTv2-S when trained with RoI align on pre-computed bounding boxes. With a careful design of token pooling and the proposed training pipeline our Bipartite-Matching Vision Transformer model BMViT achieves +3 mAP on AVA2.2. w.r.t. the two-stage MViTv2-S counterpart.

Despite notable progress in video deblurring works it is still a challenging problem because of the loss of motion information during the duration of the exposure time. Since event cameras can capture clear motion information asynchronously with high temporal resolution several works exploit the event camera for deblurring as they can provide abundant motion information. However despite these approaches there were few cases of actively exploiting the long-range temporal dependency of videos. To tackle these deficiencies we present an event-based video deblurring framework by actively utilizing temporal information from videos. To be specific we first introduce a frequency-based cross-modal feature enhancement module. Second we propose event-guided video alignment modules by considering the valuable characteristics of the event and videos. In addition we designed a hybrid camera system to collect the first real-world event-based video deblurring dataset. For the first time we build a dataset containing synchronized high-resolution real-world blurred videos and corresponding sharp videos and event streams.

Recent years have witnessed numerous explorations in the field where 2D cameras and 3D LiDARs are mostly employed. Despite their admirable performance they may encounter challenges in adverse weather such as rain and fog. Hopefully 4D millimeter-wave Radar emerges as a promising alternative as its longer wavelength makes it virtually immune to interference from tiny particles of fog and rain. Therefore in this work we propose a novel 4D Radar place recognition model TransLoc4D based on sparse convolution and Transformer structures. Specifically a Minkloc4D backbone is first proposed to leverage the geometric intensity and velocity information from 4D Radar scans. While mainstream 3D LiDAR solutions merely capture geometric structures of point clouds Minkloc4D explores the intensity and velocity properties of 4D Radar scans and demonstrates their effectiveness. After feature extraction a Transformer layer is introduced to enhance local features where linear self-attention captures the long-range dependency of point cloud alleviating its sparsity and noise. To validate TransLoc4D we construct two datasets and set up benchmarks for 4D radar place recognition. Experiments show TransLoc4D is feasible and can robustly deal with dynamic and adverse environments."},

In this work we introduce ModaVerse a Multi-modal Large Language Model (MLLM) capable of comprehending and transforming content across various modalities including images videos and audio. Predominant MLLM frameworks have largely relied on aligning latent spaces of textual and non-textual features. This alignment process which synchronizes a language model trained on textual data with encoders and decoders trained on multi-modal data often necessitates extensive training of several projection layers in multiple stages. Inspired by LLM-as-agent methodologies we propose a novel Input/Output (I/O) alignment mechanism that operates directly at the level of natural language. It aligns the LLM's output with the input of generative models avoiding the complexities associated with latent feature alignments and simplifying the multiple training stages of existing MLLMs into a single efficient process. By conducting experiments on several benchmarks we demonstrate that our approach attains comparable performance with the state of the art while achieving considerable efficiencies in data usage."},

In this work we introduce a novel learnable mesh representation through a set of local 3D sample Points and their associated Normals and Quadric error metrics (QEM) w.r.t. the underlying shape which we denote PoNQ. A global mesh is directly derived from PoNQ by efficiently leveraging the knowledge of the local quadric errors. Besides marking the first use of QEM within a neural shape representation our contribution guarantees both topological and geometrical properties by ensuring that a PoNQ mesh does not self-intersect and is always the boundary of a volume. Notably our representation does not rely on a regular grid is supervised directly by the target surface alone and also handles open surfaces with boundaries and/or sharp features. We demonstrate the efficacy of PoNQ through a learning-based mesh prediction from SDF grids and show that our method surpasses recent state-of-the-art techniques in terms of both surface and edge-based metrics."},

Identification-based methods have been widely explored to tackle label ambiguity issues in PLL which regard the true label as a latent variable to be identified. However identifying the true labels accurately and completely remains challenging causing noise in pseudo labels during model training. In this paper we propose a new method called CroSel which leverages historical predictions from the model to identify true labels for most training examples. First we introduce a cross selection strategy which enables two deep models to select true labels of partially labeled data for each other. Besides we propose a novel consistency regularization term called co-mix to avoid sample waste and tiny noise caused by false selection. In this way CroSel can pick out the true labels of most examples with high precision. Extensive experiments demonstrate the superiority of CroSel which consistently outperforms previous state-of-the-art methods on benchmark datasets. Additionally our method achieves over 90% accuracy and quantity for selecting true labels on CIFAR-type datasets under various settings."},

However most approaches primarily operate in the raw pixel space of images which limits the exploration of the frequency characteristics of underwater images leading to an inadequate utilization of deep models' representational capabilities in producing high-quality images. In this paper we introduce a novel Underwater Image Enhancement (UIE) framework named WF-Diff designed to fully leverage the characteristics of frequency domain information and diffusion models. WF-Diff consists of two detachable networks: Wavelet-based Fourier information interaction network (WFI2-net) and Frequency Residual Diffusion Adjustment Module (FRDAM). With our full exploration of the frequency domain information WFI2-net aims to achieve preliminary enhancement of frequency information in the wavelet space. Our proposed FRDAM can further refine the high- and low-frequency information of the initial enhanced images which can be viewed as a plug-and-play universal module to adjust the detail of the underwater images. With the above techniques our algorithm can show SOTA performance on real-world underwater image datasets and achieves competitive performance in visual quality."},

However traditional VLMs trained through contrastive learning on limited and noisy image-text pairs often lack the spatial and linguistic understanding to generalize well to dense vision tasks or less common languages. Our approach Solid Foundation CLIP (SF-CLIP) circumvents this issue by implicitly building on the solid visual and language understanding of foundational models trained on vast amounts of unimodal data. SF-CLIP integrates contrastive image-text pretraining with a masked knowledge distillation from large foundational text and vision models. This methodology guides our VLM in developing robust text and image representations. As a result SF-CLIP shows exceptional zero-shot classification accuracy and enhanced image and text retrieval capabilities setting a new state of the art for ViT-B/16 trained on YFCC15M and CC12M. Moreover the dense per-patch supervision enhances our zero-shot and linear probe performance in semantic segmentation tasks. A remarkable aspect of our model is its multilingual proficiency evidenced by strong retrieval results in multiple languages despite being trained predominantly on English data. We achieve all of these improvements without sacrificing the training efficiency through our selective application of masked distillation and the inheritance of teacher word embeddings."},

Although such depthwise operator only consumes a few FLOPs it largely harms the model efficiency on powerful computing devices due to the high memory access costs. For example ConvNeXt-T has similar FLOPs with ResNet-50 but only achieves  60% throughputs when trained on A100 GPUs with full precision. Although reducing the kernel size of ConvNeXt can improve speed it results in significant performance degradation which poses a challenging problem: How to speed up large-kernel-based CNN models while preserving their performance. To tackle this issue inspired by Inceptions we propose to decompose large-kernel depthwise convolution into four parallel branches along channel dimension i.e. small square kernel two orthogonal band kernels and an identity mapping. With this new Inception depthwise convolution we build a series of networks namely IncepitonNeXt which not only enjoy high throughputs but also maintain competitive performance. For instance InceptionNeXt-T achieves 1.6x higher training throughputs than ConvNeX-T as well as attains 0.2% top-1 accuracy improvement on ImageNet-1K.

This typically involves digital painters using a paint bucket tool to manually color each segment enclosed by lines based on RGB values predetermined by a color designer. This frame-by-frame process is both arduous and time-intensive. Current automated methods mainly focus on segment matching. This technique migrates colors from a reference to the target frame by aligning features within line-enclosed segments across frames. However issues like occlusion and wrinkles in animations often disrupt these direct correspondences leading to mismatches. In this work we introduce a new learning-based inclusion matching pipeline which directs the network to comprehend the inclusion relationships between segments rather than relying solely on direct visual correspondences. Our method features a two-stage pipeline that integrates a coarse color warping module with an inclusion matching module enabling more nuanced and accurate colorization.

In this paper inspired by pretrained language models we find that these language models have actually pretrained a superior codebook via a large number of text corpus but such information is rarely exploited in VQIM. To this end we propose a novel codebook transfer framework with part-of-speech called VQCT which aims to transfer a well-trained codebook from pretrained language models to VQIM for robust codebook learning.

A generalizable face landmarker is required in practice because real-world facial images e.g. the avatars in animations and games are often stylized in various ways. However achieving generalizable face landmarking is challenging due to the diversity of facial styles and the scarcity of labeled stylized faces. In this study we propose a simple but effective paradigm to learn a generalizable face landmarker based on labeled real human faces and unlabeled stylized faces. Our method learns the face landmarker as the key module of a conditional face warper. Given a pair of real and stylized facial images the conditional face warper predicts a warping field from the real face to the stylized one in which the face landmarker predicts the ending points of the warping field and provides us with high-quality pseudo landmarks for the corresponding stylized facial images.

Different scene text tasks need different information but previous representation learning methods use tightly coupled features for all tasks resulting in sub-optimal performance. We propose a Disentangled Representation Learning framework (DARLING) aimed at disentangling these two types of features for improved adaptability in better addressing various downstream tasks (choose what you really need). Specifically we synthesize a dataset of image pairs with identical style but different content. Based on the dataset we decouple the two types of features by the supervision design. Clearly we directly split the visual representation into style and content features the content features are supervised by a text recognition loss while an alignment loss aligns the style features in the image pairs. Then style features are employed in reconstructing the counterpart image via an image decoder with a prompt that indicates the counterpart's content. Such an operation effectively decouples the features based on their distinctive properties. To the best of our knowledge this is the first time in the field of scene text that disentangles the inherent properties of the text images. Our method achieves state-of-the-art performance in Scene Text Recognition Removal and Editing."},

These challenges stem primarily from (i) the absence of powerful generative models capable of jointly modeling natural language 3D scenes and human motion and (ii) the generative models' intensive data requirements contrasted with the scarcity of comprehensive high-quality language-scene-motion datasets. To tackle these issues we introduce a novel two-stage framework that employs scene affordance as an intermediate representation effectively linking 3D scene grounding and conditional motion generation. Our framework comprises an Affordance Diffusion Model (ADM) for predicting explicit affordance map and an Affordance-to-Motion Diffusion Model (AMDM) for generating plausible human motions. By leveraging scene affordance maps our method overcomes the difficulty in generating human motion under multimodal condition signals especially when training with limited data lacking extensive language-scene-motion pairs. Our extensive experiments demonstrate that our approach consistently outperforms all baselines on established benchmarks including HumanML3D and HUMANISE. Additionally we validate our model's exceptional generalization capabilities on a specially curated evaluation set featuring previously unseen descriptions and scenes."},

Based on our analysis and observations we propose a novel method for zero-shot semantic segmentation dubbed CLIP-RC (CLIP with Regional Clues) bringing two main insights. On the one hand a region-level bridge is necessary to provide fine-grained semantics. On the other hand overfitting should be mitigated during the training stage. Benefiting from the above discoveries CLIP-RC achieves state-of-the-art performance on various zero-shot semantic segmentation benchmarks including PASCAL VOC PASCAL Context and COCO-Stuff 164K.

The inherent variability in brain function between individuals leads existing literature to focus on acquiring separate models for each individual using their respective brain signal data ignoring commonalities between these data. In this article we devise Psychometry an omnifit model for reconstructing images from functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging (fMRI) obtained from different subjects. Psychometry incorporates an omni mixture-of-experts (Omni MoE) module where all the experts work together to capture the inter-subject commonalities while each expert associated with subject-specific parameters copes with the individual differences. Moreover Psychometry is equipped with a retrieval-enhanced inference strategy termed Ecphory which aims to enhance the learned fMRI representation via retrieving from prestored subject-specific memories. These designs collectively render Psychometry omnifit and efficient enabling it to capture both inter-subject commonality and individual specificity across subjects. As a result the enhanced fMRI representations serve as conditional signals to guide a generation model to reconstruct high-quality and realistic images establishing Psychometry as state-of-the-art in terms of both high-level and low-level metrics."},

By designing a partitioning approach based on the visible part of the scene for each sensor we formulate the calibration problem using only the overlapping areas. This strategy results in a more robust and accurate calibration that is less prone to failure.

Understanding the influence of individual training data sources on predictions made by these models is crucial for improving their trustworthiness. Current influence estimation techniques involve computing gradients for every training point or repeated training on different subsets. These approaches face obvious computational challenges when scaled up to large datasets and models. In this paper we introduce and explore the Mirrored Influence Hypothesis highlighting a reciprocal nature of influence between training and test data. Specifically it suggests that evaluating the influence of training data on test predictions can be reformulated as an equivalent yet inverse problem: assessing how the predictions for training samples would be altered if the model were trained on specific test samples. Through both empirical and theoretical validations we demonstrate the wide applicability of our hypothesis. Inspired by this we introduce a new method for estimating the influence of training data which requires calculating gradients for specific test samples paired with a forward pass for each training point. This approach can capitalize on the common asymmetry in scenarios where the number of test samples under concurrent examination is much smaller than the scale of the training dataset thus gaining a significant improvement in efficiency compared to existing approaches. We demonstrate the applicability of our method across a range of scenarios including data attribution in diffusion models data leakage detection analysis of memorization mislabeled data detection and tracing behavior in language models."},

The existing works treat them as off-the-shelf feature extractors for each short-trimmed snippet without capturing the fine-grained relation among different snippets in a broader temporal context. To mitigate this issue this paper focuses on designing a new mechanism for adapting these pre-trained ViT models as a unified long-form video transformer to fully unleash its modeling power in capturing inter-snippet relation while still keeping low computation overhead and memory consumption for efficient TAD. To this end we design effective cross-snippet propagation modules to gradually exchange short-term video information among different snippets from two levels. For inner-backbone information propagation we introduce a cross-snippet propagation strategy to enable multi-snippet temporal feature interaction inside the backbone. For post-backbone information propagation we propose temporal transformer layers for further clip-level modeling.

However capturing RAW video is challenging due to limitations in bandwidth and storage. Various methods have been proposed to address similar issues in single image RAW capture through de-rendering. These methods utilize both the metadata and the sRGB image to perform sRGB-to-RAW de-rendering and recover high-quality single-frame RAW data. However metadata-based methods always require additional computation for online metadata generation imposing severe burden on mobile camera device for high frame rate RAW video capture. To address this issue we propose a framework that utilizes frame affinity to achieve high-quality sRGB-to-RAW video reconstruction. Our approach consists of two main steps. The first step temporal affinity prior extraction uses motion information between adjacent frames to obtain a reference RAW image. The second step spatial feature fusion and mapping learns a pixel-level mapping function using scene-specific and position-specific features provided by the previous frame. Our method can be easily applied to current mobile camera equipment without complicated adaptations or added burden.

Inspired by clustering-based segmentation techniques S2VNet makes full use of the slice-wise structure of volumetric data by initializing cluster centers from the cluster results of previous slice. This enables knowledge acquired from prior slices to assist in the segmentation of the current slice further efficiently bridging the communication between remote slices using mere 2D networks. Moreover such a framework readily accommodates inter- active segmentation with no architectural change simply by initializing centroids from user inputs. S2VNet distinguishes itself by swift inference speeds and reduced memory consumption compared to prevailing 3D solutions. It can also handle multi-class interactions with each of them serving to initialize different centroids. Experiments on three benchmarks demonstrate S2VNet surpasses task-specified solutions on both automatic/interactive setups."},

However their large model sizes hinder their utilization on platforms with limited computational resources. We find that directly using smaller pre-trained models and applying magnitude-based pruning on CLIP models leads to inflexibility and inferior performance. Recent efforts for VLP compression either adopt uni-modal compression metrics resulting in limited performance or involve costly mask-search processes with learnable masks. In this paper we first propose the Module-wise Pruning Error (MoPE) metric accurately assessing CLIP module importance by performance decline on cross-modal tasks. Using the MoPE metric we introduce a unified pruning framework applicable to both pre-training and task-specific fine-tuning compression stages. For pre-training MoPE-CLIP effectively leverages knowledge from the teacher model significantly reducing pre-training costs while maintaining strong zero-shot capabilities. For fine-tuning consecutive pruning from width to depth yields highly competitive task-specific models.

CPD first constructs Commonsense Prototype (CProto) characterized by high-quality bounding box and dense points based on commonsense intuition. Subsequently CPD refines the low-quality pseudo-labels by leveraging the size prior from CProto.

To this end we complement the commonly used identity feature with detail features which are carefully designed to maintain appearance details yet allow versatile local variations(e.g. lighting orientation posture etc.) supporting the object in favorably blending with different surroundings. We further propose to borrow knowledge from video datasets where we can observe various forms (i.e. along the time axis) of a single object leading to stronger model generalizability and robustness.

One pivotal issue at the heart of this endeavor is the precise alignment and calibration of embeddings derived from event-centric data such that they harmoniously coincide with those originating from RGB imagery. Capitalizing on the vast repositories of datasets with paired events and RGB images our proposition is to harness and extrapolate the profound knowledge encapsulated within the pre-trained SAM framework. As a cornerstone to achieving this we introduce a multi-scale feature distillation methodology. This methodology rigorously optimizes the alignment of token embeddings originating from event data with their RGB image counterparts thereby preserving and enhancing the robustness of the overall architecture. Considering the distinct significance that token embeddings from intermediate layers hold for higher-level embeddings our strategy is centered on accurately calibrating the pivotal token embeddings. This targeted calibration is aimed at effectively managing the discrepancies in high-level embeddings originating from both the event and image domains.

Due to different settings on whether prompts exist they either suffer from weakness in instance completeness or region details. Also when dealing with different scenarios directly switching between the two matting models introduces inconvenience and higher workload. Therefore we wonder whether we can alleviate the limitations of both settings while achieving unification to facilitate more convenient use. Our key idea is to offer saliency guidance for automatic mode to enable its attention to detailed regions and also refine the instance completeness in interactive mode by replacing the binary mask guidance with a more probabilistic form. With different guidance for each mode we can achieve unification through adaptable guidance defined as saliency information in automatic mode and user cue for interactive one. It is instantiated as candidate feature in our method an automatic switch for class token in pretrained ViTs and average feature of user prompts controlled by the existence of user prompts. Then we use the candidate feature to generate a probabilistic similarity map as the guidance to alleviate the over-reliance on binary mask.

This quantization process significantly reduces the memory requirements and computational complexity of the network. Binary Neural Networks (BNNs) are the extreme quantization case representing values with just one bit.

Thus the mismatch between the forward and backward models corrupts the direction of the gradient causing training inconsistency problems and performance degradation. In contrast to current BNN approaches we propose to employ a binary periodic (BiPer) function during binarization. Specifically we use a square wave for the forward pass to obtain the binary values and employ the trigonometric sine function with the same period of the square wave as a differentiable surrogate during the backward pass. We demonstrate that this approach can control the quantization error by using the frequency of the periodic function and improves network performance. Extensive experiments validate the effectiveness of BiPer in benchmark datasets and network architectures with improvements of up to 1% and 0.69% with respect to state-of-the-art methods in the classification task over CIFAR-10 and ImageNet respectively.

However attributed to the frequent coupling of co-occurring objects and the limited supervision from image-level labels the challenging co-occurrence problem is widely present and leads to false activation of objects in WSSS. In this work we devise a 'Separate and Conquer' scheme SeCo to tackle this issue from dimensions of image space and feature space. In the image space we propose to 'separate' the co-occurring objects with image decomposition by subdividing images into patches. Importantly we assign each patch a category tag from Class Activation Maps (CAMs) which spatially helps remove the co-context bias and guide the subsequent representation. In the feature space we propose to 'conquer' the false activation by enhancing semantic representation with multi-granularity knowledge contrast.

Reduced density can be detrimental to navigation under several scenarios. We observe that despite high sparsity in most cases the global topology of LiDAR outlining the static structures can be inferred. We utilize this property to obtain a backbone skeleton of a LiDAR scan in the form of a single connected component that is a proxy to its global topology. We utilize the backbone to augment new points along static structures to overcome sparsity. Newly introduced points could correspond to existing static structures or to static points that were earlier obstructed by dynamic objects. To the best of our knowledge we are the first to use such a strategy for sparse LiDAR point clouds. Existing solutions close to our approach fail to identify and preserve the global static LiDAR topology and generate sub-optimal points. We propose GLiDR a Graph Generative network that is topologically regularized using 0-dimensional Persistent Homology (PH) constraints. This enables GLiDR to introduce newer static points along a topologically consistent global static LiDAR backbone. GLiDR generates precise static points using 32x sparser dynamic scans and performs better than the baselines across three datasets.

Furthermore they often neglect the potential of harnessing complementary information between views and labels thus constraining their classification capabilities. To address these challenges we propose a view-category interactive sharing transformer tailored for incomplete multi-view multi-label learning. Within this network we incorporate a two-layer transformer module to characterize the interplay between views and labels. Additionally to address view incompleteness a KNN-style missing view generation module is employed.

Most existing datasets are captured in constrained scenarios and lack samples of such complex movements. For this reason we propose a data collection pipeline comprising automatic crawling precise annotation and hardcase mining. Based on this pipeline we establish a large dataset in a short time. The dataset named HardMo contains 7M images along with precise annotations covering 15 categories of dance and 14 categories of martial arts. Empirically we find that the prediction failure in dance and martial arts is mainly characterized by the misalignment of hand-wrist and foot-ankle. To dig deeper into the two hardcases we leverage the proposed automatic pipeline to filter collected data and construct two subsets named HardMo-Hand and HardMo-Foot.

FSCIL encounters two significant challenges: catastrophic forgetting and overfitting and these challenges have driven prior studies to primarily rely on shallow models such as ResNet-18. Even though their limited capacity can mitigate both forgetting and overfitting issues it leads to inadequate knowledge transfer during few-shot incremental sessions.

However the hallucinations inherent in machine-generated data which could lead to hallucinatory outputs in MLLMs remain under-explored. This work aims to investigate various hallucinations (i.e. object relation attribute hallucinations) and mitigate those hallucinatory toxicities in large-scale machine-generated visual instruction datasets. Drawing on the human ability to identify factual errors we present a novel hallucination detection and elimination framework HalluciDoctor based on the cross-checking paradigm. We use our framework to identify and eliminate hallucinations in the training data automatically. Interestingly HalluciDoctor also indicates that spurious correlations arising from long-tail object co-occurrences contribute to hallucinations. Based on that we execute counterfactual visual instruction expansion to balance data distribution thereby enhancing MLLMs' resistance to hallucinations. Comprehensive experiments on hallucination evaluation benchmarks show that our method successfully mitigates 44.6% hallucinations relatively and maintains competitive performance compared to LLaVA.

However the process of personalization presents inherent challenges in terms of time and memory requirements. Fine-tuning each personalized model needs considerable GPU time investment and storing a personalized model per subject can be demanding in terms of storage capacity. To overcome these challenges we propose HyperDreamBooth - a hypernetwork capable of efficiently generating a small set of personalized weights from a single image of a person. By composing these weights into the diffusion model coupled with fast finetuning HyperDreamBooth can generate a person's face in various contexts and styles with high subject details while also preserving the model's crucial knowledge of diverse styles and semantic modifications. Our method achieves personalization on faces in roughly 20 seconds 25x faster than DreamBooth and 125x faster than Textual Inversion using as few as one reference image with the same quality and style diversity as DreamBooth.

Using fewer projection views to reconstruct CT also known as sparse-view reconstruction can reduce ionizing radiation and further benefit interventional radiology. Compared with sparse-view reconstruction for traditional parallel/fan-beam CT CBCT reconstruction is more challenging due to the increased dimensionality caused by the measurement process based on cone-shaped X-ray beams. As a 2D-to-3D reconstruction problem although implicit neural representations have been introduced to enable efficient training only local features are considered and different views are processed equally in previous works resulting in spatial inconsistency and poor performance on complicated anatomies. To this end we propose C^2RV by leveraging explicit multi-scale volumetric representations to enable cross-regional learning in the 3D space. Additionally the scale-view cross-attention module is introduced to adaptively aggregate multi-scale and multi-view features.

To address this issue this paper proposes a new framework to enhance the fine-grained image understanding abilities of MLLMs. Specifically we present a new method for constructing the instruction tuning dataset at a low cost by leveraging annotations in existing datasets. A self-consistent bootstrapping method is also introduced to extend existing dense object annotations into high-quality referring-expression-bounding-box pairs. These methods enable the generation of high-quality instruction data which includes a wide range of fundamental abilities essential for fine-grained image perception.

However current TTA methods fail to address the fundamental issue: covariate shift i.e. the decreased generalizability can be attributed to the model's reliance on the marginal distribution of the training data which may impair model calibration and introduce confirmation bias. To address this we propose a novel energy-based perspective enhancing the model's perception of target data distributions without requiring access to training data or processes. Building on this perspective we introduce Test-time Energy Adaptation (TEA) which transforms the trained classifier into an energy-based model and aligns the model's distribution with the test data's enhancing its ability to perceive test distributions and thus improving overall generalizability. Extensive experiments across multiple tasks benchmarks and architectures demonstrate TEA's superior generalization performance against state-of-the-art methods.

However current implicit function-based methods inevitably produce artifacts while existing deformation methods are difficult to reconstruct high-fidelity humans wearing loose clothing. In this paper we propose a two-stage deformation method named Vertex Shift (VS) for reconstructing clothed 3D humans from single images. Specifically VS first stretches the estimated SMPL-X mesh into a coarse 3D human model using shift fields inferred from normal maps then refines the coarse 3D human model into a detailed 3D human model via a graph convolutional network embedded with implicit-function-learned features. This \"stretch-refine\" strategy addresses large deformations required for reconstructing loose clothing and delicate deformations for recovering intricate and detailed surfaces achieving high-fidelity reconstructions that faithfully convey the pose clothing and surface details from the input images. The graph convolutional network's ability to exploit neighborhood vertices coupled with the advantages inherited from the deformation methods ensure VS rarely produces artifacts like distortions and non-human shapes and never produces artifacts like holes broken parts and dismembered limbs. As a result VS can reconstruct high-fidelity and artifact-less clothed 3D humans from single images even under scenarios of challenging poses and loose clothing. Experimental results on three benchmarks and two in-the-wild datasets demonstrate that VS significantly outperforms current state-of-the-art methods.

However the challenge persists in developing a unified framework that could effectively handle varying multimodal data including RGB infrared sketches and textual information. Additionally the emergence of large-scale models shows promising performance in various vision tasks but the foundation model in ReID is still blank. In response to these challenges a novel multimodal learning paradigm for ReID is introduced referred to as All-in-One (AIO) which harnesses a frozen pre-trained big model as an encoder enabling effective multimodal retrieval without additional fine-tuning. The diverse multimodal data in AIO are seamlessly tokenized into a unified space allowing the modality-shared frozen encoder to extract identity-consistent features comprehensively across all modalities. Furthermore a meticulously crafted ensemble of cross-modality heads is designed to guide the learning trajectory. AIO is the first framework to perform all-in-one ReID encompassing four commonly used modalities. Experiments on cross-modal and multimodal ReID reveal that AIO not only adeptly handles various modal data but also excels in challenging contexts showcasing exceptional performance in zero-shot and domain generalization scenarios.

Existing route planning approaches can be categorized into two main classes: traditional autoregressive and diffusion-based methods. The former often fails due to its myopic nature while the latter either assumes full observability or struggles to adapt to unfamiliar scenarios due to strong couplings with behavior cloning from experts. To address these deficiencies we propose a versatile diffusion-based approach for both 2D and 3D route planning under partial observability. Specifically our value-guided diffusion policy first generates plans to predict actions across various timesteps providing ample foresight to the planning. It then employs a differentiable planner with state estimations to derive a value function directing the agent's exploration and goal-seeking behaviors without seeking experts while explicitly addressing partial observability. During inference our policy is further enhanced by a best-plan-selection strategy substantially boosting the planning success rate. Moreover we propose projecting point clouds derived from RGB-D inputs onto 2D grid-based bird-eye-view maps via semantic segmentation generalizing to 3D environments. This simple yet effective adaption enables zero-shot transfer from 2D-trained policy to 3D cutting across the laborious training for 3D policy and thus certifying our versatility. Experimental results demonstrate our superior performance particularly in navigating situations beyond expert demonstrations surpassing state-of-the-art autoregressive and diffusion-based baselines for both 2D and 3D scenarios."},

As the name implies LeftRefill horizontally stitches reference and target views together as a whole input. The reference image occupies the left side while the target canvas is positioned on the right. Then LeftRefill paints the right-side target canvas based on the left-side reference and specific task instructions. Such a task formulation shares some similarities with contextual inpainting akin to the actions of a human painter. This novel formulation efficiently learns both structural and textured correspondence between reference and target without other image encoders or adapters. We inject task and view information through cross-attention modules in T2I models and further exhibit multi-view reference ability via the re-arranged self-attention modules. These enable LeftRefill to perform consistent generation as a generalized model without requiring test-time fine-tuning or model modifications. Thus LeftRefill can be seen as a simple yet unified framework to address reference-guided synthesis.

The residual-based approach then directly enables application of our proposed sampling technique which applies the learned residuals only in areas where the concept is localized via cross-attention and applies the original diffusion weights in all other regions. Localized sampling therefore combines the learned identity of the concept with the existing generative prior of the underlying diffusion model. We show that personalized residuals effectively capture the identity of a concept in  3 minutes on a single GPU without the use of regularization images and with fewer parameters than previous models and localized sampling allows using the original model as strong prior for large parts of the image."},

Kim", "abstract": "Visual Relationship Detection (VRD) has seen significant advancements with Transformer-based architectures recently. However we identify two key limitations in a conventional label assignment for training Transformer-based VRD models which is a process of mapping a ground-truth (GT) to a prediction. Under the conventional assignment an 'unspecialized' query is trained since a query is expected to detect every relation which makes it difficult for a query to specialize in specific relations. Furthermore a query is also insufficiently trained since a GT is assigned only to a single prediction therefore near-correct or even correct predictions are suppressed by being assigned 'no relation' as a GT. To address these issues we propose Groupwise Query Specialization and Quality-Aware Multi-Assignment (SpeaQ). Groupwise Query Specialization trains a 'specialized' query by dividing queries and relations into disjoint groups and directing a query in a specific query group solely toward relations in the corresponding relation group. Quality-Aware Multi-Assignment further facilitates the training by assigning a GT to multiple predictions that are significantly close to a GT in terms of a subject an object and the relation in between. Experimental results and analyses show that SpeaQ effectively trains 'specialized' queries which better utilize the capacity of a model resulting in consistent performance gains with 'zero' additional inference cost across multiple VRD models and benchmarks.

Test-time adaptation has proven its effectiveness in tackling the cross-domain distribution shift during inference. However most existing methods achieve adaptation by updating the pre-trained models rendering them susceptible to error accumulation and catastrophic forgetting when encountering a series of distribution shifts (i.e. under the continual test-time adaptation setup). To overcome these challenges caused by updating the models in this paper we freeze the pre-trained model and propose the Visual Prompt-based Test-Time Adaptation (VPTTA) method to train a specific prompt for each test image to align the statistics in the batch normalization layers.

However we argue that a global CFG scale results in spatial inconsistency on varying semantic strengths and suboptimal image quality. To address this problem we present a novel approach Semantic-aware Classifier-Free Guidance (S-CFG) to customize the guidance degrees for different semantic units in text-to-image diffusion models. Specifically we first design a training-free semantic segmentation method to partition the latent image into relatively independent semantic regions at each denoising step. In particular the cross-attention map in the denoising U-net backbone is renormalized for assigning each patch to the corresponding token while the self-attention map is used to complete the semantic regions. Then to balance the amplification of diverse semantic units we adaptively adjust the CFG scales across different semantic regions to rescale the text guidance degrees into a uniform level. Finally extensive experiments demonstrate the superiority of S-CFG over the original CFG strategy on various text-to-image diffusion models without requiring any extra training cost. our codes are available at https://github.com/SmilesDZgk/S-CFG."},

To handle various weather conditions an AiO framework is expected to adaptively learn weather-specific knowledge for different degradations and shared knowledge for common patterns. However existing method: 1) rely on extra supervision signals which are usually unknown in real-world applications; 2) employ fixed network structures which restrict the diversity of weather-specific knowledge. In this paper we propose a Language-driven Restoration framework (LDR) to alleviate the aforementioned issues. First we leverage the power of pre-trained vision-language (PVL) models to enrich the diversity of weather-specific knowledge by reasoning about the occurrence type and severity of degradation generating description-based degradation priors. Then with the guidance of degradation prior we sparsely select restoration experts from a candidate list dynamically based on a Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) structure. This enables us to adaptively learn the weather-specific and shared knowledge to handle various weather conditions (e.g. unknown or mixed weather). Experiments on extensive restoration scenarios show our superior performance (see Fig. 1). The source code will be made available."},

EFCIL is of interest because it mitigates concerns about privacy and long-term storage of data while at the same time alleviating the problem of catastrophic forgetting in incremental learning. In this work we introduce task-adaptive saliency for EFCIL and propose a new framework which we call Task-Adaptive Saliency Supervision (TASS) for mitigating the negative effects of saliency drift between different tasks. We first apply boundary-guided saliency to maintain task adaptivity and plasticity on model attention. Besides we introduce task-agnostic low-level signals as auxiliary supervision to increase the stability of model attention. Finally we introduce a module for injecting and recovering saliency noise to increase the robustness of saliency preservation.

Despite the promising potential of current methods challenges persist in effectively extracting and preventing degradation of prominent features as well as enhancing attention on pivotal regions. In this paper we propose an Instance-level Expert Knowledge and Aggregate Discriminative Attention framework (EKAGen) for radiology report generation. We convert expert reports into an embedding space and generate comprehensive representations for each disease which serve as Preliminary Knowledge Support (PKS). To prevent feature disruption we select the representations in the embedding space with the smallest distances to PKS as Rectified Knowledge Support (RKS). Then EKAGen diagnoses the diseases and retrieves knowledge from RKS creating Instance-level Expert Knowledge (IEK) for each query image boosting generation. Additionally we introduce Aggregate Discriminative Attention Map (ADM) which uses weak supervision to create maps of discriminative regions that highlight pivotal regions. For training we propose a Global Information Self-Distillation (GID) strategy using an iteratively optimized model to distill global knowledge into EKAGen. Extensive experiments and analyses on IU X-Ray and MIMIC-CXR datasets demonstrate that EKAGen outperforms previous state-of-the-art methods."},

Current techniques rely heavily on HDR panorama datasets to train neural networks to regress an input with limited field-of-view to a full environment map. However these approaches often struggle with real-world uncontrolled settings due to the limited diversity and size of their datasets. To address this problem we leverage diffusion models trained on billions of standard images to render a chrome ball into the input image. Despite its simplicity this task remains challenging: the diffusion models often insert incorrect or inconsistent objects and cannot readily generate chrome balls in HDR format. Our research uncovers a surprising relationship between the appearance of chrome balls and the initial diffusion noise map which we utilize to consistently generate high-quality chrome balls. We further fine-tune an LDR diffusion model (Stable Diffusion XL) with LoRA enabling it to perform exposure bracketing for HDR light estimation. Our method produces convincing light estimates across diverse settings and demonstrates superior generalization to in-the-wild scenarios."},

Modern approaches use only captured images to predict occupancy maps that represent the geometry. Training these approaches requires accurate data that may be acquired with the help of LiDAR scanners. We show that the techniques used for current benchmarks and training datasets to convert LiDAR scans into occupancy grid maps yield very low quality and subsequently present a novel approach using evidence theory that yields more accurate reconstructions. We demonstrate that these are superior by a large margin both qualitatively and quantitatively and that we additionally obtain meaningful uncertainty estimates. When converting the occupancy maps back to depth estimates and comparing them with the raw LiDAR measurements our method yields a MAE improvement of 30% to 52% on nuScenes and 53% on Waymo over other occupancy ground-truth data. Finally we use the improved occupancy maps to train a state-of-the-art occupancy prediction method and demonstrate that it improves the MAE by 25% on nuScenes."},

In this paper we propose an Adaptive Bidirectional Displacement (ABD) approach to solve the above challenge. Specifically we first design a bidirectional patch displacement based on reliable prediction confidence for unlabeled data to generate new samples which can effectively suppress uncontrollable regions and still retain the influence of input perturbations. Meanwhile to enforce the model to learn the potentially uncontrollable content a bidirectional displacement operation with inverse confidence is proposed for the labeled images which generates samples with more unreliable information to facilitate model learning.

The T2I prior model alone adds a billion parameters compared to the Latent Diffusion Models which increases the computational and high-quality data requirements. We introduce ECLIPSE a novel contrastive learning method that is both parameter and data-efficient.

These networks typically produce a global representation of a place image using only this image itself and neglect the cross-image variations (e.g. viewpoint and illumination) which limits their robustness in challenging scenes. In this paper we propose a robust global representation method with cross-image correlation awareness for VPR named CricaVPR. Our method uses the attention mechanism to correlate multiple images within a batch. These images can be taken in the same place with different conditions or viewpoints or even captured from different places. Therefore our method can utilize the cross-image variations as a cue to guide the representation learning which ensures more robust features are produced. To further facilitate the robustness we propose a multi-scale convolution-enhanced adaptation method to adapt pre-trained visual foundation models to the VPR task which introduces the multi-scale local information to further enhance the cross-image correlation-aware representation. Experimental results show that our method outperforms state-of-the-art methods by a large margin with significantly less training time. The code is released at https://github.com/Lu-Feng/CricaVPR."},

In this work we leverage two complementary sources of information -- descriptions of categories generated by large language models (LLMs) and abundant fine-grained image classification datasets -- to improve the zero-shot classification performance of VLMs across fine-grained domains. On the technical side we develop methods to train VLMs with this \"bag-level\" image-text supervision. We find that simply using these attributes at test-time does not improve performance but our training strategy for example on the iNaturalist dataset leads to an average improvement of 4-5% in zero-shot classification accuracy for novel categories of birds and flowers. Similar improvements are observed in domains where a subset of the categories was used to fine-tune the model. By prompting LLMs in various ways we generate descriptions that capture visual appearance habitat and geographic regions and pair them with existing attributes such as the taxonomic structure of the categories. We systematically evaluate their ability to improve zero-shot categorization in natural domains. Our findings suggest that geographic priors can be just as effective and are complementary to visual appearance. Our method also outperforms prior work on prompt-based tuning of VLMs. We release the benchmark consisting of 14 datasets at https://github.com/cvl-umass/AdaptCLIPZS which will contribute to future research in zero-shot recognition."},

Extensive studies have demonstrated that combining these two approaches can achieve state-of-the-art performance. However these methods essentially reinforce the global consistency of contrastive learning without taking into account the conflicts between these two approaches which hinders their generalizability to arbitrary scenarios. In this paper we theoretically prove that MAE serves as a patch-level contrastive learning where each patch within an image is considered as a distinct category. This presents a significant conflict with global-level contrastive learning which treats all patches in an image as an identical category. To address this conflict this work abandons the non-generalizable global-level constraints and proposes explicit patch-level contrastive learning as a solution. Specifically this work employs the encoder of MAE to generate dual-branch features which then perform patch-level learning through a decoder. In contrast to global-level data augmentation in contrastive learning our approach leverages patch-level feature augmentation to mitigate interference from global-level learning. Consequently our approach can learn heterogeneous representations from a single image while avoiding the conflicts encountered by previous methods. Massive experiments affirm the potential of our method for learning from arbitrary scenarios."},

Unlike previous works that use implicit neural representations and volume rendering (e.g. NeRF) which suffer from low expressive power and high computational complexity we extend GS a top-performance representation for novel view synthesis to estimate scene geometry surface material and environment illumination from multi-view images captured under unknown lighting conditions. There are two main problems when introducing GS to inverse rendering: 1) GS does not support producing plausible normal natively; 2) forward mapping (e.g. rasterization and splatting) cannot trace the occlusion like backward mapping (e.g. ray tracing). To address these challenges our GS-IR proposes an efficient optimization scheme that incorporates a depth-derivation-based regularization for normal estimation and a baking-based occlusion to model indirect lighting. The flexible and expressive GS representation allows us to achieve fast and compact geometry reconstruction photorealistic novel view synthesis and effective physically-based rendering.

This paper introduces Text2QR a pioneering approach leveraging these advancements to address a fundamental challenge: concurrently achieving user-defined aesthetics and scanning robustness. To ensure stable generation of aesthetic QR codes we introduce the QR Aesthetic Blueprint (QAB) module generating a blueprint image exerting control over the entire generation process.

In this paper we present a practical method for acquiring scattering properties of translucent materials based solely on ordinary images captured with unknown lighting and camera parameters. The key to our method is an inter-pixel translucency prior which states that image pixels of a given homogeneous translucent material typically form curves (dubbed translucent curves) in the RGB space of which the shapes are determined by the parameters of the material. We leverage this prior in a specially-designed convolutional neural network comprising multiple encoders a translucency-aware feature fusion module and a cascaded decoder.

We find that the DETR resonates with the underlying principles of Faster R-CNN's RPN-refiner design but benefits from end-to-end detection owing to the incorporation of Hungarian matching. We systematically adapt the Faster R-CNN towards the Deformable DETR by integrating or repurposing each component of Deformable DETR and note that Deformable DETR's improved performance over Faster R-CNN is attributed to the adoption of advanced modules such as a superior proposal refiner (e.g. deformable attention rather than RoI Align). When viewing the DETR through the RPN-refiner paradigm we delve into various proposal refinement techniques such as deformable attention cross attention and dynamic convolution. These proposal refiners cooperate well with each other; thus we synergistically combine them to establish a Hybrid Proposal Refiner (HPR).

Specifically we reveal that with a standard pretrained model Parameter-Efficient Finetuning (PEFT) methods either fail to be adversarially robust or continue to exhibit significantly degraded adversarial robustness on downstream tasks even with adversarial training during finetuning. Leveraging a robust pretrained model surprisingly we observe that a simple linear probing can outperform full finetuning and other PEFT methods with random initialization on certain datasets.

A Perspective from Network Quantization", "authors": "Guobin Shen, Dongcheng Zhao, Tenglong Li, Jindong Li, Yi Zeng", "abstract": "Spiking Neural Networks (SNNs) have been widely praised for their high energy efficiency and immense potential. However comprehensive research that critically contrasts and correlates SNNs with quantized Artificial Neural Networks (ANNs) remains scant often leading to skewed comparisons lacking fairness towards ANNs. This paper introduces a unified perspective illustrating that the time steps in SNNs and quantized bit-widths of activation values present analogous representations. Building on this we present a more pragmatic and rational approach to estimating the energy consumption of SNNs. Diverging from the conventional Synaptic Operations (SynOps) we champion the \"Bit Budget\" concept. This notion permits an intricate discourse on strategically allocating computational and storage resources between weights activation values and temporal steps under stringent hardware constraints. Guided by the Bit Budget paradigm we discern that pivoting efforts towards spike patterns and weight quantization rather than temporal attributes elicits profound implications for model performance. Utilizing the Bit Budget for holistic design consideration of SNNs elevates model performance across diverse data types encompassing static imagery and neuromorphic datasets. Our revelations bridge the theoretical chasm between SNNs and quantized ANNs and illuminate a pragmatic trajectory for future endeavors in energy-efficient neural computations."},

Various methods have been proposed to address the challenging problem of VsTP. However due to the diversified targets and heterogeneous schemas previous works usually design task-specific architectures and objectives for individual tasks which inadvertently leads to modal isolation and complex workflow. In this paper we propose a unified paradigm for parsing visually-situated text across diverse scenarios. Specifically we devise a universal model called OmniParser which can simultaneously handle three typical visually-situated text parsing tasks: text spotting key information extraction and table recognition. In OmniParser all tasks share the unified encoder-decoder architecture the unified objective: point-conditioned text generation and the unified input & output representation: prompt & structured sequences. Extensive experiments demonstrate that the proposed OmniParser achieves state-of-the-art (SOTA) or highly competitive performances on 7 datasets for the three visually-situated text parsing tasks despite its unified concise design.

The text-shape pairs exhibit a hierarchical structure where a general text like \"chair\" covers all 3D shapes of the chair while more detailed prompts refer to more specific shapes. Furthermore both text and 3D shapes are inherently hierarchical structures. However existing Text2Shape methods such as SDFusion do not exploit that. In this work we propose HyperSDFusion a dual-branch diffusion model that generates 3D shapes from a given text. Since hyperbolic space is suitable for handling hierarchical data we propose to learn the hierarchical representations of text and 3D shapes in hyperbolic space. First we introduce a hyperbolic text-image encoder to learn the sequential and multi-modal hierarchical features of text in hyperbolic space. In addition we design a hyperbolic text-graph convolution module to learn the hierarchical features of text in hyperbolic space. In order to fully utilize these text features we introduce a dual-branch structure to embed text features in 3D feature space. At last to endow the generated 3D shapes with a hierarchical structure we devise a hyperbolic hierarchical loss. Our method is the first to explore the hyperbolic hierarchical representation for text-to-shape generation. Experimental results on the existing text-to-shape paired dataset Text2Shape achieved state-of-the-art results. We release our implementation under HyperSDFusion.github.io."},

Prior research on editing 3D objects primarily concentrated on editing individual objects by leveraging off-the-shelf 2D image editing networks utilizing a process called 3D distillation which transfers knowledge from the 2D network to the 3D asset. Distillation necessitates at least tens of minutes per asset to attain satisfactory editing results thus it is not very practical. In contrast we ask whether 3D editing can be carried out directly by a feed-forward network eschewing test-time optimization. In particular we hypothesise that this process can be greatly simplified by first encoding 3D objects into a suitable latent space. We validate this hypothesis by building upon the latent space of Shap-E. We demonstrate that direct 3D editing in this space is possible and efficient by learning a feed-forward editor network that only requires approximately one second per edit. Our experiments show that Shap-Editor generalises well to both in-distribution and out-of-distribution 3D assets with different prompts and achieves superior performance compared to methods that carry out test-time optimisation for each edited instance."},

Given a single input view we sample multiple possible material explanations represented as albedo roughness and metallic maps. Appearance decomposition poses a considerable challenge in computer vision due to the inherent ambiguity between lighting and material properties and the lack of real datasets. To address this issue we advocate for a probabilistic formulation where instead of attempting to directly predict the true material properties we employ a conditional generative model to sample from the solution space. Furthermore we show that utilizing the strong learned prior of recent diffusion models trained on large-scale real-world images can be adapted to material estimation and highly improves the generalization to real images. Our method produces significantly sharper more consistent and more detailed materials outperforming state-of-the-art methods by 1.5dB on PSNR and by 45% better FID score on albedo prediction. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach through experiments on both synthetic and real-world datasets."},

However existing approaches focus on generating horizontal bounding boxes (HBBs) while ignoring oriented bounding boxes (OBBs) commonly used for objects in aerial images. This paper proposes PointOBB the first single Point-based OBB generation method for oriented object detection. PointOBB operates through the collaborative utilization of three distinctive views: an original view a resized view and a rotated/flipped (rot/flp) view. Upon the original view we leverage the resized and rot/flp views to build a scale augmentation module and an angle acquisition module respectively. In the former module a Scale-Sensitive Consistency (SSC) loss is designed to enhance the deep network's ability to perceive the object scale. For accurate object angle predictions the latter module incorporates self-supervised learning to predict angles which is associated with a scale-guided Dense-to-Sparse (DS) matching strategy for aggregating dense angles corresponding to sparse objects. The resized and rot/flp views are switched using a progressive multi-view switching strategy during training to achieve coupled optimization of scale and angle. Experimental results on the DIOR-R and DOTA-v1.0 datasets demonstrate that PointOBB achieves promising performance and significantly outperforms potential point-supervised baselines."},

However fine-tuning methods require independent training for every model leading to huge computation and memory overheads. In this paper we propose a novel setting where we aim to improve the performance of diverse MLLMs with a group of shared parameters optimized for a downstream task. To achieve this we propose Transferable Visual Prompting (TVP) a simple and effective approach to generate visual prompts that can transfer to different models and improve their performance on downstream tasks after trained on only one model. We introduce two strategies to address the issue of cross-model feature corruption of existing visual prompting methods and enhance the transferability of the learned prompts including 1) Feature Consistency Alignment: which imposes constraints to the prompted feature changes to maintain task-agnostic knowledge; 2) Task Semantics Enrichment: which encourages the prompted images to contain richer task-specific semantics with language guidance. We validate the effectiveness of TVP through extensive experiments with 6 modern MLLMs on a wide variety of tasks ranging from object recognition and counting to multimodal reasoning and hallucination correction."},

Concretely we seek to explain the decision-making process of video transformers based on high-level spatiotemporal concepts that are automatically discovered. Prior research on concept-based interpretability has concentrated solely on image-level tasks. Comparatively video models deal with the added temporal dimension increasing complexity and posing challenges in identifying dynamic concepts over time. In this work we systematically address these challenges by introducing the first Video Transformer Concept Discovery (VTCD) algorithm. To this end we propose an efficient approach for unsupervised identification of units of video transformer representations - concepts and ranking their importance to the output of a model. The resulting concepts are highly interpretable revealing spatio-temporal reasoning mechanisms and object-centric representations in unstructured video models. Performing this analysis jointly over a diverse set of supervised and self-supervised representations we discover that some of these mechanism are universal in video transformers. Finally we show that VTCD can be used for fine-grained action recognition and video object segmentation."},

Most existing methods approach the goal by learning to predict isolated interaction elements e.g. human contact object affordance and human-object spatial relation primarily from the perspective of either the human or the object. Which underexploit certain correlations between the interaction counterparts (human and object) and struggle to address the uncertainty in interactions. Actually objects' functionalities potentially affect humans' interaction intentions which reveals what the interaction is. Meanwhile the interacting humans and objects exhibit matching geometric structures which presents how to interact. In light of this we propose harnessing these inherent correlations between interaction counterparts to mitigate the uncertainty and jointly anticipate the above interaction elements in 3D space. To achieve this we present LEMON (LEarning 3D huMan-Object iNteraction relation) a unified model that mines interaction intentions of the counterparts and employs curvatures to guide the extraction of geometric correlations combining them to anticipate the interaction elements. Besides the 3D Interaction Relation dataset (3DIR) is collected to serve as the test bed for training and evaluation. Extensive experiments demonstrate the superiority of LEMON over methods estimating each element in isolation. The code and dataset are available at https://yyvhang.github.io/LEMON/"},

This work presents Low-Latency neural codec for Stereo video Streaming (LLSS) a novel parallel stereo video coding method designed for fast and efficient low-latency stereo video streaming. Instead of using a sequential cross-view motion compensation like existing methods LLSS introduces a bidirectional feature shifting module to directly exploit mutual information among views and encode them effectively with a joint cross-view prior model for entropy coding. Thanks to this design LLSS processes left and right views in parallel minimizing latency; all while substantially improving R-D performance compared to both existing neural and conventional codecs."},

In this work we address the task as the problem of inferring dense long-range motion of 3D points. By observing a set of point trajectories we aim to learn an implicit motion field parameterized by a neural network to predict the movement of novel points within the same domain without relying on any data-driven or scene-specific priors. To achieve this our approach builds upon the recently introduced dynamic point field model that learns smooth deformation fields between the canonical frame and individual observation frames. However temporal consistency between consecutive frames is neglected and the number of required parameters increases linearly with the sequence length due to per-frame modeling. To address these shortcomings we exploit the intrinsic regularization provided by SIREN and modify the input layer to produce a spatiotemporally smooth motion field. Additionally we analyze the motion field Jacobian matrix and discover that the motion degrees of freedom (DOFs) in an infinitesimal area around a point and the network hidden variables have different behaviors to affect the model's representational power. This enables us to improve the model representation capability while retaining the model compactness. Furthermore to reduce the risk of overfitting we introduce a regularization term based on the assumption of piece-wise motion smoothness. Our experiments assess the model's performance in predicting unseen point trajectories and its application in temporal mesh alignment with guidance. The results demonstrate its superiority and effectiveness. The code and data for the project are publicly available at https://yz-cnsdqz.github.io/eigenmotion/DOMA."},

In this paper we propose addressing this challenge by leveraging the controllable and flexible language prompt of the VFM. Observing that the text modality of VFMs is inherently easier to disentangle we introduce a novel text feature guided visual prompt tuning framework. This framework first automatically disentangles the text prompt using a large language model (LLM) and then learns domain-invariant visual representation guided by the disentangled text feature.

Although these image-language models can efficiently represent both video and language branches they typically employ a goal-free vision perception process and do not interact vision with language well during the answer generation thus omitting crucial visual cues. In this paper we are inspired by the human recognition and learning pattern and propose VideoDistill a framework with language-aware (i.e. goal-driven) behavior in both vision perception and answer generation process. VideoDistill generates answers only from question-related visual embeddings and follows a thinking-observing-answering approach that closely resembles human behavior distinguishing it from previous research. Specifically we develop a language-aware gating mechanism to replace the standard cross-attention avoiding language's direct fusion into visual representations. We incorporate this mechanism into two key components of the entire framework. The first component is a differentiable sparse sampling module which selects frames containing the necessary dynamics and semantics relevant to the questions. The second component is a vision refinement module that merges existing spatial-temporal attention layers to ensure the extraction of multi-grained visual semantics associated with the questions. We conduct experimental evaluations on various challenging video question-answering benchmarks and VideoDistill achieves state-of-the-art performance in both general and long-form VideoQA datasets.

In response we introduce SIFU (Side-view Conditioned Implicit Function for Real-world Usable Clothed Human Reconstruction) a novel approach combining a Side-view Decoupling Transformer with a 3D Consistent Texture Refinement pipeline. SIFU employs a cross-attention mechanism within the transformer using SMPL-X normals as queries to effectively decouple side-view features in the process of mapping 2D features to 3D.

Fixed-precision quantization suffers from performance drop due to the limited numerical representation ability. Conversely mixed-precision quantization (MPQ) is advocated to compress the model effectively by allocating heterogeneous bit-width for layers. MPQ is typically organized into a searching-retraining two-stage process. Previous works only focus on determining the optimal bit-width configuration in the first stage efficiently while ignoring the considerable time costs in the second stage. However retraining always consumes hundreds of GPU-hours on the cutting-edge GPUs thus hindering deployment efficiency significantly. In this paper we devise a one-shot training-searching paradigm for mixed-precision model compression. Specifically in the first stage all potential bit-width configurations are coupled and thus optimized simultaneously within a set of shared weights. However our observations reveal a previously unseen and severe bit-width interference phenomenon among highly coupled weights during optimization leading to considerable performance degradation under a high compression ratio. To tackle this problem we first design a bit-width scheduler to dynamically freeze the most turbulent bit-width of layers during training to ensure the rest bit-widths converged properly. Then taking inspiration from information theory we present an information distortion mitigation technique to align the behaviour of the bad-performing bit-widths to the well-performing ones. In the second stage an inference-only greedy search scheme is devised to evaluate the goodness of configurations without introducing any additional training costs.

Our key idea is to design action slots that are capable of paying attention to regions where atomic activities occur without the need for explicit perception guidance. To further enhance slot attention we introduce a background slot that competes with action slots aiding the training process in avoiding unnecessary focus on background regions devoid of activities. Yet the imbalanced class distribution in the existing dataset hampers the assessment of rare activities. To address the limitation we collect a synthetic dataset called TACO which is four times larger than OATS and features a balanced distribution of atomic activities. To validate the effectiveness of our method we conduct comprehensive experiments and ablation studies against various action recognition baselines. We also show that the performance of multi-label atomic activity recognition on real-world datasets can be improved by pretraining representations on TACO."},

Specifically we first propose to directly fit the mutual information of high-dimensional spaces by leveraging normalized kernel Gram matrix which does not require any auxiliary neural estimator to estimate the lower bound of mutual information. Then based on the new mutual information measurement a deterministic multi-view neural network with analytical gradients is explicitly trained to parameterize IB principle which derives a deterministic compression of input variables from different views. Finally a triplet consistency discovery mechanism is devised which is capable of mining the feature consistency cluster consistency and joint consistency based on the deterministic and compact representations. Extensive experimental results show the superiority of our DIB method on 6 benchmarks compared with 13 state-of-the-art baselines."},

Language-embedded scene representations have made progress by incorporating language features into 3D spaces. However their efficacy heavily depends on neural networks that are resource-intensive in training and rendering. Although recent 3D Gaussians offer efficient and high-quality novel view synthesis directly embedding language features in them leads to prohibitive memory usage and decreased performance. In this work we introduce Language Embedded 3D Gaussians a novel scene representation for open-vocabulary query tasks. Instead of embedding high-dimensional raw semantic features on 3D Gaussians we propose a dedicated quantization scheme that drastically alleviates the memory requirement and a novel embedding procedure that achieves smoother yet high accuracy query countering the multi-view feature inconsistencies and the high-frequency inductive bias in point-based representations. Our comprehensive experiments show that our representation achieves the best visual quality and language querying accuracy across current language-embedded representations while maintaining real-time rendering frame rates on a single desktop GPU."},

To address these challenges we propose a novel approach that leverages FisheyeViT to extract fisheye image features which are subsequently converted into pixel-aligned 3D heatmap representations for 3D human body pose prediction. For hand tracking we incorporate dedicated hand detection and hand pose estimation networks for regressing 3D hand poses. Finally we develop a diffusion-based whole-body motion prior model to refine the estimated whole-body motion while accounting for joint uncertainties. To train these networks we collect a large synthetic dataset EgoWholeBody comprising 840000 high-quality egocentric images captured across a diverse range of whole-body motion sequences.

We devise strategies for model self-disambiguation prior knowledge incorporation and imbalance mitigation to tackle challenges associated with inconsistently labeled multi-source data including label ambiguity and modality dataset and class imbalances. Experimental results on a multi-modal dataset compiled from eight different sources for abdominal structure segmentation have demonstrated the effectiveness and superior performance of our method compared to state-of-the-art alternative approaches.

However annotating the Mean opinion score (MOS) for videos is expensive and time-consuming which limits the scale of VQA datasets and poses a significant obstacle for deep learning-based methods. In this paper we propose a VQA method named PTM-VQA which leverages PreTrained Models to transfer knowledge from models pretrained on various pre-tasks enabling benefits for VQA from different aspects. Specifically we extract features of videos from different pretrained models with frozen weights and integrate them to generate representation. Since these models possess various fields of knowledge and are often trained with labels irrelevant to quality we propose an Intra-Consistency and Inter-Divisibility (ICID) loss to impose constraints on features extracted by multiple pretrained models. The intra-consistency constraint ensures that features extracted by different pretrained models are in the same unified quality-aware latent space while the inter-divisibility introduces pseudo clusters based on the annotation of samples and tries to separate features of samples from different clusters. Furthermore with a constantly growing number of pretrained models it is crucial to determine which models to use and how to use them. To address this problem we propose an efficient scheme to select suitable candidates. Models with better clustering performance on VQA datasets are chosen to be our candidates.

However most top-performing tracking algorithms rely on many hand-crafted components for spatio-temporal information aggregation. Consequently the spatio-temporal information is far away from being fully explored. To alleviate this issue we propose an adaptive tracker with spatio-temporal transformers (named AQATrack) which adopts simple autoregressive queries to effectively learn spatio-temporal information without many hand-designed components. Firstly we introduce a set of learnable and autoregressive queries to capture the instantaneous target appearance changes in a sliding window fashion. Then we design a novel attention mechanism for the interaction of existing queries to generate a new query in current frame. Finally based on the initial target template and learnt autoregressive queries a spatio-temporal information fusion module (STM) is designed for spatiotemporal formation aggregation to locate a target object. Benefiting from the STM we can effectively combine the static appearance and instantaneous changes to guide robust tracking.

Recently pre-trained models with prompt tuning have shown strong generalization capabilities and attained noteworthy achievements in various downstream tasks such as few-shot learning and video-text retrieval. However applying them directly to UCDR may not be sufficient to handle both domain shift (i.e. adapting to unfamiliar domains) and semantic shift (i.e. transferring to unknown categories). To this end we propose Prompting-to-Simulate (ProS) the first method to apply prompt tuning for UCDR.

However fine-tuning often demands large memory consumption posing a challenge for low-memory devices that some previous memory-efficient fine-tuning methods attempted to mitigate by pruning activations for gradient computation albeit at the cost of significant computational overhead from the pruning processes during training. To address these challenges we introduce PreBackRazor a novel activation pruning scheme offering both computational and memory efficiency through a sparsified backpropagation strategy which judiciously avoids unnecessary activation pruning and storage and gradient computation. Before activation pruning our approach samples a probability of selecting a portion of parameters to freeze utilizing a bandit method for updates to prioritize impactful gradients on convergence. During the feed-forward pass each model layer adjusts adaptively based on parameter activation status obviating the need for sparsification and storage of redundant activations for subsequent backpropagation.

Although previous studies have introduced pruning after the initial capsule layer dynamic routing's fully connected nature and non-orthogonal weight matrices reintroduce redundancy in deeper layers. Besides dynamic routing requires iterating to converge further increasing computational demands. In this paper we propose an Orthogonal Capsule Network (OrthCaps) to reduce redundancy improve routing performance and decrease parameter counts. Firstly an efficient pruned capsule layer is introduced to discard redundant capsules. Secondly dynamic routing is replaced with orthogonal sparse attention routing eliminating the need for iterations and fully connected structures. Lastly weight matrices during routing are orthogonalized to sustain low capsule similarity which is the first approach to use Householder orthogonal decomposition to enforce orthogonality in CapsNet. Our experiments on baseline datasets affirm the efficiency and robustness of OrthCaps in classification tasks in which ablation studies validate the criticality of each component. OrthCaps-Shallow outperforms other Capsule Network benchmarks on four datasets utilizing only 110k parameters - a mere 1.25% of a standard Capsule Network's total.

Specifically we manipulate the features of self-attention layers as the way the cross-attention mechanism works; in the generation process substituting the key and value of content with those of style image. This approach provides several desirable characteristics for style transfer including 1) preservation of content by transferring similar styles into similar image patches and 2) transfer of style based on similarity of local texture (e.g. edge) between content and style images. Furthermore we introduce query preservation and attention temperature scaling to mitigate the issue of disruption of original content and initial latent Adaptive Instance Normalization (AdaIN) to deal with the disharmonious color (failure to transfer the colors of style).

Recent WSSS works have shown promising results by using the Segment Anything Model (SAM) a foundation model for segmentation during the inference phase. However we observe that these methods can still be vulnerable to the noise of class activation maps (CAMs) serving as initial seeds. As a remedy this paper introduces From-SAM-to-CAMs (S2C) a novel WSSS framework that directly transfers the knowledge of SAM to the classifier during the training process enhancing the quality of CAMs itself. S2C comprises SAM-segment Contrasting (SSC) and a CAM-based prompting module (CPM) which exploit SAM at the feature and logit levels respectively. SSC performs prototype-based contrasting using SAM's automatic segmentation results. It constrains each feature to be close to the prototype of its segment and distant from prototypes of the others. Meanwhile CPM extracts prompts from the CAM of each class and uses them to generate class-specific segmentation masks through SAM. The masks are aggregated into unified self-supervision based on the confidence score designed to consider the reliability of both SAM and CAMs. S2C achieves a new state-of-the-art performance across all benchmarks outperforming existing studies by significant margins.

To provide consistent and controllable editing we propose the image-based video-NeRF editing pipeline with a set of innovative designs including multi-view multi-pose Score Distillation Sampling (SDS) from both the 2D personalized diffusion prior and 3D diffusion prior reconstruction losses text-guided local parts super-resolution and style transfer.

These techniques aim to stabilize videos by synthesizing full frames while enhancing the stability of the considered video. This intensifies the complexity of the task due to the distinct mix of unique motion profiles and visual content present in each video sequence making robust generalization with fixed parameters difficult. In our study we introduce a novel approach to enhance the performance of pixel-level synthesis solutions for video stabilization by adapting these models to individual input video sequences. The proposed adaptation exploits low-level visual cues accessible during test-time to improve both the stability and quality of resulting videos. We highlight the efficacy of our methodology of \"test-time adaptation\" through simple fine-tuning of one of these models followed by significant stability gain via the integration of meta-learning techniques. Notably significant improvement is achieved with only a single adaptation step. The versatility of the proposed algorithm is demonstrated by consistently improving the performance of various pixel-level synthesis models for video stabilization in real-world scenarios."},

However FAC models trained by traditional methodologies can be unfair by exhibiting accuracy inconsistencies across varied data subpopulations. This unfairness is largely attributed to bias in data where some spurious attributes (e.g. Male) statistically correlate with the target attribute (e.g. Smiling). Most of existing fairness-aware methods rely on the labels of spurious attributes which may be unavailable in practice. This work proposes a novel generation-based two-stage framework to train a fair FAC model on biased data without additional annotation. Initially we identify the potential spurious attributes based on generative models. Notably it enhances interpretability by explicitly showing the spurious attributes in image space. Following this for each image we first edit the spurious attributes with a random degree sampled from a uniform distribution while keeping target attribute unchanged. Then we train a fair FAC model by fostering model invariance to these augmentation. Extensive experiments on three common datasets demonstrate the effectiveness of our method in promoting fairness in FAC without compromising accuracy.

The results depicted in Fig. 1 rendered at full HD resolution on a contemporary desktop machine demonstrate that our system achieves real-time performance with a wide variety of appearances which is approached by the following two designs. Firstly recognizing that the bidirectional reflectance is distributed in a sparse high-dimensional space we propose to project the BRDF into two low-dimensional components i.e. two hemisphere feature-grids for incoming and outgoing directions respectively. Secondly we distribute learnable neural reflectance primitives on our highly-tailored spherical surface grid. These primitives offer informative features for each hemisphere component and reduce the complexity of the feature learning network leading to fast evaluation. These primitives are centrally stored in a codebook and can be shared across multiple grids and even across materials based on low-cost indices stored in material-specific spherical surface grids. Our NeuBRDF agnostic to the material provides a unified framework for representing a variety of materials consistently. Comprehensive experimental results on measured BRDF compression Monte Carlo simulated BRDF acceleration and extension to spatially varying effects demonstrate the superior quality and generalizability achieved by the proposed scheme."},

At the core of our method lies the decomposition of the challenging single-view reconstruction problem into generative hallucination and reconstruction subproblems. For the former we employ a powerful generative diffusion model to hallucinate unseen back-view appearance based on the input images. For the latter we leverage skinned body meshes as guidance to recover full-body texture meshes from the input and back-view images. SiTH requires as few as 500 3D human scans for training while maintaining its generality and robustness to diverse images.

Recent works have focused on end-to-end learning-based transformer designs which struggle to resolve geometric information accurately particularly during occlusion. Instead we propose a novel hybrid model MVGFormer which has a series of geometric and appearance modules organized in an iterative manner. The geometry modules are learning-free and handle all viewpoint-dependent 3D tasks geometrically which notably improves the model's generalization ability. The appearance modules are learnable and are dedicated to estimating 2D poses from image signals end-to-end which enables them to achieve accurate estimates even when occlusion occurs leading to a model that is both accurate and generalizable to new cameras and geometries. We evaluate our approach for both in-domain and out-of-domain settings where our model consistently outperforms state-of-the-art methods and especially does so by a significant margin in the out-of-domain setting.

However they encounter difficulties in achieving both high-realism and high-fidelity at low bitrate as the pixel-space distortion may not align with human perception. To address this issue we introduce a Generative Latent Coding (GLC) architecture which performs transform coding in the latent space of a generative vector-quantized variational auto-encoder (VQ-VAE) instead of in the pixel space. The generative latent space is characterized by greater sparsity richer semantic and better alignment with human perception rendering it advantageous for achieving high-realism and high-fidelity compression. Additionally we introduce a categorical hyper module to reduce the bit cost of hyper-information and a code-prediction-based supervision to enhance the semantic consistency. Experiments demonstrate that our GLC maintains high visual quality with less than 0.04 bpp on natural images and less than 0.01 bpp on facial images. On the CLIC2020 test set we achieve the same FID as MS-ILLM with 45% fewer bits. Furthermore the powerful generative latent space enables various applications built on our GLC pipeline such as image restoration and style transfer."},

To address this disparity we introduce PhyScene a novel method dedicated to generating interactive 3D scenes characterized by realistic layouts articulated objects and rich physical interactivity tailored for embodied agents. Based on a conditional diffusion model for capturing scene layouts we devise novel physics- and interactivity-based guidance mechanisms that integrate constraints from object collision room layout and object reachability. Through extensive experiments we demonstrate that PhyScene effectively leverages these guidance functions for physically interactable scene synthesis outperforming existing state-of-the-art scene synthesis methods by a large margin.

However the degree of stylization achieved by existing methods is often not sufficient for practical applications because they are mostly based on statistical 3D Morphable Models (3DMM) with limited variations. To this end we propose a method that can produce a highly stylized 3D face model with desired topology. Our methods train a surface deformation network with 3DMM and translate its domain to the target style using a paired exemplar. The network achieves stylization of the 3D face mesh by mimicking the style of the target using a differentiable renderer and directional CLIP losses. Additionally during the inference process we utilize a Mesh Agnostic Encoder (MAGE) that takes deformation target a mesh of diverse topologies as input to the stylization process and encodes its shape into our latent space. The resulting stylized face model can be animated by commonly used 3DMM blend shapes. A set of quantitative and qualitative evaluations demonstrate that our method can produce highly stylized face meshes according to a given style and output them in a desired topology. We also demonstrate example applications of our method including image-based stylized avatar generation linear interpolation of geometric styles and facial animation of stylized avatars."},

In this study we propose three strategies to improve individual phases of dilated convolution from the view of spectrum analysis. Departing from the conventional practice of fixing a global dilation rate as a hyperparameter we introduce Frequency-Adaptive Dilated Convolution (FADC) which dynamically adjusts dilation rates spatially based on local frequency components. Subsequently we design two plug-in modules to directly enhance effective bandwidth and receptive field size. The Adaptive Kernel (AdaKern) module decomposes convolution weights into low-frequency and high-frequency components dynamically adjusting the ratio between these components on a per-channel basis. By increasing the high-frequency part of convolution weights AdaKern captures more high-frequency components thereby improving effective bandwidth. The Frequency Selection (FreqSelect) module optimally balances high- and low-frequency components in feature representations through spatially variant reweighting. It suppresses high frequencies in the background to encourage FADC to learn a larger dilation thereby increasing the receptive field for an expanded scope. Extensive experiments on segmentation and object detection consistently validate the efficacy of our approach. The code is made publicly available at https://github.com/Linwei-Chen/FADC."},

The outputs can then be combined with other assets to create novel clothed human avatars with any pose. Existing reconstruction approaches often treat clothed humans as a single-layer of geometry and overlook the inherent compositionality of humans with hairstyles clothing and accessories thereby limiting the utility of the meshes for down-stream applications. Decomposing a single-layer mesh into separate layers is a challenging task because it requires the synthesis of plausible geometry and texture for the severely occluded regions. Moreover even with successful decomposition meshes are not normalized in terms of poses and body shapes failing coherent composition with novel identities and poses. To address these challenges we propose to leverage the general knowledge of a pretrained 2D diffusion model as geometry and appearance prior for humans and other assets. We first separate the input mesh using the 3D surface segmentation extracted from multi-view 2D segmentations. Then we synthesize the missing geometry of different layers in both posed and canonical spaces using a novel pose-guided Score Distillation Sampling (SDS) loss. Once we complete inpainting high-fidelity 3D geometry we also apply the same SDS loss to its texture to obtain the complete appearance including the initially occluded regions. Through a series of decomposition steps we obtain multiple layers of 3D assets in a shared canonical space normalized in terms of poses and human shapes hence supporting effortless composition to novel identities and reanimation with novel poses. Our experiments demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach for decomposition canonicalization and composition tasks compared to existing solutions."},

However one persistent challenge that hinders the widespread adoption of NeRFs is the computational bottleneck due to the volumetric rendering. On the other hand 3D Gaussian splatting (3DGS) has recently emerged as an alternative representation that leverages a 3D Gaussisan-based representation and adopts the rasterization pipeline to render the images rather than volumetric rendering achieving very fast rendering speed and promising image quality. However a significant drawback arises as 3DGS entails a substantial number of 3D Gaussians to maintain the high fidelity of the rendered images which requires a large amount of memory and storage. To address this critical issue we place a specific emphasis on two key objectives: reducing the number of Gaussian points without sacrificing performance and compressing the Gaussian attributes such as view-dependent color and covariance. To this end we propose a learnable mask strategy that significantly reduces the number of Gaussians while preserving high performance. In addition we propose a compact but effective representation of view-dependent color by employing a grid-based neural field rather than relying on spherical harmonics. Finally we learn codebooks to compactly represent the geometric attributes of Gaussian by vector quantization. With model compression techniques such as quantization and entropy coding we consistently show over 25x reduced storage and enhanced rendering speed while maintaining the quality of the scene representation compared to 3DGS. Our work provides a comprehensive framework for 3D scene representation achieving high performance fast training compactness and real-time rendering.

Existing Generalized FL (GFL) and Personalized FL (PFL) methods have limitations in balancing performance across both global and local data distributions. In this paper we present a novel algorithm SGPT that integrates GFL and PFL approaches by employing a unique combination of both shared and group-specific prompts. This design enables SGPT to capture both common and group-specific features. A key feature of SGPT is its prompt selection module which facilitates the training of a single global model capable of automatically adapting to diverse local client data distributions without the need for local fine-tuning. To effectively train the prompts we utilize block coordinate descent (BCD) learning from common feature information (shared prompts) and then more specialized knowledge (group prompts) iteratively. Theoretically we justify that learning the proposed prompts can reduce the gap between global and local performance. Empirically we conduct experiments on both label and feature heterogeneity settings in comparison with state-of-the-art baselines along with extensive ablation studies to substantiate the superior performance of SGPT."},

Currently L1 and cross-entropy are the two most widely used losses for stereo network training.

However how to accurately model the stereo ground-truth for cross-entropy loss remains largely under-explored. Existing works simply assume that the ground-truth distributions are uni-modal which ignores the fact that most of the edge pixels can be multi-modal.

Existing methods utilizing diverse scene memories suffer from inefficient exploration since they use all historical observations for decision-making without considering the goal-relevant fraction. To address this limitation we present MemoNav a novel memory model for image-goal navigation which utilizes a working memory-inspired pipeline to improve navigation performance. Specifically we employ three types of navigation memory. The node features on a map are stored in the short-term memory (STM) as these features are dynamically updated. A forgetting module then retains the informative STM fraction to increase efficiency. We also introduce long-term memory (LTM) to learn global scene representations by progressively aggregating STM features. Subsequently a graph attention module encodes the retained STM and the LTM to generate working memory (WM) which contains the scene features essential for efficient navigation. The synergy among these three memory types boosts navigation performance by enabling the agent to learn and leverage goal-relevant scene features within a topological map. Our evaluation on multi-goal tasks demonstrates that MemoNav significantly outperforms previous methods across all difficulty levels in both Gibson and Matterport3D scenes. Qualitative results further illustrate that MemoNav plans more efficient routes."},

However existing techniques for VLMs are task-specific and thus require pruning the network from scratch for each new task of interest. In this work we explore a new direction: Task-Agnostic Vision-Language Pruning (TA-VLP). Given a pretrained VLM the goal is to find a unique pruned counterpart transferable to multiple unknown downstream tasks. In this challenging setting the transferable representations already encoded in the pretrained model are a key aspect to preserve. Thus we propose Multimodal Flow Pruning (MULTIFLOW) a first gradient-free pruning framework for TA-VLP where: (i) the importance of a parameter is expressed in terms of its magnitude and its information flow by incorporating the saliency of the neurons it connects; and (ii) pruning is driven by the emergent (multimodal) distribution of the VLM parameters after pretraining.

We then apply optimal transport theory to align the student model's local visual features with shape-aware tokens derived from CLIP's linguistic output. Additionally we align the student model's global visual features with those from the CLIP image encoder and the 3D SMPL identity space fostering enhanced domain robustness. CLIP3DReID notably excels in discerning discriminative body shape features achieving state-of-the-art results in person ReID. Our approach represents a significant advancement in ReID offering robust solutions to existing challenges and setting new directions for future research."},

Classical frameworks solve this problem in an incremental manner by detecting and matching keypoints registering images triangulating 3D points and conducting bundle adjustment. Recent research efforts have predominantly revolved around harnessing the power of deep learning techniques to enhance specific elements (e.g. keypoint matching) but are still based on the original non-differentiable pipeline. Instead we propose a new deep SfM pipeline where each component is fully differentiable and thus can be trained in an end-to-end manner. To this end we introduce new mechanisms and simplifications. First we build on recent advances in deep 2D point tracking to extract reliable pixel-accurate tracks which eliminates the need for chaining pairwise matches. Furthermore we recover all cameras simultaneously based on the image and track features instead of gradually registering cameras. Finally we optimise the cameras and triangulate 3D points via a differentiable bundle adjustment layer. We attain state-of-the-art performance on three popular datasets CO3D IMC Phototourism and ETH3D."},

Given a set of predefined coordinates and their corresponding descriptions the task is to ensure that generated instances are accurately at the designated locations and that all instances' attributes adhere to their corresponding description. This broadens the scope of current research on Single-instance generation elevating it to a more versatile and practical dimension. Inspired by the idea of divide and conquer we introduce an innovative approach named Multi-Instance Generation Controller (MIGC) to address the challenges of the MIG task. Initially we break down the MIG task into several subtasks each involving the shading of a single instance. To ensure precise shading for each instance we introduce an instance enhancement attention mechanism. Lastly we aggregate all the shaded instances to provide the necessary information for accurately generating multiple instances in stable diffusion (SD). To evaluate how well generation models perform on the MIG task we provide a COCO-MIG benchmark along with an evaluation pipeline. Extensive experiments were conducted on the proposed COCO-MIG benchmark as well as on various commonly used benchmarks.

This poses great challenges given the high correlation between consecutive video frames and there is very little prior work on it. Our framework allows us to do a first deep dive into the topic and includes a collection of streams and tasks composed from two existing video datasets plus methodology for performance evaluation that considers both adaptation and generalization. We employ pixel-to-pixel modelling as a practical and flexible way to switch between pre-training and single-stream evaluation as well as between arbitrary tasks without ever requiring changes to models and always using the same pixel loss. Equipped with this framework we obtained large single-stream learning gains from pre-training with a novel family of future prediction tasks found that momentum hurts and that the pace of weight updates matters. The combination of these insights leads to matching the performance of IID learning with batch size 1 when using the same architecture and without costly replay buffers."},

Unlike existing dense matching based methods that typically struggle with noisy partial scans we propose to leverage category-consistent sparse keypoints to naturally handle both full and partial object scans. Specifically we first employ a lightweight retrieval module to establish a keypoint-based embedding space measuring the similarity among objects by dynamically aggregating deformation-aware local-global features around extracted keypoints. Objects that are close in the embedding space are considered similar in geometry. Then we introduce the neural cage-based deformation module that estimates the influence vector of each keypoint upon cage vertices inside its local support region to control the deformation of the retrieved shape. Extensive experiments on the synthetic dataset PartNet and the real-world dataset Scan2CAD demonstrate that KP-RED surpasses existing state-of-the-art approaches by a large margin.

Prior methods are confined to transferring motion across two subjects within the same or closely related object categories and are applicable for limited domains (e.g. humans). In this work we consider a significantly more challenging setting in which the target and source objects differ drastically in shape and fine-grained motion characteristics (e.g. translating a jumping dog into a dolphin). To this end we leverage a pre-trained and fixed text-to-video diffusion model which provides us with generative and motion priors.

Leveraging its inherent lightweight nature recent research attempted to integrate the powerful pretrained models into federated learning frameworks to simultaneously reduce communication costs and promote local training on insufficient data. Despite these efforts current federated prompt learning methods lack specialized designs to systematically address severe data heterogeneities e.g. data distribution with both label and feature shifts involved. To address this challenge we present Federated Prompts Cooperation via Optimal Transport (FedOTP) which introduces efficient collaborative prompt learning strategies to capture diverse category traits on a per-client basis. Specifically for each client we learn a global prompt to extract consensus knowledge among clients and a local prompt to capture client-specific category characteristics. Unbalanced Optimal Transport is then employed to align local visual features with these prompts striking a balance between global consensus and local personalization. By relaxing one of the equality constraints FedOTP enables prompts to focus solely on core image patch regions. Extensive experiments on datasets with various types of heterogeneities have demonstrated that our FedOTP outperforms the state-of-the-art methods."},

Despite showing impressive generative capabilities most of these models rely on the current sample to denoise the next one possibly resulting in denoising instability. In this paper we reinterpret the iterative denoising process as model optimization and leverage a moving average mechanism to ensemble all the prior samples. Instead of simply applying moving average to the denoised samples at different timesteps we first map the denoised samples to data space and then perform moving average to avoid distribution shift across timesteps. In view that diffusion models evolve the recovery from low-frequency components to high-frequency details we further decompose the samples into different frequency components and execute moving average separately on each component. We name the complete approach \"Moving Average Sampling in Frequency domain (MASF)\". MASF could be seamlessly integrated into mainstream pre-trained diffusion models and sampling schedules. Extensive experiments on both unconditional and conditional diffusion models demonstrate that our MASF leads to superior performances compared to the baselines with almost negligible additional complexity cost."},

However the high computational costs of these video pose transformers (VPTs) make them impractical on resource-constrained devices. In this paper we present a plug-and-play pruning-and-recovering framework called Hourglass Tokenizer (HoT) for efficient transformer-based 3D human pose estimation from videos. Our HoT begins with pruning pose tokens of redundant frames and ends with recovering full-length tokens resulting in a few pose tokens in the intermediate transformer blocks and thus improving the model efficiency. To effectively achieve this we propose a token pruning cluster (TPC) that dynamically selects a few representative tokens with high semantic diversity while eliminating the redundancy of video frames. In addition we develop a token recovering attention (TRA) to restore the detailed spatio-temporal information based on the selected tokens thereby expanding the network output to the original full-length temporal resolution for fast inference. Extensive experiments on two benchmark datasets (i.e. Human3.6M and MPI-INF-3DHP) demonstrate that our method can achieve both high efficiency and estimation accuracy compared to the original VPT models. For instance applying to MotionBERT and MixSTE on Human3.6M our HoT can save nearly 50% FLOPs without sacrificing accuracy and nearly 40% FLOPs with only 0.2% accuracy drop respectively.

Existing works have proposed different methods to embed category cues into the model e.g. through few-shot fine-tuning providing category names or textual descriptions to Vision-Language Models. Fine-tuning is time-consuming and degrades the generalization capability. Textual descriptions could be ambiguous and fail to depict visual details. This paper tackles open-vocabulary recognition from a different perspective by referring to multi-modal clues composed of textual descriptions and exemplar images. Our method named OVMR adopts two innovative components to pursue a more robust category cues embedding. A multi-modal classifier is first generated by dynamically complementing textual descriptions with image exemplars. A preference-based refinement module is hence applied to fuse uni-modal and multi-modal classifiers with the aim to alleviate issues of low-quality exemplar images or textual descriptions. The proposed OVMR is a plug-and-play module and works well with exemplar images randomly crawled from the Internet.

Event-based VFI (E-VFI) has recently propelled the advancement of VFI. Thanks to the high temporal resolution benefits event cameras can bridge the informational void present between successive video frames. Most state-of-the-art E-VFI methodologies follow the conventional VFI paradigm which pivots on motion estimation between consecutive frames to generate intermediate frames through a process of warping and refinement. However this reliance engenders a heavy dependency on the quality and consistency of keyframes rendering these methods susceptible to challenges in extreme real-world scenarios such as missing moving objects and severe occlusion dilemmas. This study proposes a novel E-VFI framework that directly synthesize intermediate frames leveraging event-based reference obviating the necessity for explicit motion estimation and substantially enhancing the capacity to handle motion occlusion. Given the sparse and inherently noisy nature of event data we prioritize the reliability of the event-based reference leading to the development of an innovative event-aware reconstruction strategy for accurate reference generation. Besides we implement a bi-directional event-guided alignment from keyframes to the reference using the introduced E-PCD module. Finally a transformer-based decoder is adopted for prediction refinement. Comprehensive experimental evaluations on both synthetic and real-world datasets underscore the superiority of our approach and its potential to execute high-quality VFI tasks."},

In this paper we propose an efficient convolution module for SAR object detection called SFS-Conv which increases feature diversity within each convolutional layer through a shunt-perceive-select strategy. Specifically we shunt input feature maps into space and frequency aspects. The former perceives the context of various objects by dynamically adjusting receptive field while the latter captures abundant frequency variations and textural features via fractional Gabor transformer. To adaptively fuse features from space and frequency aspects a parameter-free feature selection module is proposed to ensure that the most representative and distinctive information are preserved. With SFS-Conv we build a lightweight SAR object detection network called SFS-CNet. Experimental results show that SFS-CNet outperforms state-of-the-art (SoTA) models on a series of SAR object detection benchmarks while simultaneously reducing both the model size and computational cost."},

Unlike prior retrieval-based diffusion models that require long forward-reverse diffusion paths READ directly diffuses between the source (retrieved) and target motions resulting in an efficient diffusion path. A second contribution of READ is its use of asymmetric diffusion whereby it preserves the kinematic feasibility of the generated motion by forward diffusion in a low-dimensional latent space while achieving high-resolution motion by reverse diffusion in the original task space using cold diffusion. Experimental results on various manipulation tasks demonstrate that READ outperforms state-of-the-art planning methods while ablation studies elucidate the contributions of asymmetric diffusion."},

We present a novel approach ESR-NeRF leveraging neural networks as learnable functions to represent ray-traced fields. By training networks to satisfy light transport segments we regulate outgoing radiances progressively identifying emissive sources while being aware of reflection areas. The results on scenes encompassing emissive sources with various properties demonstrate the superiority of ESR-NeRF in qualitative and quantitative ways.

To exploit unlabeled data for model training semi-supervised learning methods attempt to construct pseudo labels or various auxiliary constraints as supervision signals. However most of them just process video data as a set of independent images in a per-frame manner. The rich temporal relationships are ignored which can serve as valuable clues for representation learning. Besides this per-frame recognition paradigm is quite different from that of humans. Actually benefited from the internal temporal relevance of video data human would wisely use the distinguished semantic concepts in historical frames to aid the recognition of the current frame. Motivated by this observation we propose a novel temporally-dependent classifier (TDC) to mimic the human-like recognition procedure. Comparing to the conventional classifier TDC can guide the model to learn a group of temporally-consistent semantic concepts across frames which essentially provides an implicit and effective constraint.

However the ease of image manipulation has raised ethical concerns with the potential for malicious use in generating deceptive or harmful content. To address the concerns we propose an image immunization approach named semantic attack to protect our images from being manipulated by malicious agents using diffusion models. Our approach focuses on disrupting the semantic understanding of T2I diffusion models regarding specific content. By attacking the cross-attention mechanism that encodes image features with text messages during editing we distract the model's attention regarding the content of our concern. Our semantic attack renders the model uncertain about the areas to edit resulting in poorly edited images and contradicting the malicious editing attempts. In addition by shifting the attack target towards intermediate attention maps from the final generated image our approach substantially diminishes computational burden and alleviates GPU memory constraints in comparison to previous methods. Moreover we introduce timestep universal gradient updating to create timestep-agnostic perturbations effective across different input noise levels. By treating the full diffusion process as discrete denoising timesteps during the attack we achieve equivalent or even superior immunization efficacy with nearly half the memory consumption of the previous method. Our contributions include a practical and effective approach to safeguard images against malicious editing and the proposed method offers robust immunization against various image inpainting and editing approaches showcasing its potential for real-world applications."},

To address these challenges we propose SAS-Det that tames self-training for OVD from two key perspectives.

Specifically we propose a Rotation-Modulated Relational Graph Matching method to match relations of proposals centered on annotated points between different models to alleviate the ambiguity of point annotations in depicting the oriented object. In addition we further propose a Relational Rank Distribution Matching method to align the rank distribution on classification and regression between different models. Finally to handle the difficult annotated points that both models are confused about we introduce weakly supervised learning to impose positive signals for difficult point-induced clusters to the base model and focus the base model on the occupancy between the predictions and annotated points.

Existing methods usually require 3D occupancy labels to produce meaningful results. However it is very laborious to annotate the occupancy status of each voxel. In this paper we propose SelfOcc to explore a self-supervised way to learn 3D occupancy using only video sequences. We first transform the images into the 3D space (e.g. bird's eye view) to obtain 3D representation of the scene. We directly impose constraints on the 3D representations by treating them as signed distance fields. We can then render 2D images of previous and future frames as self-supervision signals to learn the 3D representations. We propose an MVS-embedded strategy to directly optimize the SDF-induced weights with multiple depth proposals. Our SelfOcc outperforms the previous best method SceneRF by 58.7% using a single frame as input on SemanticKITTI and is the first self-supervised work that produces reasonable 3D occupancy for surround cameras on nuScenes. SelfOcc produces high-quality depth and achieves state-of-the-art results on novel depth synthesis monocular depth estimation and surround-view depth estimation on the SemanticKITTI KITTI-2015 and nuScenes respectively.

For video generation various open-sourced models and public-available services have been developed to generate high-quality videos. However these methods often use a few metrics e.g. FVD or IS to evaluate the performance. We argue that it is hard to judge the large conditional generative models from the simple metrics since these models are often trained on very large datasets with multi-aspect abilities. Thus we propose a novel framework and pipeline for exhaustively evaluating the performance of the generated videos. Our approach involves generating a diverse and comprehensive list of 700 prompts for text-to-video generation which is based on an analysis of real-world user data and generated with the assistance of a large language model. Then we evaluate the state-of-the-art video generative models on our carefully designed benchmark in terms of visual qualities content qualities motion qualities and text-video alignment with 17 well-selected objective metrics. To obtain the final leaderboard of the models we further fit a series of coefficients to align the objective metrics to the users' opinions. Based on the proposed human alignment method our final score shows a higher correlation than simply averaging the metrics showing the effectiveness of the proposed evaluation method."},

However a realistic threat model was recently developed by leveraging memory fault to inject Trojans at the inference stage. In this work we develop a novel Trojan attack by adopting a unique memory fault injection technique that can inject bit-flip into the page table of the main memory. In the main memory each weight block consists of a group of weights located at a specific address of a DRAM row. A bit-flip in the page frame number replaces a target weight block of a DNN model with another replacement weight block. To develop a successful Trojan attack leveraging this unique fault model the attacker must solve three key challenges: i) how to identify a minimum set of target weight blocks to be modified? ii) how to identify the corresponding optimal replacement weight block? iii) how to optimize the trigger to maximize the attacker's objective given a target and replacement weight block set? We address them by proposing a novel Deep-TROJ attack algorithm that can identify a minimum set of vulnerable target and corresponding replacement weight blocks while optimizing the trigger at the same time. We evaluate the performance of our proposed Deep-TROJ on CIFAR-10 CIFAR-100 and ImageNet dataset for sixteen different DNN architectures including vision transformers. Proposed Deep-TROJ is the most successful one to date that does not require access to training facilities while successfully bypassing the existing defenses.

Multiple views provide more information than single views and thus existing MVC methods can achieve satisfactory performance. However their performance might seriously degenerate when the views are noisy in practical multi-view scenarios. In this paper we formally investigate the drawback of noisy views and then propose a theoretically grounded deep MVC method (namely MVCAN) to address this issue. Specifically we propose a novel MVC objective that enables un-shared parameters and inconsistent clustering predictions across multiple views to reduce the side effects of noisy views. Furthermore a two-level multi-view iterative optimization is designed to generate robust learning targets for refining individual views' representation learning. Theoretical analysis reveals that MVCAN works by achieving the multi-view consistency complementarity and noise robustness. Finally experiments on extensive public datasets demonstrate that MVCAN outperforms state-of-the-art methods and is robust against the existence of noisy views."},

However the existing NBV policies heavily rely on hand-crafted criteria limited action space or per-scene optimized representations. These constraints limit their cross-dataset generalizability. To overcome them we propose GenNBV an end-to-end generalizable NBV policy. Our policy adopts a reinforcement learning (RL)-based framework and extends typical limited action space to 5D free space. It empowers our agent drone to scan from any viewpoint and even interact with unseen geometries during training. To boost the cross-dataset generalizability we also propose a novel multi-source state embedding including geometric semantic and action representations. We establish a benchmark using the Isaac Gym simulator with the Houses3K and OmniObject3D datasets to evaluate this NBV policy.

{"title": "An N-Point Linear Solver for Line and Motion Estimation with Event Cameras", "authors": "Ling Gao, Daniel Gehrig, Hang Su, Davide Scaramuzza, Laurent Kneip", "abstract": "Event cameras respond primarily to edges---formed by strong gradients---and are thus particularly well-suited for line-based motion estimation. Recent work has shown that events generated by a single line each satisfy a polynomial constraint which describes a manifold in the space-time volume. Multiple such constraints can be solved simultaneously to recover the partial linear velocity and line parameters. In this work we show that with a suitable line parametrization this system of constraints is actually linear in the unknowns which allows us to design a novel linear solver. Unlike existing solvers our linear solver (i) is fast and numerically stable since it does not rely on expensive root finding (ii) can solve both minimal and overdetermined systems with more than 5 events and (iii) admits the characterization of all degenerate cases and multiple solutions. The found line parameters are singularity-free and have a fixed scale which eliminates the need for auxiliary constraints typically encountered in previous work. To recover the full linear camera velocity we fuse observations from multiple lines with a novel velocity averaging scheme that relies on a geometrically-motivated residual and thus solves the problem more efficiently than previous schemes which minimize an algebraic residual. Extensive experiments in synthetic and real-world settings demonstrate that our method surpasses the previous work in numerical stability and operates over 600 times faster."},

To bridge this gap we present URHand the first universal relightable hand model that generalizes across viewpoints poses illuminations and identities. Our model allows few-shot personalization using images captured with a mobile phone and is ready to be photorealistically rendered under novel illuminations. To simplify the personalization process while retaining photorealism we build a powerful universal relightable prior based on neural relighting from multi-view images of hands captured in a light stage with hundreds of identities. The key challenge is scaling the cross-identity training while maintaining personalized fidelity and sharp details without compromising generalization under natural illuminations. To this end we propose a spatially varying linear lighting model as the neural renderer that takes physics-inspired shading as input feature. By removing non-linear activations and bias our specifically designed lighting model explicitly keeps the linearity of light transport. This enables single-stage training from light-stage data while generalizing to real-time rendering under arbitrary continuous illuminations across diverse identities. In addition we introduce the joint learning of a physically based model and our neural relighting model which further improves fidelity and generalization. Extensive experiments show that our approach achieves superior performance over existing methods in terms of both quality and generalizability.

Many methods have been explored to enhance tracking performance by incorporating tracking history to better handle scenarios involving target appearance variations such as deformation and occlusion. However the utilization of historical information in existing methods is insufficient and incomprehensive which typically requires repetitive training and introduces a large amount of computation. In this paper we show that by providing a tracker that follows Siamese paradigm with precise and updated historical information a significant performance improvement can be achieved with completely unchanged parameters. Based on this we propose a historical prompt network that uses refined historical foreground masks and historical visual features of the target to provide comprehensive and precise prompts for the tracker. We build a novel tracker called HIPTrack based on the historical prompt network which achieves considerable performance improvements without the need to retrain the entire model. We conduct experiments on seven datasets and experimental results demonstrate that our method surpasses the current state-of-the-art trackers on LaSOT LaSOText GOT-10k and NfS.

Unlike most existing approaches we propose a Spatial-Temporal Expectation-Maximization (STEM) inversion which formulates the dense video feature under an expectation-maximization manner and iteratively estimates a more compact basis set to represent the whole video. Each frame applies the fixed and global representation for inversion which is more friendly for temporal consistency during reconstruction and editing.

Since the environment layout is unknown the agent needs to infer the unknown contextual objects from partially observations thereby deducing the likely location of the target. Previous end-to-end RL methods capture contextual relationships through implicit representations while they lack notion of geometry. Alternatively modular methods construct local maps for recording the observed geometric structure of unseen environment however lacking the reasoning of contextual relation limits the exploration efficiency. In this work we propose the self-supervised generative map (SGM) a modular method that learns the explicit context relation via self-supervised learning. The SGM is trained to leverage both episodic observations and general knowledge to reconstruct the masked pixels of a cropped global map. During navigation the agent maintains an incomplete local semantic map meanwhile the unknown regions of the local map are generated by the pre-trained SGM. Based on the generated map the agent sets the predicted location of the target as the goal and moves towards it. Experiments on Gibson MP3D and HM3D show the effectiveness of our method."},

Existing methods address this issue mostly by fine-tuning the model with extra images or adding additional controls --- human-centric priors such as pose or depth maps --- during the image generation phase. This paper explores the integration of these human-centric priors directly into the model fine-tuning stage essentially eliminating the need for extra conditions at the inference stage. We realize this idea by proposing a human-centric alignment loss to strengthen human-related information from the textual prompts within the cross-attention maps. To ensure semantic detail richness and human structural accuracy during fine-tuning we introduce scale-aware and step-wise constraints within the diffusion process according to an in-depth analysis of the cross-attention layer. Extensive experiments show that our method largely improves over state-of-the-art text-to-image models to synthesize high-quality human images based on user-written prompts."},

However existing self-supervised methods for this problem assume perfect input shape alignment restricting their real-world applicability. In this work we introduce a novel self-supervised Rotation-Invariant 3D correspondence learner with Local Shape Transform dubbed RIST that learns to establish dense correspondences between shapes even under challenging intra-class variations and arbitrary orientations. Specifically RIST learns to dynamically formulate an SO(3)-invariant local shape transform for each point which maps the SO(3)-equivariant global shape descriptor of the input shape to a local shape descriptor. These local shape descriptors are provided as inputs to our decoder to facilitate point cloud self- and cross-reconstruction. Our proposed self-supervised training pipeline encourages semantically corresponding points from different shapes to be mapped to similar local shape descriptors enabling RIST to establish dense point-wise correspondences. RIST demonstrates state-of-the-art performances on 3D part label transfer and semantic keypoint transfer given arbitrarily rotated point cloud pairs outperforming existing methods by significant margins."},

Gaussian Splatting has recently become very popular as it yields realistic rendering while being significantly faster to train than NeRFs. It is however challenging to extract a mesh from the millions of tiny 3D Gaussians as these Gaussians tend to be unorganized after optimization and no method has been proposed so far. Our first key contribution is a regularization term that encourages the Gaussians to align well with the surface of the scene. We then introduce a method that exploits this alignment to extract a mesh from the Gaussians using Poisson reconstruction which is fast scalable and preserves details in contrast to the Marching Cubes algorithm usually applied to extract meshes from Neural SDFs. Finally we introduce an optional refinement strategy that binds Gaussians to the surface of the mesh and jointly optimizes these Gaussians and the mesh through Gaussian splatting rendering. This enables easy editing sculpting animating and relighting of the Gaussians by manipulating the mesh instead of the Gaussians themselves. Retrieving such an editable mesh for realistic rendering is done within minutes with our method compared to hours with the state-of-the-art method on SDFs while providing a better rendering quality."},

Current methods optimize the pose and shape parameters with a reprojection loss on the provided 2D keypoints. Such an approach while simple and intuitive has limited effectiveness because the optimal solution is hard to find in ambiguous parameter space and may sacrifice depth. Additionally divergent gradients from distal joints complicate and deviate the refinement of proximal joints in the kinematic chain. To address these we introduce Kinematic-Tree Rotation (KITRO) a novel mesh refinement strategy that explicitly models depth and human kinematic-tree structure. KITRO treats refinement from a bone-wise perspective. Unlike previous methods which perform gradient-based optimizations our method calculates bone directions in closed form. By accounting for the 2D pose bone length and parent joint's depth the calculation results in two possible directions for each child joint. We then use a decision tree to trace binary choices for all bones along the human skeleton's kinematic-tree to select the most probable hypothesis.

Nevertheless the problem is not trivial when shaping diffusion models to animate static image (i.e. image-to-video generation). The difficulty originates from the aspect that the diffusion process of subsequent animated frames should not only preserve the faithful alignment with the given image but also pursue temporal coherence among adjacent frames. To alleviate this we present TRIP a new recipe of image-to-video diffusion paradigm that pivots on image noise prior derived from static image to jointly trigger inter-frame relational reasoning and ease the coherent temporal modeling via temporal residual learning. Technically the image noise prior is first attained through one-step backward diffusion process based on both static image and noised video latent codes. Next TRIP executes a residual-like dual-path scheme for noise prediction: 1) a shortcut path that directly takes image noise prior as the reference noise of each frame to amplify the alignment between the first frame and subsequent frames; 2) a residual path that employs 3D-UNet over noised video and static image latent codes to enable inter-frame relational reasoning thereby easing the learning of the residual noise for each frame. Furthermore both reference and residual noise of each frame are dynamically merged via attention mechanism for final video generation.

Then we construct pairs of human poses and texture maps to establish a texture vocabulary for encoding dynamic human appearances under various poses. Unlike the commonly used joint-wise manner we further design a body-part-wise encoding strategy to learn the structural effects of the kinematic chain. Given a driving pose we query the pose feature hierarchically by decomposing the pose vector into several body parts and interpolating the texture features for synthesizing fine-grained human dynamics.

However producing BW photography often demands high-end cameras or photographic editing from experts. Even the experts prefer different styles depending on the subject or even the same subject when taking grayscale photos or converting color images to BW. It is thus questionable which approach is better. To imitate the artistic values of decolorized images this paper introduces a deep metric learning framework with a novel subject-style specified proxy and a large-scale BW dataset. Our proxy-based decolorization utilizes a hierarchical proxy-based loss and a hierarchical bilateral grid network to mimic the experts' retouching scheme. The proxy-based loss captures both expert-discriminative and classsharing characteristics while the hierarchical bilateral grid network enables imitating spatially-variant retouching by considering both global and local scene contexts. Our dataset including color and BW images edited by three experts demonstrates the scalability of our method which can be further enhanced by constructing additional proxies from any set of BW photos like Internet downloaded figures.

Ideally AD models should be able to detect defects over many image classes; without relying on hard-coded class names that can be uninformative or inconsistent across datasets; learn without anomaly supervision; and be robust to the long-tailed distributions of real-world applications. To address these challenges we formulate the problem of long-tailed AD by introducing several datasets with different levels of class imbalance and metrics for performance evaluation. We then propose a novel method LTAD to detect defects from multiple and long-tailed classes without relying on dataset class names. LTAD combines AD by reconstruction and semantic AD modules. AD by reconstruction is implemented with a transformer-based reconstruction module. Semantic AD is implemented with a binary classifier which relies on learned pseudo class names and a pretrained foundation model. These modules are learned over two phases. Phase 1 learns the pseudo-class names and a variational autoencoder (VAE) for feature synthesis that augments the training data to combat long-tails. Phase 2 then learns the parameters of the reconstruction and classification modules of LTAD.

We make the following three contributions: (i) to fulfill the task of visual storytelling we propose a learning-based auto-regressive image generation model termed as StoryGen with a novel vision-language context module that enables to generate the current frame by conditioning on the corresponding text prompt and preceding image-caption pairs; (ii) to address the data shortage of visual storytelling we collect paired image-text sequences by sourcing from online videos and open-source E-books establishing processing pipeline for constructing a large-scale dataset with diverse characters storylines and artistic styles named StorySalon; (iii) Quantitative experiments and human evaluations have validated the superiority of our StoryGen where we show it can generalize to unseen characters without any optimization and generate image sequences with coherent content and consistent character.

However when applied to the task of single-view 3D clothed human reconstruction Zero-1-to-3 (and related models) are unable to compete with the corresponding SOTA methods in this field despite being trained on clothed human data. In this work we aim to tailor Zero-1-to-3's approach to the single-view 3D clothed human reconstruction task in a much more principled and structured manner. To this end we propose R-Cyclic Diffuser a framework that adapts Zero-1-to-3's novel approach to clothed human data by fusing it with a pixel-aligned implicit model. R-Cyclic Diffuser offers a total of three new contributions. The first and primary contribution is R-Cyclic Diffuser's cyclical conditioning mechanism for novel view synthesis. This mechanism directly addresses the view inconsistency problem faced by Zero-1-to-3 and related models. Secondly we further enhance this mechanism with two key features - Lateral Inversion Constraint and Cyclic Noise Selection. Both features are designed to regularize and restrict the randomness of outputs generated by a latent diffusion model. Thirdly we show how SMPL-X body priors can be incorporated in a latent diffusion model such that novel views of clothed human bodies can be generated much more accurately. Our experiments show that R-Cyclic Diffuser is able to outperform current SOTA methods in single-view 3D clothed human reconstruction both qualitatively and quantitatively.

This results in significant performance degradation under small skeleton perturbations or changing the pose estimator between training and testing. In this work we introduce MaskCLR a new Masked Contrastive Learning approach for Robust skeletal action recognition. We propose an Attention-Guided Probabilistic Masking strategy to occlude the most important joints and encourage the model to explore a larger set of discriminative joints. Furthermore we propose a Multi-Level Contrastive Learning paradigm to enforce the representations of standard and occluded skeletons to be class-discriminative i.e. more compact within each class and more dispersed across different classes. Our approach helps the model capture the high-level action semantics instead of low-level joint variations and can be conveniently incorporated into transformer-based models. Without loss of generality we combine MaskCLR with three transformer backbones: the vanilla transformer DSTFormer and STTFormer. Extensive experiments on NTU60 NTU120 and Kinetics400 show that MaskCLR consistently outperforms previous state-of-the-art methods on standard and perturbed skeletons from different pose estimators showing improved accuracy generalization and robustness.

{"title": "Narrative Action Evaluation with Prompt-Guided Multimodal Interaction", "authors": "Shiyi Zhang, Sule Bai, Guangyi Chen, Lei Chen, Jiwen Lu, Junle Wang, Yansong Tang", "abstract": "In this paper we investigate a new problem called narrative action evaluation (NAE). NAE aims to generate professional commentary that evaluates the execution of an action. Unlike traditional tasks such as score-based action quality assessment and video captioning involving superficial sentences NAE focuses on creating detailed narratives in natural language. These narratives provide intricate descriptions of actions along with objective evaluations. NAE is a more challenging task because it requires both narrative flexibility and evaluation rigor. One existing possible solution is to use multi-task learning where narrative language and evaluative information are predicted separately. However this approach results in reduced performance for individual tasks because of variations between tasks and differences in modality between language information and evaluation information. To address this we propose a prompt-guided multimodal interaction framework. This framework utilizes a pair of transformers to facilitate the interaction between different modalities of information. It also uses prompts to transform the score regression task into a video-text matching task thus enabling task interactivity. To support further research in this field we re-annotate the MTL-AQA and FineGym datasets with high-quality and comprehensive action narration. Additionally we establish benchmarks for NAE. Extensive experiment results prove that our method outperforms separate learning methods and naive multi-task learning methods.

Tong, Ka Chun Cheung, Simon See", "abstract": "Automatic radiology report generation using deep learning models has been recently explored and found promising. Neural decoders are commonly used for the report generation where irrelevant and unfaithful contents are unavoidable. The retrieval-based approach alleviates the limitation by identifying reports which are relevant to the input to assist the generation. To achieve clinically accurate report retrieval we make reference to clinicians' diagnostic steps of examining a radiology image where anatomical and diagnostic details are typically focused and propose a novel hierarchical visual concept representation called anatomy-aware hierarchical vision encoding (AHIVE). To learn AHIVE we first derive a methodology to extract hierarchical diagnostic descriptions from radiology reports and develop a CLIP-based framework for the model training. Also the hierarchical architecture of AHIVE is designed to support interactive report retrieval so that report revision made at one layer can be propagated to the subsequent ones to trigger other necessary revisions. We conduct extensive experiments and show that AHIVE can outperform the SOTA vision-language retrieval methods in terms of clinical accuracy by a large margin. We provide also a case study to illustrate how it enables interactive report retrieval."},

However due to the randomness in the diffusion process they often struggle with handling diverse low-level tasks that require details preservation. To overcome this limitation we present a new Diff-Plugin framework to enable a single pre-trained diffusion model to generate high-fidelity results across a variety of low-level tasks. Specifically we first propose a lightweight Task-Plugin module with a dual branch design to provide task-specific priors guiding the diffusion process in preserving image content. We then propose a Plugin-Selector that can automatically select different Task-Plugins based on the text instruction allowing users to edit images by indicating multiple low-level tasks with natural language. We conduct extensive experiments on 8 low-level vision tasks. The results demonstrate the superiority of Diff-Plugin over existing methods particularly in real-world scenarios.

On the one hand large language models (LLM) have shown impressive reasoning capabilities that approach \"Artificial General Intelligence\".

To this end this paper introduces LMDrive a novel language-guided end-to-end closed-loop autonomous driving framework. LMDrive uniquely processes and integrates multi-modal sensor data with natural language instructions enabling interaction with humans and navigation software in realistic instructional settings. To facilitate further research in language-based closed-loop autonomous driving we also publicly release the corresponding dataset which includes approximately 64K instruction-following data clips and the LangAuto benchmark that tests the system's ability to handle complex instructions and challenging driving scenarios.

Our generative 3D avatar enables disentangled controls to selectively alter the facial attributes (e.g. hair or nose) while preserving the identity. Our approach consists of two stages: synthetic database generation and constructing a personalized generative avatar. We generate a synthetic video collection of the target identity with varying facial attributes where the videos are synthesized by borrowing the attributes from monocular videos of diverse identities. Then we build a person-specific generative 3D avatar that can modify its attributes continuously while preserving its identity. Through extensive experiments we demonstrate that our method of generating a synthetic database and creating a 3D generative avatar is the most effective in preserving identity while achieving high realism. Subsequently we introduce a zero-shot approach to achieve the same goal of generative modeling more efficiently by leveraging a previously constructed personalized generative model."},

Scene Coordinate Regression (SCR) has demonstrated state-of-the-art performance in this task. In SCR a scene is represented as a neural network which outputs the world coordinates for each point in the input point cloud. However SCR treats all points equally during localization ignoring the fact that not all objects are beneficial for localization. For example dynamic objects and repeating structures often negatively impact SCR. To address this problem we introduce LiSA the first method that incorporates semantic awareness into SCR to boost the localization robustness and accuracy. To avoid extra computation or network parameters during inference we distill the knowledge from a segmentation model to the original SCR network. Experiments show the superior performance of LiSA on standard LiDAR localization benchmarks compared to state-of-the-art methods. Applying knowledge distillation not only preserves high efficiency but also achieves higher localization accuracy than introducing extra semantic segmentation modules. We also analyze the benefit of semantic information for LiDAR localization. Our code is released at https://github.com/Ybchun/LiSA."},
{"title": "MMM: Generative Masked Motion Model", "authors": "Ekkasit Pinyoanuntapong, Pu Wang, Minwoo Lee, Chen Chen", "abstract": "Recent advances in text-to-motion generation using diffusion and autoregressive models have shown promising results. However these models often suffer from a trade-off between real-time performance high fidelity and motion editability. To address this gap we introduce MMM a novel yet simple motion generation paradigm based on Masked Motion Model. MMM consists of two key components: (1) a motion tokenizer that transforms 3D human motion into a sequence of discrete tokens in latent space and (2) a conditional masked motion transformer that learns to predict randomly masked motion tokens conditioned on the pre-computed text tokens. By attending to motion and text tokens in all directions MMM explicitly captures inherent dependency among motion tokens and semantic mapping between motion and text tokens. During inference this allows parallel and iterative decoding of multiple motion tokens that are highly consistent with fine-grained text descriptions therefore simultaneously achieving high-fidelity and high-speed motion generation. In addition MMM has innate motion editability. By simply placing mask tokens in the place that needs editing MMM automatically fills the gaps while guaranteeing smooth transitions between editing and non-editing parts. Extensive experiments on the HumanML3D and KIT-ML datasets demonstrate that MMM surpasses current leading methods in generating high-quality motion (evidenced by superior FID scores of 0.08 and 0.429) while offering advanced editing features such as body-part modification motion in-betweening and the synthesis of long motion sequences. In addition MMM is two orders of magnitude faster on a single mid-range GPU than editable motion diffusion models. Our project page is available at https://exitudio.github.io/MMM-page/."},

Duncan", "abstract": "Fine-tuning pre-trained vision-language models like CLIP has yielded success on diverse downstream tasks. However several pain points persist for this paradigm: (i) directly tuning entire pre-trained models becomes both time-intensive and computationally costly. Additionally these tuned models tend to become highly specialized limiting their practicality for real-world deployment; (ii) recent studies indicate that pre-trained vision-language classifiers may overly depend on spurious features -- patterns that correlate with the target in training data but are not related to the true labeling function; and (iii) existing studies on mitigating the reliance on spurious features largely based on the assumption that we can identify such features does not provide definitive assurance for real-world applications. As a piloting study this work focuses on exploring mitigating the reliance on spurious features for CLIP without using any group annotation. To this end we systematically study the existence of spurious correlation on CLIP and CILP+ERM. We first following recent work on Deep Feature Reweighting (DFR) verify that last-layer retraining can greatly improve group robustness on pretrained CLIP. In view of them we advocate a lightweight representation calibration method for fine-tuning CLIP by first generating a calibration set using the pretrained CLIP and then calibrating representations of samples within this set through contrastive learning all without the need for group labels. Extensive experiments and in-depth visualizations on several benchmarks validate the effectiveness of our proposals largely reducing reliance and significantly boosting the model generalization."},
{"title": "Plug and Play Active Learning for Object Detection", "authors": "Chenhongyi Yang, Lichao Huang, Elliot J. Crowley", "abstract": "Annotating datasets for object detection is an expensive and time-consuming endeavor. To minimize this burden active learning (AL) techniques are employed to select the most informative samples for annotation within a constrained \"annotation budget\". Traditional AL strategies typically rely on model uncertainty or sample diversity for query sampling while more advanced methods have focused on developing AL-specific object detector architectures to enhance performance. However these specialized approaches are not readily adaptable to different object detectors due to the significant engineering effort required for integration. To overcome this challenge we introduce Plug and Play Active Learning (PPAL) a simple and effective AL strategy for object detection. PPAL is a two-stage method comprising uncertainty-based and diversity-based sampling phases. In the first stage our Difficulty Calibrated Uncertainty Sampling leverage a category-wise difficulty coefficient that combines both classification and localisation difficulties to re-weight instance uncertainties from which we sample a candidate pool for the subsequent diversity-based sampling. In the second stage we propose Category Conditioned Matching Similarity to better compute the similarities of multi-instance images as ensembles of their instance similarities which is used by the k-Means++ algorithm to sample the final AL queries. PPAL makes no change to model architectures or detector training pipelines; hence it can be easily generalized to different object detectors. We benchmark PPAL on the MS-COCO and Pascal VOC datasets using different detector architectures and show that our method outperforms prior work by a large margin.

In contrast to existing approaches in our setting (i) the object of interest is specified solely through the textual prompt (ii) no object model (e.g. CAD or video sequence) is required at inference and (iii) the object is imaged from two RGBD viewpoints of different scenes. To operate in this setting we introduce a novel approach that leverages a Vision-Language Model to segment the object of interest from the scenes and to estimate its relative 6D pose. The key of our approach is a carefully devised strategy to fuse object-level information provided by the prompt with local image features resulting in a feature space that can generalize to novel concepts. We validate our approach on a new benchmark based on two popular datasets REAL275 and Toyota-Light which collectively encompass 34 object instances appearing in four thousand image pairs.

A flexible scheme is to tackle the optical aberration of low-end lenses computationally. However it is highly demanded but quite challenging to build a general model capable of handling non-stationary aberrations and covering diverse lenses especially in a blind manner. To address this issue we propose a universal solution by extensively utilizing the physical properties of camera lenses: (i) reducing the complexity of lens aberrations i.e. lens-specific non-stationary blur by warping annual-ring-shaped sub-images into rectangular stripes to transform non-uniform degenerations into a uniform one (ii) building a low-dimensional non-negative orthogonal representation of lens blur kernels to cover diverse lenses; (iii) designing a decoupling network to decompose the input low-quality image into several components degenerated by above kernel bases and applying corresponding pre-trained deconvolution networks to reverse the degeneration. Benefiting from the proper incorporation of lenses' physical properties and unique network design the proposed method achieves superb imaging quality wide applicability for various lenses high running efficiency and is totally free of kernel calibration. These advantages bring great potential for scenarios requiring lightweight high-quality photography."},

One way of approaching a problem of such scale is using dual encoder models (e.g. CLIP) where all the entity names and query images are embedded into a unified space paving the way for an approximate kNN search. Alternatively it is also possible to re-purpose a captioning model to directly generate the entity names for a given image. In contrast we introduce a novel Generative Entity Recognition (GER) framework which given an input image learns to auto-regressively decode a semantic and discriminative \"code\" identifying the target entity.

In real-world scenarios erasure requests originate at any time from both users and model owners. These requests usually form a sequence. Therefore under such a setting selective information is expected to be continuously removed from a pre-trained model while maintaining the rest. We define this problem as continual forgetting and identify two key challenges. (i) For unwanted knowledge efficient and effective deleting is crucial. (ii) For remaining knowledge the impact brought by the forgetting procedure should be minimal. To address them we propose Group Sparse LoRA (GS-LoRA). Specifically towards (i) we use LoRA modules to fine-tune the FFN layers in Transformer blocks for each forgetting task independently and towards (ii) a simple group sparse regularization is adopted enabling automatic selection of specific LoRA groups and zeroing out the others. GS-LoRA is effective parameter-efficient data-efficient and easy to implement.

However we observe that there are cases (e.g. faraway regions) in which popular 2D object detectors are more reliable than state-of-the-art 3D detectors. In this paper to improve the performance of query-based 3D object detectors we present a novel query generating approach termed QAF2D which infers 3D query anchors from 2D detection results. A 2D bounding box of an object in an image is lifted to a set of 3D anchors by associating each sampled point within the box with depth yaw angle and size candidates. Then the validity of each 3D anchor is verified by comparing its projection in the image with its corresponding 2D box and only valid anchors are kept and used to construct queries. The class information of the 2D bounding box associated with each query is also utilized to match the predicted boxes with ground truth for the set-based loss. The image feature extraction backbone is shared between the 3D detector and 2D detector by adding a small number of prompt parameters. We integrate QAF2D into three popular query-based 3D object detectors and carry out comprehensive evaluations on the nuScenes dataset. The largest improvement that QAF2D can bring about on the nuScenes validation subset is 2.3% NDS and 2.7% mAP. Code is available at https://github.com/max-vision/QAF2D."},

However it is challenging to preserve sharp texture details keep the temporal stability and avoid the ghosting artifacts in real-time super-resolution rendering. To address this issue we introduce radiance demodulation to separate the rendered image or radiance into a lighting component and a material component considering the fact that the light component is smoother than the rendered image so that the high-resolution material component with detailed textures can be easily obtained. We perform the super-resolution on the lighting component only and re-modulate it with the high-resolution material component to obtain the final super-resolution image with more texture details. A reliable warping module is proposed by explicitly marking the occluded regions to avoid the ghosting artifacts. To further enhance the temporal stability we design a frame-recurrent neural network and a temporal loss to aggregate the previous and current frames which can better capture the spatial-temporal consistency among reconstructed frames. As a result our method is able to produce temporally stable results in real-time rendering with high-quality details even in the challenging 4 x4 super-resolution scenarios.

To address this we propose the Decoupled Prompt Tuning (DePT) framework which decouples base-specific knowledge from feature channels into an isolated feature space during prompt tuning so as to maximally preserve task-shared knowledge in the original feature space for achieving better zero-shot generalization on new tasks. Importantly our DePT is orthogonal to existing prompt tuning approaches and can enhance them with negligible additional computational cost.

To address these challenges we introduce DreamSalon a noise-guided staged-editing framework uniquely focusing on detailed image manipulations and identity-context preservation. By discerning editing and boosting stages via the frequency and gradient of predicted noises DreamSalon first performs detailed manipulations on specific features in the editing stage guided by high-frequency information and then employs stochastic denoising in the boosting stage to improve image quality.

An agent can achieve such an understanding by either drawing upon episodic memory exemplified by agents on smart glasses or by actively exploring the environment as in the case of mobile robots. We accompany our formulation with OpenEQA -- the first open-vocabulary benchmark dataset for EQA supporting both episodic memory and active exploration use cases. OpenEQA contains over 1600 high-quality human generated questions drawn from over 180 real-world environments. In addition to the dataset we also provide an automatic LLM-powered evaluation protocol that has excellent correlation with human judgement. Using this dataset and evaluation protocol we evaluate several state-of-the-art foundation models including GPT-4V and find that they significantly lag behind human-level performance. Consequently OpenEQA stands out as a straightforward measurable and practically relevant benchmark that poses a considerable challenge to current generation of foundation models. We hope this inspires and stimulates future research at the intersection of Embodied AI conversational agents and world models."},

We first physically model the imaging of industrial materials covered by the film. Considering the specular highlight from the film can be effectively recorded by the polarized camera we build a practical dataset with polarization information containing paired data with and without transparent film. We aim to remove interference from the film (specular highlights and other degradations) with an end-to-end framework. To locate the specular highlight we use an angle estimation network to optimize the polarization angle with the minimized specular highlight. The image with minimized specular highlight is set as a prior for supporting the reconstruction network. Based on the prior and the polarized images the reconstruction network can decouple all degradations from the film. Extensive experiments show that our framework achieves SOTA performance in both image reconstruction and industrial downstream tasks.

This paper proposes a pioneering work Adaptive Patch Exiting Reversible Decoder (AdaRevD) to explore their insufficient decoding capability. By inheriting the weights of the well-trained encoder we refactor a reversible decoder which scales up the single-decoder training to multi-decoder training while remaining GPU memory-friendly. Meanwhile we show that our reversible structure gradually disentangles high-level degradation degree and low-level blur pattern (residual of the blur image and its sharp counterpart) from compact degradation representation. Besides due to the spatially-variant motion blur kernels different blur patches have various deblurring difficulties. We further introduce a classifier to learn the degradation degree of image patches enabling them to exit at different sub-decoders for speedup. Experiments show that our AdaRevD pushes the limit of image deblurring e.g. achieving 34.60 dB in PSNR on GoPro dataset."},

Traditional SfM systems typically rely on the successful detection of repeatable keypoints across multiple views as the first step which is difficult for texture-poor scenes and poor keypoint detection may break down the whole SfM system. We propose a detector-free SfM framework to draw benefits from the recent success of detector-free matchers to avoid the early determination of keypoints while solving the multi-view inconsistency issue of detector-free matchers. Specifically our framework first reconstructs a coarse SfM model from quantized detector-free matches. Then it refines the model by a novel iterative refinement pipeline which iterates between an attention-based multi-view matching module to refine feature tracks and a geometry refinement module to improve the reconstruction accuracy. Experiments demonstrate that the proposed framework outperforms existing detector-based SfM systems on common benchmark datasets. We also collect a texture-poor SfM dataset to demonstrate the capability of our framework to reconstruct texture-poor scenes.

We model the motion of both human and object in an interdependent fashion as semantically rich human motion rarely happens in isolation without any interactions. Our key insight is that explicitly modeling contact between the human body surface and object geometry can be used as strong proxy guidance both during training and inference. Using this guidance to bridge human and object motion enables generating more realistic and physically plausible interaction sequences where the human body and corresponding object move in a coherent manner. Our method first learns to model human motion object motion and contact in a joint diffusion process inter-correlated through cross-attention. We then leverage this learned contact for guidance during inference to synthesize realistic and coherent HOIs. Extensive evaluation shows that our joint contact-based human-object interaction approach generates realistic and physically plausible sequences and we show two applications highlighting the capabilities of our method. Conditioned on a given object trajectory we can generate the corresponding human motion without re-training demonstrating strong human-object interdependency learning. Our approach is also flexible and can be applied to static real-world 3D scene scans."},

Existing methods are limited to detecting and classifying the predefined events with unsatisfactory semantic understanding although they have obtained considerable performance.

We manually annotate the real-world surveillance dataset UCF-Crime with fine-grained event content and timing. Our newly annotated dataset UCA (UCF-Crime Annotation) contains 23542 sentences with an average length of 20 words and its annotated videos are as long as 110.7 hours. Furthermore we benchmark SOTA models for four multimodal tasks on this newly created dataset which serve as new baselines for surveillance VALU. Through experiments we find that mainstream models used in previously public datasets perform poorly on surveillance video demonstrating new challenges in surveillance VALU.

Spiking Neural Networks (SNNs) inspired by the way the human brain codes and processes information offer a potential solution to these difficulties. However their performance in object detection using event cameras is limited in current implementations. In this paper we propose the Spiking Fusion Object Detector (SFOD) a simple and efficient approach to SNN-based object detection.

Traditional Generative Adversarial Networks (GAN) struggle to maintain consistent facial identity while Neural Radiance Fields (NeRF) methods although they can address this issue often produce mismatched lip movements inadequate facial expressions and unstable head poses. A lifelike talking head requires synchronized coordination of subject identity lip movements facial expressions and head poses. The absence of these synchronizations is a fundamental flaw leading to unrealistic and artificial outcomes. To address the critical issue of synchronization identified as the \"devil\" in creating realistic talking heads we introduce SyncTalk. This NeRF-based method effectively maintains subject identity enhancing synchronization and realism in talking head synthesis. SyncTalk employs a Face-Sync Controller to align lip movements with speech and innovatively uses a 3D facial blendshape model to capture accurate facial expressions. Our HeadSync Stabilizer optimizes head poses achieving more natural head movements. The Portrait-Sync Generator restores hair details and blends the generated head with the torso for a seamless visual experience.

The underlying challenge demands both a discriminating interpretation of language and a comprehensive physics-centric model supporting real-world dynamics. To ameliorate this paper advocates HOIAnimator a novel and interactive diffusion model with perception ability and also ingeniously crafted to revolutionize the animation of complex interactions from linguistic narratives. The effectiveness of our model is anchored in two ground-breaking innovations: (1) Our Perceptive Diffusion Models (PDM) brings together two types of models: one focused on human movements and the other on objects. This combination allows for animations where humans and objects move in concert with each other making the overall motion more realistic. Additionally we propose a Perceptive Message Passing (PMP) mechanism to enhance the communication bridging the two models ensuring that the animations are smooth and unified; (2) We devise an Interaction Contact Field (ICF) a sophisticated model that implicitly captures the essence of HOIs. Beyond mere predictive contact points the ICF assesses the proximity of human and object to their respective environment informed by a probabilistic distribution of interactions learned throughout the denoising phase. Our comprehensive evaluation showcases HOIanimator's superior ability to produce dynamic context-aware animations that surpass existing benchmarks in text-driven animation synthesis."},

First we introduce a novel 2D diffusion model that generates an image consisting of four orthogonal-view sub-images based on the given text prompt. Then the 3D content is created using this diffusion model. Notably the generated orthogonal-view image provides strong geometric structure priors and thus improves 3D consistency. As a result it effectively resolves the Janus problem and significantly enhances the quality of 3D content creation.

Existing methods address this problem with multi-capture HDR sensors and a hardware image signal processor (ISP) that produces a single fused image as input to a downstream neural network. The output of the HDR sensor is a set of low dynamic range (LDR) exposures and the fusion in the ISP is performed in image space and typically optimized for human perception on a display. Preferring tonemapped content with smooth transition regions over detail (and noise) in the resulting image this image fusion does typically not preserve all information from the LDR exposures that may be essential for downstream computer vision tasks. In this work we depart from conventional HDR image fusion and propose a learned task-driven fusion in the feature domain. Instead of using a single companded image we introduce a novel local cross-attention fusion mechanism that exploits semantic features from all exposures learned in an end-to-end fashion with supervision from downstream detection losses. The proposed method outperforms all tested conventional HDR exposure fusion and auto-exposure methods in challenging automotive HDR scenarios."},

However it often suffers from over-reconstruction during Gaussian densification where high-variance image regions are covered by a few large Gaussians only leading to blur and artifacts in the rendered images. We design a progressive frequency regularization (FreGS) technique to tackle the over-reconstruction issue within the frequency space. Specifically FreGS performs coarse-to-fine Gaussian densification by exploiting low-to-high frequency components that can be easily extracted with low-pass and high-pass filters in the Fourier space. By minimizing the discrepancy between the frequency spectrum of the rendered image and the corresponding ground truth it achieves high-quality Gaussian densification and alleviates the over-reconstruction of Gaussian splatting effectively. Experiments over multiple widely adopted benchmarks (e.g. Mip-NeRF360 Tanks-and-Temples and Deep Blending) show that FreGS achieves superior novel view synthesis and outperforms the state-of-the-art consistently."},

This oversight not only limits their generalization to unseen objects but more importantly hinders their synergy with large language models (LLMs) which are excellent task planners that can decompose an overarching command into agent-actionable instructions. With this regard we propose a novel task Language-guided Affordance Segmentation on 3D Object (LASO) which challenges a model to segment a 3D object's part relevant to a given affordance question. To facilitate the task we contribute a dataset comprising 19751 point-question pairs covering 8434 object shapes and 870 expert-crafted questions. As a pioneer solution we further propose PointRefer which highlights an adaptive fusion module to identify target affordance regions at different scales. To ensure a text-aware segmentation we adopt a set of affordance queries conditioned on linguistic cues to generate dynamic kernels. These kernels are further used to convolute with point features and generate a segmentation mask. Comprehensive experiments and analyses validate PointRefer's effectiveness.

Conventional approaches achieve this by transforming perception signals (e.g. bounding boxes segmentation masks) into sequences of discrete tokens which struggle with the precision errors and introduces further complexities for training. In this paper we present a novel end-to-end framework named PerceptionGPT which represent the perception signals using LLM's dynamic token embedding. Specifically we leverage lightweight encoders and decoders to handle the perception signals in LLM's embedding space which takes advantage of the representation power of the high-dimensional token embeddings. Our approach significantly eases the training difficulties associated with the discrete representations in prior methods. Furthermore owing to our compact representation the inference speed is also greatly boosted. Consequently PerceptionGPT enables accurate flexible and efficient handling of complex perception signals.

While these models can achieve high-quality lip articulation for speakers in the training set they are unable to capture the full and diverse distribution of 3D facial motions that accompany speech in the real world. Importantly the relationship between speech and facial motion is one-to-many containing both inter-speaker and intra-speaker variations and necessitating a probabilistic approach. In this paper we identify and address key challenges that have so far limited the development of probabilistic models: lack of datasets and metrics that are suitable for training and evaluating them as well as the difficulty of designing a model that generates diverse results while remaining faithful to a strong conditioning signal as speech. We first propose large-scale benchmark datasets and metrics suitable for probabilistic modeling. Then we demonstrate a probabilistic model that achieves both diversity and fidelity to speech outperforming other methods across the proposed benchmarks.

However current online map estimation approaches are developed in isolation of their downstream tasks complicating their integration in AV stacks. In particular they do not produce uncertainty or confidence estimates. In this work we extend multiple state-of-the-art online map estimation methods to additionally estimate uncertainty and show how this enables more tightly integrating online mapping with trajectory forecasting.

However such general-domain VLMs perform poorly for Remote Sensing (RS) scenarios leading to inaccurate or fabricated information when presented with RS domain-specific queries. Such a behavior emerges due to the unique challenges introduced by RS imagery. For example to handle high-resolution RS imagery with diverse scale changes across categories and many small objects region-level reasoning is necessary alongside holistic scene interpretation. Furthermore the lack of domain-specific multimodal instruction following data as well as strong backbone models for RS make it hard for the models to align their behavior with user queries. To address these limitations we propose GeoChat - the first versatile remote sensing VLM that offers multitask conversational capabilities with high-resolution RS images. Specifically GeoChat can not only answer image-level queries but also accepts region inputs to hold region-specific dialogue. Furthermore it can visually ground objects in its responses by referring to their spatial coordinates. To address the lack of domain-specific datasets we generate a novel RS multimodal instruction-following dataset by extending image-text pairs from existing diverse RS datasets. Leveraging this rich dataset we fine-tune our remote sensing VLM based on the LLaVA-1.5 architecture. We establish a comprehensive benchmark for RS multitask conversations and compare with a number of baseline methods.

Our method takes only a monocular video with a small number of (50-100) frames and it automatically learns to disentangle the static scene and a fully animatable human avatar within 30 minutes. We utilize the SMPL body model to initialize the human Gaussians. To capture details that are not modeled by SMPL (e.g cloth hairs) we allow the 3D Gaussians to deviate from the human body model. Utilizing 3D Gaussians for animated humans brings new challenges including the artifacts created when articulating the Gaussians. We propose to jointly optimize the linear blend skinning weights to coordinate the movements of individual Gaussians during animation.

Recent advancements utilize 3D CNNs to predict a 3D affinity map with improved accuracy but suffer from two challenges: high computational cost and limited input size especially for practical deployment for large-scale EM volumes. To address these challenges we propose a novel method to leverage lightweight 2D CNNs for efficient neuron segmentation. Our method employs a 2D Y-shape network to generate two embedding maps from adjacent 2D sections which are then converted into an affinity map by measuring their embedding distance. While the 2D network better captures pixel dependencies inside sections with larger input sizes it overlooks inter-section dependencies. To overcome this we introduce a cross-dimension affinity distillation (CAD) strategy that transfers inter-section dependency knowledge from a 3D teacher network to the 2D student network by ensuring consistency between their output affinity maps. Additionally we design a feature grafting interaction (FGI) module to enhance knowledge transfer by grafting embedding maps from the 2D student onto those from the 3D teacher.

In this paper we present ViT-Lens that facilitates efficient omni-modal representation learning by perceiving novel modalities with a pretrained ViT and aligning them to a pre-defined space. Specifically the modality-specific lens is tuned to project any-modal signals to an intermediate embedding space which are then processed by a strong ViT with pre-trained visual knowledge. The encoded representations are optimized toward aligning with the modal-independent space pre-defined by off-the-shelf foundation models. ViT-Lens provides a unified solution for representation learning of increasing modalities with two appealing advantages: (i) Unlocking the great potential of pretrained ViTs to novel modalities effectively with efficient data regime; (ii) Enabling emergent downstream capabilities through modality alignment and shared ViT parameters.

Many approaches however assume single light bounce and thus fail to recover challenging scenarios like inter-reflections. On the other hand simply extending those methods to consider multi-bounced light requires more assumptions to alleviate the ambiguity. To address this problem we propose Neural Incident Stokes Fields (NeISF) a multi-view inverse rendering framework that reduces ambiguities using polarization cues. The primary motivation for using polarization cues is that it is the accumulation of multi-bounced light providing rich information about geometry and material. Based on this knowledge the proposed incident Stokes field efficiently models the accumulated polarization effect with the aid of an original physically-based differentiable polarimetric renderer. Lastly experimental results show that our method outperforms the existing works in synthetic and real scenarios."},

In this context we posit that a general unified model can effectively address them all irrespective of the input data type (image 3D etc.). We introduce DiffAssemble a Graph Neural Network (GNN)-based architecture that learns to solve reassembly tasks using a diffusion model formulation. Our method treats the elements of a set whether pieces of 2D patch or 3D object fragments as nodes of a spatial graph. Training is performed by introducing noise into the position and rotation of the elements and iteratively denoising them to reconstruct the coherent initial pose. DiffAssemble achieves state-of-the-art (SOTA) results in most 2D and 3D reassembly tasks and is the first learning-based approach that solves 2D puzzles for both rotation and translation. Furthermore we highlight its remarkable reduction in run-time performing 11 times faster than the quickest optimization-based method for puzzle solving."},

Dalca", "abstract": "Existing learning-based solutions to medical image segmentation have two important shortcomings. First for most new segmentation tasks a new model has to be trained or fine-tuned. This requires extensive resources and machine-learning expertise and is therefore often infeasible for medical researchers and clinicians. Second most existing segmentation methods produce a single deterministic segmentation mask for a given image. In practice however there is often considerable uncertainty about what constitutes the correct segmentation and different expert annotators will often segment the same image differently. We tackle both of these problems with Tyche a framework that uses a context set to generate stochastic predictions for previously unseen tasks without the need to retrain. Tyche differs from other in-context segmentation methods in two important ways. (1) We introduce a novel convolution block architecture that enables interactions among predictions. (2) We introduce in-context test-time augmentation a new mechanism to provide prediction stochasticity. When combined with appropriate model design and loss functions Tyche can predict a set of plausible diverse segmentation candidates for new or unseen medical images and segmentation tasks without the need to retrain.

We propose GenZI the first zero-shot approach to generating 3D human-scene interactions. Key to GenZI is our distillation of interaction priors from large vision-language models (VLMs) which have learned a rich semantic space of 2D human-scene compositions. Given a natural language description and a coarse point location of the desired interaction in a 3D scene we first leverage VLMs to imagine plausible 2D human interactions inpainted into multiple rendered views of the scene. We then formulate a robust iterative optimization to synthesize the pose and shape of a 3D human model in the scene guided by consistency with the 2D interaction hypotheses. In contrast to existing learning-based approaches GenZI circumvents the conventional need for captured 3D interaction data and allows for flexible control of the 3D interaction synthesis with easy-to-use text prompts. Extensive experiments show that our zero-shot approach has high flexibility and generality making it applicable to diverse scene types including both indoor and outdoor environments."},

Existing methods have attempted to accelerate the training of ViTs yet typically disregard method universality with accuracy dropping. Meanwhile they break the training consistency of the original transformers including the consistency of hyper-parameters architecture and strategy which prevents them from being widely applied to different Transformer networks. In this paper we propose a novel token growth scheme Token Expansion (termed ToE) to achieve consistent training acceleration for ViTs. We introduce an \"initialization-expansion-merging\" pipeline to maintain the integrity of the intermediate feature distribution of original transformers preventing the loss of crucial learnable information in the training process. ToE can not only be seamlessly integrated into the training and fine-tuning process of transformers (e.g. DeiT and LV-ViT) but also effective for efficient training frameworks (e.g. EfficientTrain) without twisting the original training hyper-parameters architecture and introducing additional training strategies. Extensive experiments demonstrate that ToE achieves about 1.3x faster for the training of ViTs in a lossless manner or even with performance gains over the full-token training baselines.

PTQ methods for convolutional neural networks (CNNs) provide quantization results comparable to full-precision counterparts. Directly applying them to vision transformers (ViTs) however incurs severe performance degradation mainly due to the differences in architectures between CNNs and ViTs. In particular the distribution of activations for each channel vary drastically according to input instances making PTQ methods for CNNs inappropriate for ViTs. To address this we introduce instance-aware group quantization for ViTs (IGQ-ViT). To this end we propose to split the channels of activation maps into multiple groups dynamically for each input instance such that activations within each group share similar statistical properties. We also extend our scheme to quantize softmax attentions across tokens. In addition the number of groups for each layer is adjusted to minimize the discrepancies between predictions from quantized and full-precision models under a bit-operation (BOP) constraint. We show extensive experimental results on image classification object detection and instance segmentation with various transformer architectures demonstrating the effectiveness of our approach."},

However few studies have investigated the robustness after fine-tuning them in real-world scenarios during which the domain generalization ability can be seriously degraded. In this paper we explore fine-tuning stereo matching networks without compromising their robustness to unseen domains. Our motivation stems from comparing Ground Truth (GT) versus Pseudo Label (PL) for fine-tuning: GT degrades but PL preserves the domain generalization ability. Empirically we find the difference between GT and PL implies valuable information that can regularize networks during fine-tuning. We also propose a framework to utilize this difference for fine-tuning consisting of a frozen Teacher an exponential moving average (EMA) Teacher and a Student network. The core idea is to utilize the EMA Teacher to measure what the Student has learned and dynamically improve GT and PL for fine-tuning. We integrate our framework with state-of-the-art networks and evaluate its effectiveness on several real-world datasets.

On the one hand a location-aware palette guarantees the colors' consistency to entities' locations. On the other hand the progressive dichotomy module can efficiently decode the synthesized colormap to high-quality entity-level masks in a depth-first binary search without knowing the cluster numbers. To tackle the issue of lacking large-scale segmentation training data we employ an inpainting pipeline and then improve the flexibility of diffusion models across various tasks including inpainting image synthesis referring segmentation and entity segmentation.

It is challenging due to variations in pose lighting gender and ethnicity. This task consists of a warping for feature alignment and a blending for a seamless transition between the warped images. We propose to leverage coord-based neural networks to represent such warpings and blendings of face images. During training we exploit the smoothness and flexibility of such networks by combining energy functionals employed in classical approaches without discretizations. Additionally our method is time-dependent allowing a continuous warping/blending of the images. During morphing inference we need both direct and inverse transformations of the time-dependent warping. The first (second) is responsible for warping the target (source) image into the source (target) image. Our neural warping stores those maps in a single network dismissing the need for inverting them. The results of our experiments indicate that our method is competitive with both classical and generative models under the lens of image quality and face-morphing detectors. Aesthetically the resulting images present a seamless blending of diverse faces not yet usual in the literature."},

Diffusion-based adversarial purification uses the diffusion model to generate a clean image against such adversarial attacks. Unfortunately the generative process of the diffusion model is also inevitably affected by adversarial perturbation since the diffusion model is also a deep neural network where its input has adversarial perturbation. In this work we propose MimicDiffusion a new diffusion-based adversarial purification technique that directly approximates the generative process of the diffusion model with the clean image as input. Concretely we analyze the differences between the guided terms using the clean image and the adversarial sample. After that we first implement MimicDiffusion based on Manhattan distance.

Motivated by the prompt tuning we propose scene-adaptive and region-aware multi-modal prompts to address these issues by effectively adapting class-aware knowledge from VLM to the detector at the region level. Specifically to enhance the adaptability to diverse classes we design a scene-adaptive prompt generator from a scene perspective to consider both the commonality and diversity of the class distributions and formulate a novel selection mechanism to facilitate the acquisition of common knowledge across all classes and specific insights relevant to each scene. Meanwhile to bridge the gap between the pre-trained model and the detector we present a region-aware multi-modal alignment module which employs the region prompt to incorporate the positional information for feature distillation and integrates textual prompts to align visual and linguistic representations.

Rather than simply removing such blurring effects recent researches have aimed at decomposing a blurry image into multiple sharp images with spatial and temporal coherence. Since motion blur decomposition itself is highly ambiguous priors from neighbouring frames or human annotation are usually needed for motion disambiguation. In this paper inspired by the complementary exposure characteristics of a global shutter (GS) camera and a rolling shutter (RS) camera we propose to utilize the ordered scanline-wise delay in a rolling shutter image to robustify motion decomposition of a single blurry image. To evaluate this novel dual imaging setting we construct a triaxial system to collect realistic data as well as a deep network architecture that explicitly addresses temporal and contextual information through reciprocal branches for cross-shutter motion blur decomposition. Experiment results have verified the effectiveness of our proposed algorithm as well as the validity of our dual imaging setting."},

In this paper we introduce MTLoRA a novel framework for parameter-efficient training of MTL models. MTLoRA employs Task-Agnostic and Task-Specific Low-Rank Adaptation modules which effectively disentangle the parameter space in MTL fine-tuning thereby enabling the model to adeptly handle both task specialization and interaction within MTL contexts. We applied MTLoRA to hierarchical-transformer-based MTL architectures adapting them to multiple downstream dense prediction tasks. Our extensive experiments on the PASCAL dataset show that MTLoRA achieves higher accuracy on downstream tasks compared to fully fine-tuning the MTL model while reducing the number of trainable parameters by 3.6x. Furthermore MTLoRA establishes a Pareto-optimal trade-off between the number of trainable parameters and the accuracy of the downstream tasks outperforming current state-of-the-art parameter-efficient training methods in both accuracy and efficiency."},

However scaling them to high-resolution inputs is challenging and requires restructuring the diffusion pipeline into multiple independent components limiting scalability and complicating downstream applications. In this work we study patch diffusion models (PDMs) -- a diffusion paradigm which models the distribution of patches rather than whole inputs keeping up to 0.7% of the original pixels. This makes it very efficient during training and unlocks end-to-end optimization on high-resolution videos. We improve PDMs in two principled ways. First to enforce consistency between patches we develop deep context fusion -- an architectural technique that propagates the context information from low-scale to high-scale patches in a hierarchical manner. Second to accelerate training and inference we propose adaptive computation which allocates more network capacity and computation towards coarse image details. The resulting model sets a new state-of-the-art FVD score of 66.32 and Inception Score of 87.68 in class-conditional video generation on UCF-101 256x256 surpassing recent methods by more than 100%.

First we extract the affective cues of the lexicon and verify the extracted one by computing its matching score with video content in terms of sentiment and emotion scores alongside the temporal dimension. Then with the verified cues we propose masked affective modeling to recover temporal emotion distribution. We present temporal affective complementary learning that pulls the complementary part and pushes the intrinsic one of masked multimodal features where the constraint is set with cross-modal attention among features to mask the video and recover the degree of emotion among segments.

They align the distribution differences between domains as encoders without considering their unique characteristics. For instance ViT excels in accuracy due to its superior ability to capture global representations while CNN has an advantage in capturing local representations. This fact has led us to design a hybrid method to fully take advantage of both ViT and CNN called Explicitly Class-specific Boundaries (ECB). ECB learns CNN on ViT to combine their distinct strengths. In particular we leverage ViT's properties to explicitly find class-specific decision boundaries by maximizing the discrepancy between the outputs of the two classifiers to detect target samples far from the source support. In contrast the CNN encoder clusters target features based on the previously defined class-specific boundaries by minimizing the discrepancy between the probabilities of the two classifiers. Finally ViT and CNN mutually exchange knowledge to improve the quality of pseudo labels and reduce the knowledge discrepancies of these models.

We first provide experimental and theoretical analysis to point out that the main challenge in DETR distillation is the lack of consistent distillation points. Distillation points refer to the corresponding inputs of the predictions for student to mimic which have different formulations in CNN detector and DETR and reliable distillation requires sufficient distillation points which are consistent between teacher and student. Based on this observation we propose the first general knowledge distillation paradigm for DETR(KD-DETR) with consistent distillation points sampling for both homogeneous and heterogeneous distillation. Specifically we decouple detection and distillation tasks by introducing a set of specialized object queries to construct distillation points for DETR. We further propose a general-to-specific distillation points sampling strategy to explore the extensibility of KD-DETR. Extensive experiments validate the effectiveness and generalization of KD-DETR. For both single-scale DAB-DETR and multis-scale Deformable DETR and DINO KD-DETR boost the performance of student model with improvements of 2.6%-5.2%. We further extend KD-DETR to heterogeneous distillation and achieves 2.1% improvement by distilling the knowledge from DINO to Faster R-CNN with ResNet-50 which is comparable with homogeneous distillation methods."},
{"title": "Absolute Pose from One or Two Scaled and Oriented Features", "authors": "Jonathan Ventura, Zuzana Kukelova, Torsten Sattler, Dániel Baráth", "abstract": "Keypoints used for image matching often include an estimate of the feature scale and orientation. While recent work has demonstrated the advantages of using feature scales and orientations for relative pose estimation relatively little work has considered their use for absolute pose estimation. We introduce minimal solutions for absolute pose from two oriented feature correspondences in the general case or one scaled and oriented correspondence given a known vertical direction. Nowadays assuming a known direction is not particularly restrictive as modern consumer devices such as smartphones or drones are equipped with Inertial Measurement Units (IMU) that provide the gravity direction by default. Compared to traditional absolute pose methods requiring three point correspondences our solvers need a smaller minimal sample reducing the cost and complexity of robust estimation. Evaluations on large-scale and public real datasets demonstrate the advantage of our methods for fast and accurate localization in challenging conditions.

However the deployment of these large-scale MLLMs on client devices is hindered by their extensive model parameters leading to a notable decline in generalization capabilities when these models are compressed for device deployment. Addressing this challenge we introduce a Cloud-Device Collaborative Continual Adaptation framework designed to enhance the performance of compressed device-deployed MLLMs by leveraging the robust capabilities of cloud-based larger-scale MLLMs. Our framework is structured into three key components: a device-to-cloud uplink for efficient data transmission cloud-based knowledge adaptation and an optimized cloud-to-device downlink for model deployment. In the uplink phase we employ an Uncertainty-guided Token Sampling (UTS) strategy to effectively filter out-of-distribution tokens thereby reducing transmission costs and improving training efficiency. On the cloud side we propose Adapter-based Knowledge Distillation (AKD) method to transfer refined knowledge from large-scale to compressed pocket-size MLLMs. Furthermore we propose a Dynamic Weight update Compression (DWC) strategy for the downlink which adaptively selects and quantizes updated weight parameters enhancing transmission efficiency and reducing the representational disparity between cloud and device models. Extensive experiments on several multimodal benchmarks demonstrate the superiority of our proposed framework over prior Knowledge Distillation and device-cloud collaboration methods. Notably we also validate the feasibility of our approach to real-world experiments."},

Often parts of a captured 3D scene or object are missing due to mesh reconstruction failures or a lack of observations (e.g. contact regions such as the bottom of objects or hard-to-reach areas). We approach this challenging 3D inpainting problem by leveraging a 2D inpainting diffusion model. We identify a surprising behavior of these models where they generate more 3D consistent inpaints when images form a 2x2 grid and show how to generalize this behavior to more than four images. We then present an iterative framework to distill these inpainted regions into a single consistent 3D scene. In contrast to related works we focus on completing scenes rather than deleting foreground objects and our approach does not require tight 2D object masks or text.

{"title": "Scaled Decoupled Distillation", "authors": "Shicai Wei, Chunbo Luo, Yang Luo", "abstract": "Logit knowledge distillation attracts increasing attention due to its practicality in recent studies. However it often suffers inferior performance compared to the feature knowledge distillation. In this paper we argue that existing logit-based methods may be sub-optimal since they only leverage the global logit output that couples multiple semantic knowledge. This may transfer ambiguous knowledge to the student and mislead its learning. To this end we propose a simple but effective method i.e. Scale Decoupled Distillation (SDD) for logit knowledge distillation. SDD decouples the global logit output into multiple local logit outputs and establishes distillation pipelines for them. This helps the student to mine and inherit fine-grained and unambiguous logit knowledge. Moreover the decoupled knowledge can be further divided into consistent and complementary logit knowledge that transfers the semantic information and sample ambiguity respectively. By increasing the weight of complementary parts SDD can guide the student to focus more on ambiguous samples improving its discrimination ability. Extensive experiments on several benchmark datasets demonstrate the effectiveness of SDD for wide teacher-student pairs especially in the fine-grained classification task.

A key enabler for generating high-resolution images with low computational cost has been the development of latent diffusion models (LDMs). In contrast to conventional diffusion models LDMs perform the denoising process in the low-dimensional latent space of a pre-trained autoencoder (AE) instead of the high-dimensional image space. Despite their relevance the forensic analysis of LDMs is still in its infancy. In this work we propose AEROBLADE a novel detection method which exploits an inherent component of LDMs: the AE used to transform images between image and latent space. We find that generated images can be more accurately reconstructed by the AE than real images allowing for a simple detection approach based on the reconstruction error. Most importantly our method is easy to implement and does not require any training yet nearly matches the performance of detectors that rely on extensive training. We empirically demonstrate that AEROBLADE is effective against state-of-the-art LDMs including Stable Diffusion and Midjourney. Beyond detection our approach allows for the qualitative analysis of images which can be leveraged for identifying inpainted regions.

However in almost all cases the images have been used as provided with little exploration of pre-processing steps beyond normalization and data augmentation. Virtually all images posted on the web or captured by devices are processed for viewing by humans. Is the pipeline used for humans also best for use by computers and deep networks? The human visual system uses logarithmic sensors; differences and sums correspond to ratios and products. Features in log space will be invariant to intensity changes and robust to color balance changes. Log RGB space also reveals structure that is corrupted by typical pre-processing. We explore using linear and log RGB data for training standard backbone architectures on an image classification task using data derived directly from RAW images to guarantee its integrity. We found that networks trained on log RGB data exhibit improved performance on an unmodified test set and invariance to intensity and color balance modifications without additional training or data augmentation. Furthermore we found that the gains from using high quality log data could also be partially or fully realized from data in 8-bit sRGB-JPG format by inverting the sRGB transform and taking the log. These results imply existing databases may benefit from this type of pre-processing. While working with log data we found it was critical to retain the integrity of the log relationships and that networks using log data train best with meta-parameters different than those used for sRGB or linear data. Finally we introduce a new 10-category 10k RAW image data set (RAW10) for image classification and other purposes to enable further the exploration of log RGB as an input format for deep networks in computer vision."},

In this paper we discover that the image residual errors i.e. blur-sharp pixel differences can be grouped into some categories according to their motion blur type and how complex their neighboring pixels are. Inspired by this we decompose the deblurring (regression) task into blur pixel discretization (pixel-level blur classification) and discrete-to-continuous conversion (regression with blur class map) tasks. Specifically we generate the discretized image residual errors by identifying the blur pixels and then transform them to a continuous form which is computationally more efficient than naively solving the original regression problem with continuous values. Here we found that the discretization result i.e. blur segmentation map remarkably exhibits visual similarity with the image residual errors. As a result our efficient model shows comparable performance to state-of-the-art methods in realistic benchmarks while our method is up to 10 times computationally more efficient."},

However most existing deterministic edge detection methods produce only a single edge map for one input image. We argue that generating multiple edge maps is more reasonable than generating a single one considering the subjectivity and ambiguity of the edges. Thus motivated in this paper we propose multiple granularity edge detection called MuGE which can produce a wide range of edge maps from approximate object contours to fine texture edges. Specifically we first propose to design an edge granularity network to estimate the edge granularity from an individual edge annotation. Subsequently to guide the generation of diversified edge maps we integrate such edge granularity into the multi-scale feature maps in the spatial domain. Meanwhile we decompose the feature maps into low-frequency and high-frequency parts where the encoded edge granularity is further fused into the high-frequency part to achieve more precise control over the details of the produced edge maps. Compared to previous methods MuGE is able to not only generate multiple edge maps at different controllable granularities but also achieve a competitive performance on the BSDS500 and Multicue benchmark datasets."},

FSCIL methods inherently face the challenge of catastrophic forgetting as data arrives incrementally making models susceptible to overwriting previously acquired knowledge. Moreover given the scarcity of labeled samples available at any given time models may be prone to overfitting and find it challenging to strike a balance between extensive pretraining and the limited incremental data. To address these challenges we propose the OrCo framework built on two core principles: features' orthogonality in the representation space and contrastive learning. In particular we improve the generalization of the embedding space by employing a combination of supervised and self-supervised contrastive losses during the pretraining phase. Additionally we introduce OrCo loss to address challenges arising from data limitations during incremental sessions. Through feature space perturbations and orthogonality between classes the OrCo loss maximizes margins and reserves space for the following incremental data. This in turn ensures the accommodation of incoming classes in the feature space without compromising previously acquired knowledge.

We present GenFlow an approach that enables both accuracy and generalization to novel objects with the guidance of the target object's shape. Our method predicts optical flow between the rendered image and the observed image and refines the 6D pose iteratively. It boosts the performance by a constraint of the 3D shape and the generalizable geometric knowledge learned from an end-to-end differentiable system. We further improve our model by designing a cascade network architecture to exploit the multi-scale correlations and coarse-to-fine refinement. GenFlow ranked first on the unseen object pose estimation benchmarks in both the RGB and RGB-D cases.

To this end we find an inductive bias that the time-steps of a Diffusion Model (DM) can isolate the nuanced class attributes i.e. as the forward diffusion adds noise to an image at each time-step nuanced attributes are usually lost at an earlier time-step than the spurious attributes that are visually prominent. Building on this we propose Time-step Few-shot (TiF) learner. We train class-specific low-rank adapters for a text-conditioned DM to make up for the lost attributes such that images can be accurately reconstructed from their noisy ones given a prompt. Hence at a small time-step the adapter and prompt are essentially a parameterization of only the nuanced class attributes. For a test image we can use the parameterization to only extract the nuanced class attributes for classification. TiF learner significantly outperforms OpenCLIP and its adapters on a variety of fine-grained and customized few-shot learning tasks. Codes are in https://github.com/yue-zhongqi/tif."},

In this work we propose  \\bf AnyRef   a general MLLM model that can generate pixel-wise object perceptions and natural language descriptions from multi-modality references such as texts boxes images or audio. This innovation empowers users with greater flexibility to engage with the model beyond textual and regional prompts without modality-specific designs. Through our proposed refocusing mechanism the generated grounding output is guided to better focus on the referenced object implicitly incorporating additional pixel-level supervision. This simple modification utilizes attention scores generated during the inference of LLM eliminating the need for extra computations while exhibiting performance enhancements in both grounding masks and referring expressions.

In view of extremely slow convergence in typical DiT recent breakthroughs have been driven by mask strategy that significantly improves the training efficiency of DiT with additional intra-image contextual learning. Despite this progress mask strategy still suffers from two inherent limitations: (a) training-inference discrepancy and (b) fuzzy relations between mask reconstruction & generative diffusion process resulting in sub-optimal training of DiT. In this work we address these limitations by novelly unleashing the self-supervised discrimination knowledge to boost DiT training. Technically we frame our DiT in a teacher-student manner. The teacher-student discriminative pairs are built on the diffusion noises along the same Probability Flow Ordinary Differential Equation (PF-ODE). Instead of applying mask reconstruction loss over both DiT encoder and decoder we decouple DiT encoder and decoder to separately tackle discriminative and generative objectives. In particular by encoding discriminative pairs with student and teacher DiT encoders a new discriminative loss is designed to encourage the inter-image alignment in the self-supervised embedding space. After that student samples are fed into student DiT decoder to perform the typical generative diffusion task. Extensive experiments are conducted on ImageNet dataset and our method achieves a competitive balance between training cost and generative capacity."},

However existing methods fully relying on implicit representations are so resource-hungry that they cannot run on portable devices which deviates from the original intention of SLAM. In this paper we present Photo-SLAM a novel SLAM framework with a hyper primitives map. Specifically we simultaneously exploit explicit geometric features for localization and learn implicit photometric features to represent the texture information of the observed environment. In addition to actively densifying hyper primitives based on geometric features we further introduce a Gaussian-Pyramid-based training method to progressively learn multi-level features enhancing photorealistic mapping performance. The extensive experiments with monocular stereo and RGB-D datasets prove that our proposed system Photo-SLAM significantly outperforms current state-of-the-art SLAM systems for online photorealistic mapping e.g. PSNR is 30% higher and rendering speed is hundreds of times faster in the Replica dataset.

However we argue that for domestic species of great importance like the horse it is a highly valuable investment to put effort into gathering a large dataset of real 3D scans and learn a realistic 3D articulated shape model. We introduce VAREN a novel 3D articulated parametric shape model learned from 3D scans of many real horses. VAREN bridges synthesis and analysis tasks as the generated model instances have unprecedented realism while being able to represent horses of different sizes and shapes. Differently from previous body models VAREN has two resolutions an anatomical skeleton and interpretable learned pose-dependent deformations which are related to the body muscles. We show with experiments that this formulation has superior performance with respect to previous strategies for modeling pose-dependent deformations in the human body case while also being more compact and allowing an analysis of the relationship between articulation and muscle deformation during articulated motion."},

Traditional applications of 2D diffusion models in dynamic scene editing often result in inconsistency primarily due to their inherent frame-by-frame editing methodology. Addressing the complexities of extending instruction-guided editing to 4D our key insight is to treat a 4D scene as a pseudo-3D scene decoupled into two sub-problems: achieving temporal consistency in video editing and applying these edits to the pseudo-3D scene. Following this we first enhance the Instruct-Pix2Pix (IP2P) model with an anchor-aware attention module for batch processing and consistent editing. Additionally we integrate optical flow-guided appearance propagation in a sliding window fashion for more precise frame-to-frame editing and incorporate depth-based projection to manage the extensive data of pseudo-3D scenes followed by iterative editing to achieve convergence. We extensively evaluate our approach in various scenes and editing instructions and demonstrate that it achieves spatially and temporally consistent editing results with significantly enhanced detail and sharpness over the prior art. Notably Instruct 4D-to-4D is general and applicable to both monocular and challenging multi-camera scenes."},

Recently diffusion models have shown remarkable results in generation quality of 3D objects. However none of the existing models enable disentangled generation to control the shape and appearance separately. For the first time we present a suitable representation for 3D diffusion models to enable such disentanglement by introducing a hybrid point cloud and neural radiance field approach. We model a diffusion process over point positions jointly with a high-dimensional feature space for a local density and radiance decoder. While the point positions represent the coarse shape of the object the point features allow modeling the geometry and appearance details. This disentanglement enables us to sample both independently and therefore to control both separately. Our approach sets a new state of the art in generation compared to previous disentanglement-capable methods by reduced FID scores of 30-90% and is on-par with other non-disentanglement-capable state-of-the art methods."},

We propose hierarchical Generative Cellular Automata (hGCA) a spatially scalable conditional 3D generative model which grows geometry recursively with local kernels following GCAs in a coarse-to-fine manner equipped with a light-weight planner to induce global consistency. Experiments on synthetic scenes show that hGCA generates plausible scene geometry with higher fidelity and completeness compared to state-of-the-art baselines.

A promising recent approach in this realm is Delta Denoising Score (DDS) - an image editing technique based on Score Distillation Sampling (SDS) framework that leverages the rich generative prior of text-to-image diffusion models. However relying solely on the difference between scoring functions is insufficient for preserving specific structural elements from the original image a crucial aspect of image editing. To address this here we present an embarrassingly simple yet very powerful modification of DDS called Contrastive Denoising Score (CDS) for latent diffusion models (LDM). Inspired by the similarities and differences between DDS and the contrastive learning for unpaired image-to-image translation(CUT) we introduce a straightforward approach using CUT loss within the DDS framework. Rather than employing auxiliary networks as in the original CUT approach we leverage the intermediate features of LDM specifically those from the self-attention layers which possesses rich spatial information. Our approach enables zero-shot image-to-image translation and neural radiance field (NeRF) editing achieving structural correspondence between the input and output while maintaining content controllability. Qualitative results and comparisons demonstrates the effectiveness of our proposed method."},

To this end in this paper we propose SurroundSDF to implicitly predict the signed distance field (SDF) and semantic field for the continuous perception from surround images. Specifically we introduce a query-based approach and utilize SDF constrained by the Eikonal formulation to accurately describe the surfaces of obstacles. Furthermore considering the absence of precise SDF ground truth we propose a novel weakly supervised paradigm for SDF referred to as the Sandwich Eikonal formulation which emphasizes applying correct and dense constraints on both sides of the surface thereby enhancing the perceptual accuracy of the surface. Experiments suggest that our method achieves SOTA for both occupancy prediction and 3D scene reconstruction tasks on the nuScenes dataset."},

First we construct a collision-aware relation graph based on the agents' observed trajectories. Upon this graph structure we build our core module that aggregates the agent features from diverse social distances. As a result the network is able to model complex social relations thereby yielding more accurate and socially acceptable trajectories. Our HighGraph is a plug-and-play module that can be easily applied to any current trajectory predictors.

Vision Transformers extract visual information by representing image regions as transformed tokens and integrating them via attention weights.

To incorporate the influence of token transformation into interpretation we propose TokenTM a novel post-hoc explanation method that utilizes our introduced measurement of token transformation effects. Specifically we quantify token transformation effects by measuring changes in token lengths and correlations in their directions pre- and post-transformation. Moreover we develop initialization and aggregation rules to integrate both attention weights and token transformation effects across all layers capturing holistic token contributions throughout the model. Experimental results on segmentation and perturbation tests demonstrate the superiority of our proposed TokenTM compared to state-of-the-art Vision Transformer explanation methods."},

Despite its superiority in VSR accuracy the heavy computational burden as well as the large memory footprint hinder the deployment of Transformer-based VSR models on constrained devices. In this paper we address the above issue by proposing a novel feature-level masked processing framework: VSR with Masked Intra and inter-frame Attention (MIA-VSR). The core of MIA-VSR is leveraging feature-level temporal continuity between adjacent frames to reduce redundant computations and make more rational use of previously enhanced SR features. Concretely we propose an intra-frame and inter-frame attention block which takes the respective roles of past features and input features into consideration and only exploits previously enhanced features to provide supplementary information. In addition an adaptive block-wise mask prediction module is developed to skip unimportant computations according to feature similarity between adjacent frames. We conduct detailed ablation studies to validate our contributions and compare the proposed method with recent state-of-the-art VSR approaches.

While image generation methods have produced segmentations they cannot generate alpha mattes with accurate details in hair fur and transparencies. This is likely due to the small size of current alpha matting datasets and the difficulty in obtaining ground-truth alpha. We propose a scalable method for synthesizing images of objects with high-quality alpha that can be used as a ground-truth dataset. A key idea is to generate objects on a single-colored background so chroma keying approaches can be used to extract the alpha. However this faces several challenges including that current text-to-image generation methods cannot create images that can be easily chroma keyed and that chroma keying is an underconstrained problem that generally requires manual intervention for high-quality results. We address this using a combination of generation and alpha extraction methods. Using our method we generate a dataset of 150000 objects with alpha.

In practice there is a large domain gap between different hospitals' data such as the variable data quality due to differences in acquisition equipment. In addition accurate annotation information provided by obstetrician experts is always very costly or even unavailable. This study explores the unsupervised domain adaptive fetal cardiac structure detection issue. Existing unsupervised domain adaptive object detection (UDAOD) approaches mainly focus on detecting objects in natural scenes such as Foggy Cityscapes where the structural relationships of natural scenes are uncertain. Unlike all previous UDAOD scenarios we first collected a Fetal Cardiac Structure dataset from two hospital centers called FCS and proposed a multi-matching UDA approach (M3-UDA) including Histogram Matching (HM) Sub-structure Matching (SM) and Global-structure Matching (GM) to better transfer the topological knowledge of anatomical structure for UDA detection in medical scenarios. HM mitigates the domain gap between the source and target caused by pixel transformation. SM fuses the different angle information of the sub-structure to obtain the local topological knowledge for bridging the domain gap of the internal sub-structure. GM is designed to align the global topological knowledge of the whole organ from the source and target domain.

Current IS pipelines fall into two categories: single-granularity output and multi-granularity output. The latter aims to alleviate the spatial ambiguity present in the former. However the multi-granularity output pipeline suffers from limited interaction flexibility and produces redundant results. In this work we introduce Granularity-Controllable Interactive Segmentation (GraCo) a novel approach that allows precise control of prediction granularity by introducing additional parameters to input. This enhances the customization of the interactive system and eliminates redundancy while resolving ambiguity. Nevertheless the exorbitant cost of annotating multi-granularity masks and the lack of available datasets with granularity annotations make it difficult for models to acquire the necessary guidance to control output granularity. To address this problem we design an any-granularity mask generator that exploits the semantic property of the pre-trained IS model to automatically generate abundant mask-granularity pairs without requiring additional manual annotation. Based on these pairs we propose a granularity-controllable learning strategy that efficiently imparts the granularity controllability to the IS model. Extensive experiments on intricate scenarios at object and part levels demonstrate that our GraCo has significant advantages over previous methods.

To achieve this we draw motivations from the perspective of the Bayesian rule and propose a dual-embedding guided framework for backdoor attacks. Specifically we ensure that visual trigger patterns approximate the textual target semantics in the embedding space making it challenging to detect the subtle parameter variations induced by backdoor learning on such natural trigger patterns. Additionally we optimize the visual trigger patterns to align the poisoned samples with target vision features in order to hinder backdoor unlearning through clean fine-tuning.

As conventional GANs attempt to generate images that match the distribution of the target domain they may hallucinate spurious instances of classes absent from the source domain thereby diminishing the usefulness and reliability of translated images.

This is due to two key reasons: (i) independently inpainting constituent images results in view-inconsistent imagery and (ii) 2D inpainters struggle to ensure high-quality geometry completion and alignment with inpainted RGB images. To overcome these limitations we propose a novel approach called MVIP-NeRF that harnesses the potential of diffusion priors for NeRF inpainting addressing both appearance and geometry aspects. MVIP-NeRF performs joint inpainting across multiple views to reach a consistent solution which is achieved via an iterative optimization process based on Score Distillation Sampling (SDS). Apart from recovering the rendered RGB images we also extract normal maps as a geometric representation and define a normal SDS loss that motivates accurate geometry inpainting and alignment with the appearance. Additionally we formulate a multi-view SDS score function to distill generative priors simultaneously from different view images ensuring consistent visual completion when dealing with large view variations. Our experimental results show better appearance and geometry recovery than previous NeRF inpainting methods."},

Efros, Xiaolong Wang", "abstract": "While neural rendering has led to impressive advances in scene reconstruction and novel view synthesis it relies heavily on accurately pre-computed camera poses. To relax this constraint multiple efforts have been made to train Neural Radiance Fields (NeRFs) without pre-processed camera poses. However the implicit representations of NeRFs provide extra challenges to optimize the 3D structure and camera poses at the same time. On the other hand the recently proposed 3D Gaussian Splatting provides new opportunities given its explicit point cloud representations. This paper leverages both the explicit geometric representation and the continuity of the input video stream to perform novel view synthesis without any SfM preprocessing. We process the input frames in a sequential manner and progressively grow the 3D Gaussians set by taking one input frame at a time without the need to pre-compute the camera poses. Our method significantly improves over previous approaches in view synthesis and camera pose estimation under large motion changes.

However the existing methods all follow the iterative framework of a single image prior which limits the efficiency of the unfolding methods and makes it a problem to use other priors simply and effectively. To break out of the box we derive an effective Dual Prior Unfolding (DPU) which achieves the joint utilization of multiple deep priors and greatly improves iteration efficiency. Our unfolding method is implemented through two parts i.e. Dual Prior Framework (DPF) and Focused Attention (FA). In brief in addition to the normal image prior DPF introduces a residual into the iteration formula and constructs a degraded prior for the residual by considering various degradations to establish the unfolding framework. To improve the effectiveness of the image prior based on self-attention FA adopts a novel mechanism inspired by PCA denoising to scale and filter attention which lets the attention focus more on effective features with little computation cost. Besides an asymmetric backbone is proposed to further improve the efficiency of hierarchical self-attention. Remarkably our 5-stage DPU achieves state-of-the-art (SOTA) performance with the least FLOPs and parameters compared to previous methods while our 9-stage DPU significantly outperforms other unfolding methods with less computational requirement."},

In person re-ID Jaccard distance is a widely used distance metric especially in re-ranking and clustering scenarios. However we discover that camera variation has a significant negative impact on the reliability of Jaccard distance. In particular Jaccard distance calculates the distance based on the overlap of relevant neighbors. Due to camera variation intra-camera samples dominate the relevant neighbors which reduces the reliability of the neighbors by introducing intra-camera negative samples and excluding inter-camera positive samples. To overcome this problem we propose a novel camera-aware Jaccard (CA-Jaccard) distance that leverages camera information to enhance the reliability of Jaccard distance. Specifically we design camera-aware k-reciprocal nearest neighbors (CKRNNs) to find k-reciprocal nearest neighbors on the intra-camera and inter-camera ranking lists which improves the reliability of relevant neighbors and guarantees the contribution of inter-camera samples in the overlap. Moreover we propose a camera-aware local query expansion (CLQE) to mine reliable samples in relevant neighbors by exploiting camera variation as a strong constraint and assign these samples higher weights in overlap further improving the reliability. Our CA-Jaccard distance is simple yet effective and can serve as a general distance metric for person re-ID methods with high reliability and low computational cost.

In this paper we instead study the naturally supervised setting that learns from only 3D scene and QA pairs where prior works underperform. We propose the Language-Regularized Concept Learner (LARC) which uses constraints from language as regularization to significantly improve the accuracy of neuro-symbolic concept learners in the naturally supervised setting. Our approach is based on two core insights: the first is that language constraints (e.g. a word's relation to another) can serve as effective regularization for structured representations in neuro-symbolic models; the second is that we can query large language models to distill such constraints from language properties. We show that LARC improves performance of prior works in naturally supervised 3D visual grounding and demonstrates a wide range of 3D visual reasoning capabilities--from zero-shot composition to data efficiency and transferability. Our method represents a promising step towards regularizing structured visual reasoning frameworks with language-based priors for learning in settings without dense supervision."},

Inspired by this we seek to unify the output space of video understanding tasks by using languages as labels and additionally introducing time and box tokens. In this way a variety of video tasks could be formulated as video-grounded token generation. This enables us to address various types of video tasks including classification (such as action recognition) captioning (covering clip captioning video question answering and dense video captioning) and localization tasks (such as visual object tracking) within a fully shared encoder-decoder architecture following a generative framework.

To tackle the issues we first dig out the intricate relationships among facial factors and simplify the decoupling process tailoring a Progressive Audio Disentanglement for accurate facial geometry and semantics learning where each stage incorporates a customized training module responsible for a specific factor. Secondly to achieve visually diverse and audio-synchronized animation solely from input audio within a single model we introduce the Controllable Coherent Frame generation which involves the flexible integration of three trainable adapters with frozen Latent Diffusion Models (LDMs) to focus on maintaining facial geometry and semantics as well as texture and temporal coherence between frames.

We would like to highlight that the data samples of the target modality are irrelevant to the other modalities which distinguishes our method from other works utilizing paired (e.g. CLIP) or interleaved data of different modalities. We propose a methodology named Multimodal Pathway - given a target modality and a transformer designed for it we use an auxiliary transformer trained with data of another modality and construct pathways to connect components of the two models so that data of the target modality can be processed by both models. In this way we utilize the universal sequence-to-sequence modeling abilities of transformers obtained from two modalities. As a concrete implementation we use a modality-specific tokenizer and task-specific head as usual but utilize the transformer blocks of the auxiliary model via a proposed method named Cross-Modal Re-parameterization which exploits the auxiliary weights without any inference costs.

Depending on how visually sim- ilar a test example is to the training categories the OSR task can be easy or extremely challenging. However the vast majority of previous work has studied OSR in the presence of large coarse-grained semantic shifts. In contrast many real-world problems are inherently fine- grained which means that test examples may be highly visually similar to the training categories. Motivated by this observation we investigate three aspects of OSR: label granularity similarity between the open- and closed-sets and the role of hierarchical supervision during training. To study these dimensions we curate new open-set splits of a large fine-grained visual categorization dataset. Our anal- ysis results in several interesting findings including: (i) the best OSR method to use is heavily dependent on the degree of semantic shift present and (ii) hierarchical rep- resentation learning can improve coarse-grained OSR but has little effect on fine-grained OSR performance. To fur- ther enhance fine-grained OSR performance we propose a hierarchy-adversarial learning method to discourage hier- archical structure in the representation space which results in a perhaps counter-intuitive behaviour and a relative im- provement in fine-grained OSR of up to 2% in AUROC and 7% in AUPR over standard training.

To alleviate these issues we draw inspiration from the recent Retentive Network (RetNet) in the field of NLP and propose RMT a strong vision backbone with explicit spatial prior for general purposes. Specifically we extend the RetNet's temporal decay mechanism to the spatial domain and propose a spatial decay matrix based on the Manhattan distance to introduce the explicit spatial prior to Self-Attention. Additionally an attention decomposition form that adeptly adapts to explicit spatial prior is proposed aiming to reduce the computational burden of modeling global information without disrupting the spatial decay matrix. Based on the spatial decay matrix and the attention decomposition form we can flexibly integrate explicit spatial prior into the vision backbone with linear complexity. Extensive experiments demonstrate that RMT exhibits exceptional performance across various vision tasks.

In this paper we introduce the Poly Kernel Inception Network (PKINet) to handle the above challenges. PKINet employs multi-scale convolution kernels without dilation to extract object features of varying scales and capture local context.

Existing solutions to ODG face limitations due to constrained generalizations of traditional CNN backbones and errors in detecting target open samples in the absence of prior knowledge. Addressing these pitfalls we introduce ODG-CLIP harnessing the semantic prowess of the vision-language model CLIP. Our framework brings forth three primary innovations: Firstly distinct from prevailing paradigms we conceptualize ODG as a multi-class classification challenge encompassing both known and novel categories. Central to our approach is modeling a unique prompt tailored for detecting unknown class samples and to train this we employ a readily accessible stable diffusion model elegantly generating proxy images for the open class. Secondly aiming for domain-tailored classification (prompt) weights while ensuring a balance of precision and simplicity we devise a novel visual style-centric prompt learning mechanism. Finally we infuse images with class-discriminative knowledge derived from the prompt space to augment the fidelity of CLIP's visual embeddings. We introduce a novel objective to safeguard the continuity of this infused semantic intel across domains especially for the shared classes.

Therefore to reduce potential drift in the feature extractor existing exemplar-free methods are typically evaluated in settings where the first task is significantly larger than subsequent tasks. Their performance drops drastically in more challenging settings starting with a smaller first task. To address this problem of feature drift estimation for exemplar-free methods we propose to adversarially perturb the current samples such that their embeddings are close to the old class prototypes in the old model embedding space. We then estimate the drift in the embedding space from the old to the new model using the perturbed images and compensate the prototypes accordingly. We exploit the fact that adversarial samples are transferable from the old to the new feature space in a continual learning setting. The generation of these images is simple and computationally cheap. We demonstrate in our experiments that the proposed approach better tracks the movement of prototypes in embedding space and outperforms existing methods on several standard continual learning benchmarks as well as on fine-grained datasets.

(2) The results reconstructed by these methods are often misaligned with the real high-resolution images leading to remarkable distortion in the reconstructed MR images. To address the aforementioned issues we propose an efficient diffusion model for multi-contrast MRI SR named as DiffMSR. Specifically we apply DM in a highly compact low-dimensional latent space to generate prior knowledge with high-frequency detail information. The highly compact latent space ensures that DM requires only a few simple iterations to produce accurate prior knowledge. In addition we design the Prior-Guide Large Window Transformer (PLWformer) as the decoder for DM which can extend the receptive field while fully utilizing the prior knowledge generated by DM to ensure that the reconstructed MR image remains undistorted. Extensive experiments on public and clinical datasets demonstrate that our DiffMSR outperforms state-of-the-art methods."},

We rethink the learning objective for mDG and design a new general learning objective to interpret and analyze most existing mDG wisdom. This general objective is bifurcated into two synergistic amis: learning domain-independent conditional features and maximizing a posterior. Explorations also extend to two effective regularization terms that incorporate prior information and suppress invalid causality alleviating the issues that come with relaxed constraints. We theoretically contribute an upper bound for the domain alignment of domain-independent conditional features disclosing that many previous mDG endeavors actually optimize partially the objective and thus lead to limited performance. As such our study distills a general learning objective into four practical components providing a general robust and flexible mechanism to handle complex domain shifts.

A crucial property of novelty detection methods is universality which can be interpreted as generalization across various distributions of training or test data. More precisely for novelty detection distribution shifts may occur in the training set or the test set. Shifts in the training set refer to cases where we train a novelty detector on a new dataset and expect strong transferability. Conversely distribution shifts in the test set indicate the methods' performance when the trained model encounters a shifted test sample. We experimentally show that existing methods falter in maintaining universality which stems from their rigid inductive biases. Motivated by this we aim for more generalized techniques that have more adaptable inductive biases. In this context we leverage the fact that contrastive learning provides an efficient framework to easily switch and adapt to new inductive biases through the proper choice of augmentations in forming the negative pairs. We propose a novel probabilistic auto-negative pair generation method AutoAugOOD along with contrastive learning to yield a universal novelty detector method.

First our CLIP Image Adapter mitigates the domain gap between 3D-rendered images and natural images by adapting the visual representations of CLIP for synthetic image-text pairs. Subsequently our Dual Adapters decouple the 3D shape representation space into two complementary sub-spaces: one focusing on visual attributes and the other for semantic understanding which ensure a more comprehensive and effective multi-modal pre-training. Extensive experiments demonstrate that TAMM consistently enhances 3D representations for a wide range of 3D encoder architectures pre-training datasets and downstream tasks. Notably we boost the zero-shot classification accuracy on Objaverse-LVIS from 46.8% to 50.7% and improve the 5-way 10-shot linear probing classification accuracy on ModelNet40 from 96.1% to 99.0%.

However this approach faces challenges in modeling scene dynamics in urban environments where moving objects of various categories and scales are present. In such settings it becomes crucial to effectively eliminate moving objects to accurately reconstruct static backgrounds. Our research introduces an innovative method termed here as Entity-NeRF which combines the strengths of knowledge-based and statistical strategies. This approach utilizes entity-wise statistics leveraging entity segmentation and stationary entity classification through thing/stuff segmentation.

It is also unclear how to efficiently scale the model for better performance at reduced cost. The different training settings and expensive training cost make a fair model comparison extremely difficult. In this work we empirically study the scaling properties of diffusion based T2I models by performing extensive and rigours ablations on scaling both denoising backbones and training set including training scaled UNet and Transformer variants ranging from 0.4B to 4B parameters on datasets upto 600M images. For model scaling we find the location and amount of cross attention distinguishes the performance of existing UNet designs. And increasing the transformer blocks is more parameter-efficient for improving text-image alignment than increasing channel numbers. We then identify an efficient UNet variant which is 45% smaller and 28% faster than SDXL's UNet. On the data scaling side we show the quality and diversity of the training set matters more than simply dataset size. Increasing caption density and diversity improves text-image alignment performance and the learning efficiency. Finally we provide scaling functions to predict the text-image alignment performance as functions of the scale of model size compute and dataset size."},

Particularly distribution matching-based distillation methods attract attention thanks to its effectiveness and low computational cost. However these methods face two primary limitations: the dispersed feature distribution within the same class in synthetic datasets reducing class discrimination and an exclusive focus on mean feature consistency lacking precision and comprehensiveness. To address these challenges we introduce two novel constraints: a class centralization constraint and a covariance matching constraint. The class centralization constraint aims to enhance class discrimination by more closely clustering samples within classes. The covariance matching constraint seeks to achieve more accurate feature distribution matching between real and synthetic datasets through local feature covariance matrices particularly beneficial when sample sizes are much smaller than the number of features. Experiments demonstrate notable improvements with these constraints yielding performance boosts of up to 6.6% on CIFAR10 2.9% on SVHN 2.5% on CIFAR100 and 2.5% on TinyImageNet compared to the state-of-the-art relevant methods.

{"title": "Quantifying Task Priority for Multi-Task Optimization", "authors": "Wooseong Jeong, Kuk-Jin Yoon", "abstract": "The goal of multi-task learning is to learn diverse tasks within a single unified network. As each task has its own unique objective function conflicts emerge during training resulting in negative transfer among them. Earlier research identified these conflicting gradients in shared parameters between tasks and attempted to realign them in the same direction. However we prove that such optimization strategies lead to sub-optimal Pareto solutions due to their inability to accurately determine the individual contributions of each parameter across various tasks. In this paper we propose the concept of task priority to evaluate parameter contributions across different tasks. To learn task priority we identify the type of connections related to links between parameters influenced by task-specific losses during backpropagation. The strength of connections is gauged by the magnitude of parameters to determine task priority. Based on these we present a new method named connection strength-based optimization for multi-task learning which consists of two phases. The first phase learns the task priority within the network while the second phase modifies the gradients while upholding this priority. This ultimately leads to finding new Pareto optimal solutions for multiple tasks. Through extensive experiments we show that our approach greatly enhances multi-task performance in comparison to earlier gradient manipulation methods."},

This work introduces HarmonyView a simple yet effective diffusion sampling technique adept at decomposing two intricate aspects in single-image 3D generation: consistency and diversity. This approach paves the way for a more nuanced exploration of the two critical dimensions within the sampling process.

{"title": "Learned Trajectory Embedding for Subspace Clustering", "authors": "Yaroslava Lochman, Carl Olsson, Christopher Zach", "abstract": "Clustering multiple motions from observed point trajectories is a fundamental task in understanding dynamic scenes. Most motion models require multiple tracks to estimate their parameters hence identifying clusters when multiple motions are observed is a very challenging task. This is even aggravated for high-dimensional motion models. The starting point of our work is that this high-dimensionality of motion model can actually be leveraged to our advantage as sufficiently long trajectories identify the underlying motion uniquely in practice. Consequently we propose to learn a mapping from trajectories to embedding vectors that represent the generating motion. The obtained trajectory embeddings are useful for clustering multiple observed motions but are also trained to contain sufficient information to recover the parameters of the underlying motion by utilizing a geometric loss. We therefore are able to use only weak supervision from given motion segmentation to train this mapping. The entire algorithm consisting of trajectory embedding clustering and motion parameter estimation is highly efficient. We conduct experiments on the Hopkins155 Hopkins12 and KT3DMoSeg datasets and show state-of-the-art performance of our proposed method for trajectory-based motion segmentation on full sequences and its competitiveness on the occluded sequences.

To overcome this challenge we propose DocRes a generalist model that unifies five document image restoration tasks including dewarping deshadowing appearance enhancement deblurring and binarization. To instruct DocRes to perform various restoration tasks we propose a novel visual prompt approach called Dynamic Task-Specific Prompt (DTSPrompt). The DTSPrompt for different tasks comprises distinct prior features which are additional characteristics extracted from the input image. Beyond its role as a cue for task-specific execution DTSPrompt can also serve as supplementary information to enhance the model's performance. Moreover DTSPrompt is more flexible than prior visual prompt approaches as it can be seamlessly applied and adapted to inputs with high and variable resolutions. Experimental results demonstrate that DocRes achieves competitive or superior performance compared to existing state-of-the-art task-specific models.

We generalize event cameras in terms of when an event is generated and what information is transmitted. To implement our designs we turn to single-photon sensors that provide digital access to individual photon detections; this modality gives us the flexibility to realize a rich space of generalized event cameras. Our single-photon event cameras are capable of high-speed high-fidelity imaging at low readout rates. Consequently these event cameras can support plug-and-play downstream inference without capturing new event datasets or designing specialized event-vision models. As a practical implication our designs which involve lightweight and near-sensor-compatible computations provide a way to use single-photon sensors without exorbitant bandwidth costs."},

One effective solution involves watermarking the generated images. However existing methods often compromise the model performance or require additional training which is undesirable for operators and users. To address this issue we propose Gaussian Shading a diffusion model watermarking technique that is both performance-lossless and training-free while serving the dual purpose of copyright protection and tracing of offending content. Our watermark embedding is free of model parameter modifications and thus is plug-and-play. We map the watermark to latent representations following a standard Gaussian distribution which is indistinguishable from latent representations obtained from the non-watermarked diffusion model. Therefore we can achieve watermark embedding with lossless performance for which we also provide theoretical proof. Furthermore since the watermark is intricately linked with image semantics it exhibits resilience to lossy processing and erasure attempts. The watermark can be extracted by Denoising Diffusion Implicit Models (DDIM) inversion and inverse sampling. We evaluate Gaussian Shading on multiple versions of Stable Diffusion and the results demonstrate that Gaussian Shading not only is performance-lossless but also outperforms existing methods in terms of robustness."},

Manually annotating textual descriptions is time-consuming restricting the scale of existing datasets and therefore the generalization ability of ReID models. As a result we study the transferable text-to-image ReID problem where we train a model on our proposed large-scale database and directly deploy it to various datasets for evaluation. We obtain substantial training data via Multi-modal Large Language Models (MLLMs). Moreover we identify and address two key challenges in utilizing the obtained textual descriptions. First an MLLM tends to generate descriptions with similar structures causing the model to overfit specific sentence patterns. Thus we propose a novel method that uses MLLMs to caption images according to various templates. These templates are obtained using a multi-turn dialogue with a Large Language Model (LLM). Therefore we can build a large-scale dataset with diverse textual descriptions. Second an MLLM may produce incorrect descriptions. Hence we introduce a novel method that automatically identifies words in a description that do not correspond with the image. This method is based on the similarity between one text and all patch token embeddings in the image. Then we mask these words with a larger probability in the subsequent training epoch alleviating the impact of noisy textual descriptions. The experimental results demonstrate that our methods significantly boost the direct transfer text-to-image ReID performance. Benefiting from the pre-trained model weights we also achieve state-of-the-art performance in the traditional evaluation settings."},

These studies boost the zero-shot accuracy of pretrained VL models with an ensemble of label-specific text generated by GPT. A recent study WaffleCLIP demonstrated that similar zero-shot accuracy can be achieved with an ensemble of random descriptors. However both zero-shot methods are un-trainable and consequently sub-optimal when some few-shot out-of-distribution (OOD) training data is available. Inspired by these prior works we present two more flexible methods called descriptor and word soups which do not require an LLM at test time and can leverage training data to increase OOD target accuracy. Descriptor soup greedily selects a small set of textual descriptors using generic few-shot training data then calculates robust class embeddings using the selected descriptors. Word soup greedily assembles a chain of words in a similar manner. Compared to existing few-shot soft prompt tuning methods word soup requires fewer parameters by construction and less GPU memory since it does not require backpropagation. Both soups outperform current published few-shot methods even when combined with SoTA zero-shot methods on cross-dataset and domain generalization benchmarks. Compared with SoTA prompt and descriptor ensembling methods such as ProDA and WaffleCLIP word soup achieves higher OOD accuracy with fewer ensemble members.

Previous detector-free matcher LoFTR has shown remarkable matching capability in handling large-viewpoint change and texture-poor scenarios but suffers from low efficiency.

One key observation is that performing the transformer over the entire feature map is redundant due to shared local information therefore we propose an aggregated attention mechanism with adaptive token selection for efficiency. Furthermore we find spatial variance exists in LoFTR's fine correlation module which is adverse to matching accuracy. A novel two-stage correlation layer is proposed to achieve accurate subpixel correspondences for accuracy improvement. Our efficiency optimized model is ~ 2.5xfaster than LoFTR which can even surpass state-of-the-art efficient sparse matching pipeline SuperPoint + LightGlue.

The inherent intent ambiguity makes it challenging to recognize in multimodal scenarios. Existing MIR methods tend to model the individual video independently ignoring global contextual information across videos. This learning manner inevitably introduces perception biases exacerbated by the inconsistencies of the multimodal representation amplifying the intent uncertainty. This challenge motivates us to explore effective global context modeling. Thus we propose a context-augmented global contrast (CAGC) method to capture rich global context features by mining both intra-and cross-video context interactions for MIR. Concretely we design a context-augmented transformer module to extract global context dependencies across videos. To further alleviate error accumulation and interference we develop a cross-video bank that retrieves effective video sources by considering both intentional tendency and video similarity. Furthermore we introduce a global context-guided contrastive learning scheme designed to mitigate inconsistencies arising from global context and individual modalities in different feature spaces. This scheme incorporates global cues as the supervision to capture robust the multimodal intent representation. Experiments demonstrate CAGC obtains superior performance than state-of-the-art MIR methods.

In addition we show that a naive integration of SCL into federated learning incurs representation collapse resulting in slow convergence and limited performance gains. To address this issue we introduce a relaxed contrastive learning loss that imposes a divergence penalty on excessively similar sample pairs within each class. This strategy prevents collapsed representations and enhances feature transferability facilitating collaborative training and leading to significant performance improvements. Our framework outperforms all existing federated learning approaches by significant margins on the standard benchmarks as demonstrated by extensive experimental results.

In this work we approach the problem by employing a multi-view 2.5D diffusion fine-tuned from a pre-trained 2D diffusion model. The multi-view 2.5D diffusion directly models the structural distribution of 3D data while still maintaining the strong generalization ability of the original 2D diffusion model filling the gap between 2D diffusion-based and direct 3D diffusion-based methods for 3D content generation. During inference multi-view normal maps are generated using the 2.5D diffusion and a novel differentiable rasterization scheme is introduced to fuse the almost consistent multi-view normal maps into a consistent 3D model. We further design a normal-conditioned multi-view image generation module for fast appearance generation given the 3D geometry. Our method is a one-pass diffusion process and does not require any SDS optimization as post-processing.

The panel is obtained through arranging the visual concepts parsed from the input text by the aid of large language models and then injected into the denoising network as a detailed control signal to complement the text condition. To facilitate text-to-panel learning we come up with a carefully designed semantic formatting protocol accompanied by a fully-automatic data preparation pipeline. Thanks to such a design our approach which we call Ranni manages to enhance a pre-trained T2I generator regarding its textual controllability. More importantly the introduction of the generative middleware brings a more convenient form of interaction (i.e. directly adjusting the elements in the panel or using language instructions) and further allows users to finely customize their generation based on which we develop a practical system and showcase its potential in continuous generation and chatting-based editing."},

The current state-of-the-art estimates the total counts as the sum over the object location density map but do not provide object locations and sizes which are crucial for many applications. This is addressed by detection-based counters which however fall behind in the total count accuracy. Furthermore both approaches tend to overestimate the counts in the presence of other object classes due to many false positives. We propose DAVE a low-shot counter based on a detect-and-verify paradigm that avoids the aforementioned issues by first generating a high-recall detection set and then verifying the detections to identify and remove the outliers.This jointly increases the recall and precision leading to accurate counts. DAVE outperforms the top density-based counters by ?20% in the total count MAE it outperforms the most recent detection-based counter by ?20% in detection quality and sets a new state-of-the-art in zero-shot as well as text-prompt-based counting."},

However it is impractical to procure the painstaking patch-level annotation effort required in specialized domains like histopathology and satellite imagery; it is often performed by domain experts and involves hundreds of millions of patches. Modern-day self-supervised learning (SSL) representations encode rich semantic and visual information. In this paper we posit that such representations are expressive enough to act as proxies to fine-grained human labels. We introduce a novel approach that trains diffusion models conditioned on embeddings from SSL. Our diffusion models successfully project these features back to high-quality histopathology and remote sensing images. In addition we construct larger images by assembling spatially consistent patches inferred from SSL embeddings preserving long-range dependencies. Augmenting real data by generating variations of real images improves downstream classifier accuracy for patch-level and larger image-scale classification tasks. Our models are effective even on datasets not encountered during training demonstrating their robustness and generalizability. Generating images from learned embeddings is agnostic to the source of the embeddings. The SSL embeddings used to generate a large image can either be extracted from a reference image or sampled from an auxiliary model conditioned on any related modality (e.g. class labels text genomic data). As proof of concept we introduce the text-to-large image synthesis paradigm where we successfully synthesize large pathology and satellite images out of text descriptions."},

Yet mitigating the degradation of standard generalization performance in adversarial-trained models remains an open problem. This paper attempts to resolve this issue through the lens of model complexity. First We leverage the Fisher-Rao norm a geometrically invariant metric for model complexity to establish the non-trivial bounds of the Cross-Entropy Loss-based Rademacher complexity for a ReLU-activated Multi-Layer Perceptron. Building upon this observation we propose a novel regularization framework called Logit-Oriented Adversarial Training (LOAT) which can mitigate the trade-off between robustness and accuracy while imposing only a negligible increase in computational overhead. Our extensive experiments demonstrate that the proposed regularization strategy can boost the performance of the prevalent adversarial training algorithms including PGD-AT TRADES TRADES (LSE) MART and DM-AT across various network architectures.

However most existing methods either rely only on 2D depth representations or directly incorporate raw 3D point clouds for compensation which are still insufficient to capture the fine-grained 3D geometry of the scene. To address this challenge we introduce Tri-Perspective View Decomposition (TPVD) a novel framework that can explicitly model 3D geometry. In particular (1) TPVD ingeniously decomposes the original point cloud into three 2D views one of which corresponds to the sparse depth input. (2) We design TPV Fusion to update the 2D TPV features through recurrent 2D-3D-2D aggregation where a Distance-Aware Spherical Convolution (DASC) is applied. (3) By adaptively choosing TPV affinitive neighbors the newly proposed Geometric Spatial Propagation Network (GSPN) further improves the geometric consistency. As a result our TPVD outperforms existing methods on KITTI NYUv2 and SUN RGBD. Furthermore we build a novel depth completion dataset named TOFDC which is acquired by the time-of-flight (TOF) sensor and the color camera on smartphones."},

Our key insight is that regions not visible in the training views lead to inherently unreliable color predictions by NeRF at this region resulting in increased uncertainty in the synthesized views. To address this we propose to use Bayesian Networks to composite position-based field uncertainty into ray-based uncertainty in camera observations. Consequently NVF naturally assigns higher uncertainty to unobserved regions aiding robots to select the most informative next viewpoints. Extensive evaluations show that NVF excels not only in uncertainty quantification but also in scene reconstruction for active mapping outperforming existing methods.

Unlike previous works that rely on scarce 3D datasets or limited 2D collections with imbalanced viewing angles and imprecise pose priors our approach aims to develop a zero-shot 3D generative scheme capable of producing visually realistic geometrically accurate and content-wise diverse 3D humans without relying on pre-existing 3D or 2D assets. To address this challenge we introduce a meticulously crafted workflow that implements accurate physical modeling to learn the enhanced 3D generative model from synthetic 2D data. During inference we integrate optimization modules to bridge the gap between realistic appearances and coarse 3D shapes. Specifically En3D comprises three modules: a 3D generator that accurately models generalizable 3D humans with realistic appearance from synthesized balanced diverse and structured human images; a geometry sculptor that enhances shape quality using multi-view normal constraints for intricate human structure; and a texturing module that disentangles explicit texture maps with fidelity and editability leveraging semantical UV partitioning and a differentiable rasterizer.

Motion refinement methods aim to optimize the predicted human pose sequences from pose estimators while ensuring minimal computational overhead and latency. Prior investigations have primarily concentrated on striking a balance between the two objectives i.e. smoothness and precision while optimizing the predicted pose sequences. However it has come to our attention that the tension between these two objectives can provide additional quality cues about the predicted pose sequences. These cues in turn are able to aid the network in optimizing lower-quality poses. To leverage this quality information we propose a motion refinement network termed SynSP to achieve a Synergy of Smoothness and Precision in the sequence refinement tasks. Moreover SynSP can also address multi-view poses of one person simultaneously fixing inaccuracies in predicted poses through heightened attention to similar poses from other views thereby amplifying the resultant quality cues and overall performance. Compared with previous methods SynSP benefits from both pose quality and multi-view information with a much shorter input sequence length achieving state-of-the-art results among four challenging datasets involving 2D 3D and SMPL pose representations in both single-view and multi-view scenes.

Many works have been proposed to address this challenging problem among which uncertainty based self-training is a predominant approach. However without comprehensive denoising mechanisms they still largely fall into biased estimates when dealing with different domains and confirmation bias. In this paper we observe that pseudo-label noise is mainly contained in unstable samples in which the predictions of most pixels undergo significant variations during self-training. Inspired by this we propose a novel mechanism to denoise unstable samples with stable ones. Specifically we introduce the Stable Neighbor Denoising (SND) approach which effectively discovers highly correlated stable and unstable samples by nearest neighbor retrieval and guides the reliable optimization of unstable samples by bi-level learning. Moreover we compensate for the stable set by object-level object paste which can further eliminate the bias caused by less learned classes. Our SND enjoys two advantages. First SND does not require a specific segmentor structure endowing its universality. Second SND simultaneously addresses the issues of class domain and confirmation biases during adaptation ensuring its effectiveness. Extensive experiments show that SND consistently outperforms state-of-the-art methods in various SFUDA semantic segmentation settings. In addition SND can be easily integrated with other approaches obtaining further improvements. The source code will be publicly available."},

Current passport-based methods that obfuscate model functionality for license-to-use and ownership verifications suffer from capacity and quality constraints as they require retraining the owner model for new users. They are also vulnerable to advanced Expanded Residual Block ambiguity attacks. We propose Steganographic Passport which uses an invertible steganographic network to decouple license-to-use from ownership verification by hiding the user's identity images into the owner-side passport and recovering them from their respective user-side passports. An irreversible and collision-resistant hash function is used to avoid exposing the owner-side passport from the derived user-side passports and increase the uniqueness of the model signature. To safeguard both the passport and model's weights against advanced ambiguity attacks an activation-level obfuscation is proposed for the verification branch of the owner's model. By jointly training the verification and deployment branches their weights become tightly coupled. The proposed method supports agile licensing of deep models by providing a strong ownership proof and license accountability without requiring a separate model retraining for the admission of every new user. Experiment results show that our Steganographic Passport outperforms other passport-based deep model protection methods in robustness against various known attacks."},

The contrastive paradigm is currently dominant in this field. However we observe a notable misalignment phenomenon that is the affinity between samples has an obvious disparity across different modalities namely \"Affinity Inconsistency Problem\". Our intuition is that for a well-aligned model two images that look similar to each other should have the same level of similarity as their corresponding texts that describe them. In this paper we first investigate the reason of this inconsistency problem. We discover that the lack of consideration for sample-wise affinity consistency across modalities in existing training objectives is the central cause. To address this problem we propose a novel loss function named Sample-wise affinity Consistency (SaCo) loss which is designed to enhance such consistency by minimizing the distance between image embedding similarity and text embedding similarity for any two samples. Our SaCo loss can be easily incorporated into existing vision-language models as an additional loss due to its complementarity for most training objectives. In addition considering that pre-training from scratch is computationally expensive we also provide a more efficient way to continuously pre-train on a converged model by integrating our loss. Experimentally the model trained with our SaCo loss significantly outperforms the baseline on a variety of vision and language tasks."},

Additionally the color content of the scenes solar zenith angle and population density of different geographies influence the data diversity. These factors conjointly render suboptimal aerial-visual perception of the deep neural network (DNN) models trained primarily on the ground view data including the open-world foundational models. To pave the way for a transformative era of aerial detection we present Multiview Aerial Visual RECognition (MAVREC) a video dataset where we record synchronized scenes from different perspectives --- ground camera and drone-mounted camera. MAVREC consists of around 2.5 hours of industry-standard 2.7K resolution video sequences more than 0.5 million frames and 1.1 million annotated bounding boxes. This makes MAVREC the largest ground and aerial view dataset and the fourth largest among all drone-based datasets across all modalities and tasks. Through our extensive benchmarking on MAVREC we recognize that augmenting object detectors with ground view images from the corresponding geographical location is a superior pre-training strategy for aerial detection. Building on this strategy we benchmark MAVREC with a curriculum-based semi-supervised object detection approach that leverages labeled (ground and aerial) and unlabeled (only aerial) images to enhance aerial detection."},

To fill this gap we propose a family of HDR quality metrics in which the key step is employing a simple inverse display model to decompose an HDR image into a stack of LDR images with varying exposures. Subsequently these decomposed images are assessed through well-established LDR quality metrics. Our HDR quality models present three distinct benefits. First they directly inherit the recent advancements of LDR quality metrics. Second they do not rely on human perceptual data of HDR image quality for re-calibration. Third they facilitate the alignment and prioritization of specific luminance ranges for more accurate and detailed quality assessment. Experimental results show that our HDR quality metrics consistently outperform existing models in terms of quality assessment on four HDR image quality datasets and perceptual optimization of HDR novel view synthesis."},

Previous methods start by training a reward model that aligns with human preferences then leverage RL techniques to fine-tune the underlying models. However crafting an efficient reward model demands extensive datasets optimal architecture and manual hyperparameter tuning making the process both time and cost-intensive. The direct preference optimization (DPO) method effective in fine-tuning large language models eliminates the necessity for a reward model. However the extensive GPU memory requirement of the diffusion model's denoising process hinders the direct application of the DPO method. To address this issue we introduce the Direct Preference for Denoising Diffusion Policy Optimization (D3PO) method to directly fine-tune diffusion models. The theoretical analysis demonstrates that although D3PO omits training a reward model it effectively functions as the optimal reward model trained using human feedback data to guide the learning process. This approach requires no training of a reward model proving to be more direct cost-effective and minimizing computational overhead. In experiments our method uses the relative scale of objectives as a proxy for human preference delivering comparable results to methods using ground-truth rewards.

In this paper we propose an eXplicit vessel-fiber modeling method for Fibrosis staging from liver biopsy images namely XFibrosis. Specifically we transform vessels and fibers into graph-structured representations where their micro-structures are depicted by vessel-induced primal graphs and fiber-induced dual graphs respectively. Moreover the fiber-induced dual graphs also represent the connectivity information between vessels caused by fiber deposition.

To address this issue we propose an explicit Content Decoupling framework for IR dubbed CoDe to end-to-end model the restoration process by utilizing decoupled content components in a divide-and-conquer-like architecture. Specifically a Content Decoupling Module is first designed to decouple content components of inputs and outputs according to the frequency spectra adaptively generated from the transform domain. In addition in order to harness the divide-and-conquer strategy for reconstructing decoupled content components we propose an IR Network Container.

DCNv4 addresses the limitations of its predecessor DCNv3 with two key enhancements: 1. removing softmax normalization in spatial aggregation to enhance its dynamic property and expressive power and 2. optimizing memory access to minimize redundant operations for speedup. These improvements result in a significantly faster convergence compared to DCNv3 and a substantial increase in processing speed with DCNv4 achieving more than three times the forward speed. DCNv4 demonstrates exceptional performance across various tasks including image classification instance and semantic segmentation and notably image generation. When integrated into generative models like U-Net in the latent diffusion model DCNv4 outperforms its baseline underscoring its possibility to enhance generative models. In practical applications replacing DCNv3 with DCNv4 in the InternImage model to create FlashInternImage results in up to 80% speed increase and further performance improvement without further modifications. The advancements in speed and efficiency of DCNv4 combined with its robust performance across diverse vision tasks show its potential as a foundational building block for future vision models."},

This process requires users to articulate their ideas in words that are both comprehensible to the models and accurately capture their vision posing difficulties for many users.

{"title": "Local-consistent Transformation Learning for Rotation-invariant Point Cloud Analysis", "authors": "Yiyang Chen, Lunhao Duan, Shanshan Zhao, Changxing Ding, Dacheng Tao", "abstract": "Rotation invariance is an important requirement for point shape analysis. To achieve this current state-of-the-art methods attempt to construct the local rotation-invariant representation through learning or defining the local reference frame (LRF). Although efficient these LRF-based methods suffer from perturbation of local geometric relations resulting in suboptimal local rotation invariance. To alleviate this issue we propose a Local-consistent Transformation (LocoTrans) learning strategy. Specifically we first construct the local-consistent reference frame (LCRF) by considering the symmetry of the two axes in LRF. In comparison with previous LRFs our LCRF is able to preserve local geometric relationships better through performing local-consistent transformation. However as the consistency only exists in local regions the relative pose information is still lost in the intermediate layers of the network. We mitigate such a relative pose issue by developing a relative pose recovery (RPR) module. RPR aims to restore the relative pose between adjacent transformed patches. Equipped with LCRF and RPR our LocoTrans is capable of learning local-consistent transformation and preserving local geometry which benefits rotation invariance learning. Competitive performance under arbitrary rotations on both shape classification and part segmentation tasks and ablations can demonstrate the effectiveness of our method. Code will be available publicly at https://github.com/wdttt/LocoTrans."},

Departing from conventional methods we introduce a 3D multi-frame perspective to generate stabilized images addressing the challenge of full-frame generation while preserving structure. The core of our RStab framework lies in Stabilized Rendering (SR) a volume rendering module fusing multi-frame information in 3D space. Specifically SR involves warping features and colors from multiple frames by projection fusing them into descriptors to render the stabilized image. However the precision of warped information depends on the projection accuracy a factor significantly influenced by dynamic regions. In response we introduce the Adaptive Ray Range (ARR) module to integrate depth priors adaptively defining the sampling range for the projection process. Additionally we propose Color Correction (CC) assisting geometric constraints with optical flow for accurate color aggregation. Thanks to the three modules our RStab demonstrates superior performance compared with previous stabilizers in the field of view (FOV) image quality and video stability across various datasets."},

However matching noise within and between images along with inconsistent keypoint detection frequently degrades the matching performance. We review these problems and thus propose: 1) a novel and unified Filtering and Calibrating (FC) approach that jointly rejects outliers and optimizes inliers and 2) leveraging both the matching context and the underlying image texture to remove matching uncertainties. Under the guidance of the above innovations we construct Filtering and Calibrating Graph Neural Network (FC-GNN) which follows the FC approach to recover reliable and accurate correspondences from various interferences. FC-GNN conducts an effectively combined inference of contextual and local information through careful embedding and multiple information aggregations predicting confidence scores and calibration offsets for the input correspondences to jointly filter out outliers and improve pixel-level matching accuracy. Moreover we exploit the local coherence of matches to perform inference on local graphs thereby reducing computational complexity. Overall FC-GNN operates at lightning speed and can greatly boost the performance of diverse matching pipelines across various tasks showcasing the immense potential of such approaches to become standard and pivotal components of image matching.

Bouman", "abstract": "Refractive Index Tomography is the inverse problem of reconstructing the continuously-varying 3D refractive index in a scene using 2D projected image measurements. Although a purely refractive field is not directly visible it bends light rays as they travel through space thus providing a signal for reconstruction. The effects of such fields appear in many scientific computer vision settings ranging from refraction due to transparent cells in microscopy to the lensing of distant galaxies caused by dark matter in astrophysics. Reconstructing these fields is particularly difficult due to the complex nonlinear effects of the refractive field on observed images. Furthermore while standard 3D reconstruction and tomography settings typically have access to observations of the scene from many viewpoints many refractive index tomography problem settings only have access to images observed from a single viewpoint. We introduce a method that leverages prior knowledge of light sources scattered throughout the refractive medium to help disambiguate the single-view refractive index tomography problem. We differentiably trace curved rays through a neural field representation of the refractive field and optimize its parameters to best reproduce the observed image. We demonstrate the efficacy of our approach by reconstructing simulated refractive fields analyze the effects of light source distribution on the recovered field and test our method on a simulated dark matter mapping problem where we successfully recover the 3D refractive field caused by a realistic dark matter distribution."},

While most existing work assumes a simple and fixed degradation model (e.g. bicubic downsampling) the research of Blind SR seeks to improve model generalization ability with unknown degradation. Recently Kong et al. pioneer the investigation of a more suitable training strategy for Blind SR using Dropout. Although such method indeed brings substantial generalization improvements via mitigating overfitting we argue that Dropout simultaneously introduces undesirable side-effect that compromises model's capacity to faithfully reconstruct fine details. We show both the theoretical and experimental analyses in our paper and furthermore we present another easy yet effective training strategy that enhances the generalization ability of the model by simply modulating its first and second-order features statistics. Experimental results have shown that our method could serve as a model-agnostic regularization and outperforms Dropout on seven benchmark datasets including both synthetic and real-world scenarios."},
{"title": "Distilling ODE Solvers of Diffusion Models into Smaller Steps", "authors": "Sanghwan Kim, Hao Tang, Fisher Yu", "abstract": "Abstract Diffusion models have recently gained prominence as a novel category of generative models. Despite their success these models face a notable drawback in terms of slow sampling speeds requiring a high number of function evaluations (NFE) in the order of hundreds or thousands. In response both learning-free and learning-based sampling strategies have been explored to expedite the sampling process. Learning-free sampling employs various ordinary differential equation (ODE) solvers based on the formulation of diffusion ODEs. However it encounters challenges in faithfully tracking the true sampling trajectory particularly for small NFE. Conversely learning-based sampling methods such as knowledge distillation demand extensive additional training limiting their practical applicability. To overcome these limitations we introduce Distilled-ODE solvers (D-ODE solvers) a straightforward distillation approach grounded in ODE solver formulations. Our method seamlessly integrates the strengths of both learning-free and learning-based sampling. D-ODE solvers are constructed by introducing a single parameter adjustment to existing ODE solvers. Furthermore we optimize D-ODE solvers with smaller steps using knowledge distillation from ODE solvers with larger steps across a batch of samples. Comprehensive experiments demonstrate the superior performance of D-ODE solvers compared to existing ODE solvers including DDIM PNDM DPM-Solver DEIS and EDM particularly in scenarios with fewer NFE. Notably our method incurs negligible computational overhead compared to previous distillation techniques facilitating straightforward and rapid integration with existing samplers. Qualitative analysis reveals that D-ODE solvers not only enhance image quality but also faithfully follow the target ODE trajectory."},

Utilizing a forward warping approach OCAI employs occlusion awareness to resolve ambiguities in pixel values and fills in missing values by leveraging the forward-backward consistency of optical flows. Additionally we introduce a teacher-student style semi-supervised learning method on top of the interpolated frames. Using a pair of unlabeled frames and the teacher model's predicted optical flow we generate interpolated frames and flows to train a student model. The teacher's weights are maintained using Exponential Moving Averaging of the student.

Despite this prior work has shown that an attacker at the server can still reconstruct the private training data using only the client updates. These attacks are known as data reconstruction attacks and fall into two major categories: gradient inversion (GI) and linear layer leakage attacks (LLL). However despite demonstrating the effectiveness of these attacks in breaching privacy prior work has not investigated the usefulness of the reconstructed data for downstream tasks. In this work we explore data reconstruction attacks through the lens of training and improving models with leaked data. We demonstrate the effectiveness of both GI and LLL attacks in maliciously training models using the leaked data more accurately than a benign federated learning strategy. Counter-intuitively this bump in training quality can occur despite limited reconstruction quality or a small total number of leaked images. Finally we show the limitations of these attacks for downstream training individually for GI attacks and for LLL attacks."},

The problem is challenging due to the complicated heterogeneous relationships between 2D and 3D data. Moreover label scarcity in real-world applications hinders from generating discriminative representations. In this paper we propose a semi-supervised approach named Fine-grained Prototypcical Voting with Heterogeneous Mixup (FIVE) which maps both 2D and 3D data into a common embedding space for cross-modal retrieval. Specifically we generate fine-grained prototypes to model inter-class variation for both 2D and 3D data. Then considering each unlabeled sample as a query we retrieve relevant prototypes to vote for reliable and robust pseudo-labels which serve as guidance for discriminative learning under label scarcity. Furthermore to bridge the semantic gap between two modalities we mix cross-modal pairs with similar semantics in the embedding space and then perform similarity learning for cross-modal discrepancy reduction in a soft manner. The whole FIVE is optimized with the consideration of sharpness to mitigate the impact of potential label noise. Extensive experiments on benchmark datasets validate the superiority of FIVE compared with a range of baselines in different settings. On average FIVE outperforms the second-best approach by 4.74% on 3D MNIST 12.94% on ModelNet10 and 22.10% on ModelNet40."},
{"title": "Logit Standardization in Knowledge Distillation", "authors": "Shangquan Sun, Wenqi Ren, Jingzhi Li, Rui Wang, Xiaochun Cao", "abstract": "Knowledge distillation involves transferring soft labels from a teacher to a student using a shared temperature-based softmax function. However the assumption of a shared temperature between teacher and student implies a mandatory exact match between their logits in terms of logit range and variance. This side-effect limits the performance of student considering the capacity discrepancy between them and the finding that the innate logit relations of teacher are sufficient for student to learn. To address this issue we propose setting the temperature as the weighted standard deviation of logit and performing a plug-and-play Z-score pre-process of logit standardization before applying softmax and Kullback-Leibler divergence. Our pre-process enables student to focus on essential logit relations from teacher rather than requiring a magnitude match and can improve the performance of existing logit-based distillation methods. We also show a typical case where the conventional setting of sharing temperature between teacher and student cannot reliably yield the authentic distillation evaluation; nonetheless this challenge is successfully alleviated by our Z-score. We extensively evaluate our method for various student and teacher models on CIFAR-100 and ImageNet showing its significant superiority. The vanilla knowledge distillation powered by our pre-process can achieve favorable performance against state-of-the-art methods and other distillation variants can obtain considerable gain with the assistance of our pre-process.

Our work is motivated by the human ability to intuitively understand postures from a single image or a brief description a process that intertwines image interpretation world knowledge and an understanding of body language. Traditional human pose estimation and generation methods often operate in isolation lacking semantic understanding and reasoning abilities. ChatPose addresses these limitations by embedding SMPL poses as distinct signal tokens within a multimodal LLM enabling the direct generation of 3D body poses from both textual and visual inputs. Leveraging the powerful capabilities of multimodal LLMs ChatPose unifies classical 3D human pose and generation tasks while offering user interactions.

These tasks involve reasoning about humans to generate 3D poses from subtle text queries possibly accompanied by images. We establish benchmarks for these tasks moving beyond traditional 3D pose generation and estimation methods.

In most previous works visual navigation is usually assumed to be done in a static and ideal environment: the target is always reachable with no need to alter the environment. However the \"messy\" environments are more general and practical in our daily lives where the agent may get blocked by obstacles. Thus Interactive Navigation (InterNav) is introduced to navigate to the objects in more realistic \"messy\" environments according to the object interaction. Prior work on InterNav learns short-term interaction through extensive trials with reinforcement learning. However interaction does not guarantee efficient navigation that is planning obstacle interactions that make shorter paths and consume less effort is also crucial. In this paper we introduce an effect-oriented affordance map to enable long-term interactive navigation extending the existing map-based navigation framework to the domain of dynamic environment. We train a set of affordance functions predicting available interactions and the time cost of removing obstacles which informatively support an interactive modular system to address interaction and long-term planning.

However previous endeavors in this field have either necessitated additional training or fine-tuning processes or require that the models possess the same pre-trained initialization. In this work we identify a common drawback in prior works w.r.t. the inconsistency of unit similarity in the weight space and the activation space. To address this inconsistency we propose an innovative model merging framework coined as merging under dual-space constraints (MuDSC). Specifically instead of solely maximizing the objective of a single space we advocate for the exploration of permutation matrices situated in a region with a unified high similarity in the dual space achieved through the linear combination of activation and weight similarity matrices. In order to enhance usability we have also incorporated adaptations for group structure including Multi-Head Attention and Group Normalization.

Neural radiance fields (NeRF) while popular for view synthesis and 3D reconstruction are typically reliant on multi-view images. Existing methods for single-view 3D reconstruction with NeRF rely on either data priors to hallucinate views of occluded regions which may not be physically accurate or shadows observed by RGB cameras which are difficult to detect in ambient light and low albedo backgrounds. We propose using time-of-flight data captured by a single-photon avalanche diode to overcome these limitations. Our method models two-bounce optical paths with NeRF using lidar transient data for supervision. By leveraging the advantages of both NeRF and two-bounce light measured by lidar we demonstrate that we can reconstruct visible and occluded geometry without data priors or reliance on controlled ambient lighting or scene albedo. In addition we demonstrate improved generalization under practical constraints on sensor spatial- and temporal-resolution. We believe our method is a promising direction as single-photon lidars become ubiquitous on consumer devices such as phones tablets and headsets."},
{"title": "Toward Generalist Anomaly Detection via In-context Residual Learning with Few-shot Sample Prompts", "authors": "Jiawen Zhu, Guansong Pang", "abstract": "This paper explores the problem of Generalist Anomaly Detection (GAD) aiming to train one single detection model that can generalize to detect anomalies in diverse datasets from different application domains without any further training on the target data. Some recent studies have shown that large pre-trained Visual-Language Models (VLMs) like CLIP have strong generalization capabilities on detecting industrial defects from various datasets but their methods rely heavily on handcrafted text prompts about defects making them difficult to generalize to anomalies in other applications e.g. medical image anomalies or semantic anomalies in natural images. In this work we propose to train a GAD model with few-shot normal images as sample prompts for AD on diverse datasets on the fly. To this end we introduce a novel approach that learns an in-context residual learning model for GAD termed InCTRL. It is trained on an auxiliary dataset to discriminate anomalies from normal samples based on a holistic evaluation of the residuals between query images and few-shot normal sample prompts. Regardless of the datasets per definition of anomaly larger residuals are expected for anomalies than normal samples thereby enabling InCTRL to generalize across different domains without further training. Comprehensive experiments on nine AD datasets are performed to establish a GAD benchmark that encapsulate the detection of industrial defect anomalies medical anomalies and semantic anomalies in both one-vs-all and multi-class setting on which InCTRL is the best performer and significantly outperforms state-of-the-art competing methods.

Recently transformers have been used for registration and outperformed Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs). Transformers can capture long-range dependence among image features which have been shown beneficial for registration. However due to the high computation/memory loads of self-attention transformers are typically used at downsampled feature resolutions and cannot capture fine-grained long-range dependence at the full image resolution. This limits deformable registration as it necessitates precise dense correspondence between each image pixel. Multi-layer Perceptrons (MLPs) without self-attention are efficient in computation/memory usage enabling the feasibility of capturing fine-grained long-range dependence at full resolution. Nevertheless MLPs have not been extensively explored for image registration and are lacking the consideration of inductive bias crucial for medical registration tasks. In this study we propose the first correlation-aware MLP-based registration network (CorrMLP) for deformable medical image registration. Our CorrMLP introduces a correlation-aware multi-window MLP block in a novel coarse-to-fine registration architecture which captures fine-grained multi-range dependence to perform correlation-aware coarse-to-fine registration. Extensive experiments with seven public medical datasets show that our CorrMLP outperforms state-of-the-art deformable registration methods."},

This capability requires instance tracking in real-world 3D scenes from egocentric videos (IT3DEgo). We explore this problem by first introducing a new benchmark dataset consisting of RGB and depth videos per-frame camera pose and instance-level annotations in both 2D camera and 3D world coordinates. We present an evaluation protocol which evaluates tracking performance in 3D coordinates with two settings for enrolling instances to track: (1) single-view online enrollment where an instance is specified on-the-fly based on the human wearer's interactions. and (2) multi-view pre-enrollment where images of an instance to be tracked are stored in memory ahead of time. To address IT3DEgo we first re-purpose methods from relevant areas e.g. single object tracking (SOT) -- running SOT methods to track instances in 2D frames and lifting them to 3D using camera pose and depth. We also present a simple method that leverages pretrained segmentation and detection models to generate proposals from RGB frames and match proposals with enrolled instance images. Our experiments show that our method (with no finetuning) significantly outperforms SOT-based approaches in the egocentric setting. We conclude by arguing that the problem of egocentric instance tracking is made easier by leveraging camera pose and using a 3D allocentric (world) coordinate representation."},

Specifically we address the challenge of scarce loose-wear IMU training data by proposing a Secondary Motion AutoEncoder (SeMo-AE) that learns to model and synthesize the effects of secondary motion between the skin and loose clothing on IMU data. SeMo-AE is leveraged to generate a diverse synthetic dataset of loose-wear IMU data to augment training for the pose estimation network and significantly improve its accuracy. For validation we collected a dataset with various subjects and 2 wearing styles (zipped and unzipped). Experimental results demonstrate that our approach maintains high-quality real-time posture estimation even in loose-wear scenarios."},

Obtaining RGB-D scene information over a short imaging distance in an ultra-compact form factor and in a passive snapshot manner is challenging. Dual-pixel (DP) sensors are a potential solution to achieve the same. DP sensors collect light rays from two different halves of the lens in two interleaved pixel arrays thus capturing two slightly different views of the scene like a stereo camera system. However imaging with a DP sensor implies that the defocus blur size is directly proportional to the disparity seen between the views. This creates a trade-off between disparity estimation vs. deblurring accuracy. To improve this trade-off effect we propose CADS (Coded Aperture Dual-Pixel Sensing) in which we use a coded aperture in the imaging lens along with a DP sensor. In our approach we jointly learn an optimal coded pattern and the reconstruction algorithm in an end-to-end optimization setting. Our resulting CADS imaging system demonstrates improvement of >1.5dB PSNR in all-in-focus (AIF) estimates and 5-6% in depth estimation quality over naive DP sensing for a wide range of aperture settings. Furthermore we build the proposed CADS prototypes for DSLR photography settings and in an endoscope and a dermoscope form factor. Our novel coded dual-pixel sensing approach demonstrates accurate RGB-D reconstruction results in simulations and real-world experiments in a passive snapshot and compact manner."},

This process typically involves two stages: 1) estimating the essential matrix between the views and 2) disambiguating among the four candidate relative poses that satisfy the epipolar geometry. In this paper we demonstrate a novel approach that for the first time bypasses the second stage. Specifically we show that it is possible to directly estimate the correct relative camera pose from correspondences without needing a post-processing step to enforce the cheirality constraint on the correspondences. Building on recent advances in certifiable non-minimal optimization we frame the relative pose estimation as a Quadratically Constrained Quadratic Program (QCQP). By applying the appropriate constraints we ensure the estimation of a camera pose that corresponds to a valid 3D geometry and that is globally optimal when certified. We validate our method through exhaustive synthetic and real-world experiments confirming the efficacy efficiency and accuracy of the proposed approach.

Existing animation works typically employ the frame-warping technique to animate the reference image towards the target motion. Despite achieving reasonable results these approaches face challenges in maintaining temporal consistency throughout the animation due to the lack of temporal modeling and poor preservation of reference identity. In this work we introduce MagicAnimate a diffusion-based framework that aims at enhancing temporal consistency preserving reference image faithfully and improving animation fidelity. To achieve this we first develop a video diffusion model to encode temporal information. Second to maintain the appearance coherence across frames we introduce a novel appearance encoder to retain the intricate details of the reference image. Leveraging these two innovations we further employ a simple video fusion technique to encourage smooth transitions for long video animation. Empirical results demonstrate the superiority of our method over baseline approaches on two benchmarks. Notably our approach outperforms the strongest baseline by over 38% in terms of video fidelity on the challenging TikTok dancing dataset.

{"title": "Decoupling Static and Hierarchical Motion Perception for Referring Video Segmentation", "authors": "Shuting He, Henghui Ding", "abstract": "Referring video segmentation relies on natural language expressions to identify and segment objects often emphasizing motion clues. Previous works treat a sentence as a whole and directly perform identification at the video-level mixing up static image-level cues with temporal motion cues. However image-level features cannot well comprehend motion cues in sentences and static cues are not crucial for temporal perception. In fact static cues can sometimes interfere with temporal perception by overshadowing motion cues. In this work we propose to decouple video-level referring expression understanding into static and motion perception with a specific emphasis on enhancing temporal comprehension. Firstly we introduce an expression-decoupling module to make static cues and motion cues perform their distinct role alleviating the issue of sentence embeddings overlooking motion cues. Secondly we propose a hierarchical motion perception module to capture temporal information effectively across varying timescales. Furthermore we employ contrastive learning to distinguish the motions of visually similar objects. These contributions yield state-of-the-art performance across five datasets including a remarkable 9.2% J&F improvement on the challenging MeViS dataset."},

They apply uni-directional attention to capture sequential dependencies and generate task sequences recursively. However such autoregressive Transformers may not fit vision tasks well as vision task sequences usually lack the sequential dependencies typically observed in natural languages. In this work we design Masked AutoDecoder (MAD) an effective multi-task vision generalist. MAD consists of two core designs. First we develop a parallel decoding framework that introduces bi-directional attention to capture contextual dependencies comprehensively and decode vision task sequences in parallel. Second we design a masked sequence modeling approach that learns rich task contexts by masking and reconstructing task sequences. In this way MAD handles all the tasks by a single network branch and a simple cross-entropy loss with minimal task-specific designs. Extensive experiments demonstrate the great potential of MAD as a new paradigm for unifying various vision tasks. MAD achieves superior performance and inference efficiency compared to autoregressive counterparts while obtaining competitive accuracy with task-specific models.

However the weakly misalignment problem between multimodal image pairs limits its performance in object detection. Most existing methods often ignore the modality gap and emphasize a strict alignment resulting in an upper bound of alignment quality and an increase of implementation costs. To address these challenges we propose a novel method named Offset-guided Adaptive Feature Alignment (OAFA) which could adaptively adjust the relative positions between multimodal features. Considering the impact of modality gap on the cross-modality spatial matching a Cross-modality Spatial Offset Modeling (CSOM) module is designed to establish a common subspace to estimate the precise feature-level offsets. Then an Offset-guided Deformable Alignment and Fusion (ODAF) module is utilized to implicitly capture optimal fusion positions for detection task rather than conducting a strict alignment. Comprehensive experiments demonstrate that our method not only achieves state-of-the-art performance in the UAVs-based object detection task but also shows strong robustness to the weakly misalignment problem."},
{"title": "Dense Vision Transformer Compression with Few Samples", "authors": "Hanxiao Zhang, Yifan Zhou, Guo-Hua Wang", "abstract": "Few-shot model compression aims to compress a large model into a more compact one with only a tiny training set (even without labels). Block-level pruning has recently emerged as a leading technique in achieving high accuracy and low latency in few-shot CNN compression. But few-shot compression for Vision Transformers (ViT) remains largely unexplored which presents a new challenge. In particular the issue of sparse compression exists in traditional CNN few-shot methods which can only produce very few compressed models of different model sizes. This paper proposes a novel framework for few-shot ViT compression named DC-ViT. Instead of dropping the entire block DC-ViT selectively eliminates the attention module while retaining and reusing portions of the MLP module. DC-ViT enables dense compression which outputs numerous compressed models that densely populate the range of model complexity. DC-ViT outperforms state-of-the-art few-shot compression methods by a significant margin of 10 percentage points along with lower latency in the compression of ViT and its variants."},

To tackle this challenge we introduce MorpheuS a framework for dynamic 360deg surface reconstruction from a casually captured RGB-D video. Our approach models the target scene as a canonical field that encodes its geometry and appearance in conjunction with a deformation field that warps points from the current frame to the canonical space. We leverage a view-dependent diffusion prior and distill knowledge from it to achieve realistic completion of unobserved regions.

However they often come with high computational complexity and large memory costs which hinder their applications on resource-limited devices. In this paper we explore the feasibility of applying the extremely compact binary neural network (BNN) to low-light raw video enhancement. Nevertheless there are two main issues with binarizing video enhancement models. One is how to fuse the temporal information to improve low-light denoising without complex modules. The other is how to narrow the performance gap between binary convolutions with the full precision ones. To address the first issue we introduce a spatial-temporal shift operation which is easy-to-binarize and effective. The temporal shift efficiently aggregates the features of neighbor frames and the spatial shift handles the misalignment caused by the large motion in videos. For the second issue we present a distribution-aware binary convolution which captures the distribution characteristics of real-valued input and incorporates them into plain binary convolutions to alleviate the degradation in performance. Extensive quantitative and qualitative experiments have shown our high-efficiency binarized low-light raw video enhancement method can attain a promising performance.

Although empirically effective methods have approached this problem via score debiasing or prompt engineering a more rigorous perspective to explain and tackle this problem remains elusive. In this paper we reveal that the existing score distillation-based text-to-3D generation frameworks degenerate to maximal likelihood seeking on each view independently and thus suffer from the mode collapse problem manifesting as the Janus artifact in practice. To tame mode collapse we improve score distillation by re-establishing the entropy term in the corresponding variational objective which is applied to the distribution of rendered images. Maximizing the entropy encourages diversity among different views in generated 3D assets thereby mitigating the Janus problem. Based on this new objective we derive a new update rule for 3D score distillation dubbed Entropic Score Distillation (ESD). We theoretically reveal that ESD can be simplified and implemented by just adopting the classifier-free guidance trick upon variational score distillation. Although embarrassingly straightforward our extensive experiments demonstrate that ESD can be an effective treatment for Janus artifacts in score distillation."},

Existing methods for bridging this gap such as domain adaptation (DA) may require the source data on which the model was trained (often not available) while others i.e. source-free DA require many passes through the testing data. We propose an online test-time adaptation method for depth completion the task of inferring a dense depth map from a single image and associated sparse depth map that closes the performance gap in a single pass. We first present a study on how the domain shift in each data modality affects model performance. Based on our observations that the sparse depth modality exhibits a much smaller covariate shift than the image we design an embedding module trained in the source domain that preserves a mapping from features encoding only sparse depth to those encoding image and sparse depth. During test time sparse depth features are projected using this map as a proxy for source domain features and are used as guidance to train a set of auxiliary parameters (i.e. adaptation layer) to align image and sparse depth features from the target test domain to that of the source domain. We evaluate our method on indoor and outdoor scenarios and show that it improves over baselines by an average of 21.1%. Code available at https://github.com/seobbro/TTA-depth-completion."},

Existing works eg. ImageBind treat the image as the central modality and build an image-centered representation space; however the space may be sub-optimal as it leads to an unbalanced representation space among all modalities. Moreover the category names are directly used to extract text embeddings for the downstream tasks making it hardly possible to represent the semantics of multi-modal data. The 'out-of-the-box' insight of our UniBind is to make the alignment center modality-agnostic and further learn a unified and balanced representation space empowered by the large language models (LLMs). UniBind is superior in its flexible application to all CLIP-style models and delivers remarkable performance boosts. To make this possible we 1) construct a knowledge base of text embeddings with the help of LLMs and multi-modal LLMs; 2) adaptively build LLM-augmented class-wise embedding center on top of the knowledge base and encoded visual embeddings; 3) align all the embeddings to the LLM-augmented embedding center via contrastive learning to achieve a unified and balanced representation space. UniBind shows strong zero-shot recognition performance gains over prior arts by an average of 6.36%. Finally we achieve new state-of-the-art performance eg. a 6.75% gain on ImageNet on the multi-modal fine-tuning setting while reducing 90% of the learnable parameters."},

Conventional quantization frameworks learn shared quantization functions for tensor discretization regardless of the generation timesteps in diffusion models while the activation distribution differs significantly across various timesteps. Meanwhile the calibration images are acquired in random timesteps which fail to provide sufficient information for generalizable quantization function learning. Both issues cause sizable quantization errors with obvious image generation performance degradation. On the contrary we design distribution-aware quantization functions for activation discretization in different timesteps and search the optimal timesteps for informative calibration image generation so that our quantized diffusion model can reduce the discretization errors with negligible computational overhead. Specifically we partition various timestep quantization functions into different groups according to the importance weights which are optimized by differentiable search algorithms. We also extend structural risk minimization principle for informative calibration image generation to enhance the generalization ability in the deployment of quantized diffusion model.

CoMasTRe uses a two-stage segmenter learning class-agnostic mask proposals at the first stage and leaving recognition to the second stage. During continual learning a simple but effective distillation is adopted to strengthen objectness.

Our key insight is that explicit shape can reduce the sampling points used to fit implicit representation and frozen blending weights from SMPL constructing a generalized rigid deformation can effectively avoid overfitting and improve pose generalization performance. Our architecture involving both explicit and implicit representation is simple yet effective.

However these methods face significant challenges in background interpretation and model overfitting and thus often result in the loss of crucial background knowledge giving rise to sub-optimal inference performance of the detector. To mitigate these issues we present a novel OVD framework termed LBP to propose learning background prompts to harness explored implicit background knowledge thus enhancing the detection performance w.r.t. base and novel categories.

For example although CLIP achieves impressive accuracy on ImageNet (60-80%) its performance drops below 10% for more than ten concepts like night snake presumably due to their limited presence in the pretraining data. However measuring the frequency of concepts in VLMs' large-scale datasets is challenging. We address this by using large language models (LLMs) to count the number of pretraining texts that contain synonyms of these concepts. Our analysis confirms that popular datasets such as LAION exhibit a long-tailed concept distribution yielding biased performance in VLMs. We also find that downstream applications of VLMs including visual chatbots (e.g. GPT-4V) and text-to-image models (e.g. Stable Diffusion) often fail to recognize or generate images of rare concepts identified by our method. To mitigate the imbalanced performance of zero-shot VLMs we propose REtrieval-Augmented Learning (REAL). First instead of prompting VLMs using the original class names REAL uses their most frequent synonyms found in pretraining texts.

Existing approaches either leverage large text-to-image models to optimize a 3D representation or train 3D generators on object-centric datasets. Generating entire scenes however remains very challenging as a scene contains multiple 3D objects diverse and scattered. In this work we introduce SceneWiz3D - a novel approach to synthesize high-fidelity 3D scenes from text. We marry the locality of objects with globality of scenes by introducing a hybrid 3D representation - explicit for objects and implicit for scenes. Remarkably an object being represented explicitly can be either generated from text using conventional text-to-3D approaches or provided by users. To configure the layout of the scene and automatically place objects we apply the Particle Swarm Optimization technique during the optimization process. Furthermore it is difficult for certain parts of the scene (e.g. corners occlusion) to receive multi-view supervision leading to inferior geometry. We incorporate an RGBD panorama diffusion model to mitigate it resulting in high-quality geometry. Extensive evaluation supports that our approach achieves superior quality over previous approaches enabling the generation of detailed and view-consistent 3D scenes.

Black", "abstract": "We propose EMAGE a framework to generate full-body human gestures from audio and masked gestures encompassing facial local body hands and global movements. To achieve this we first introduce BEAT2 (BEAT-SMPLX-FLAME) a new mesh-level holistic co-speech dataset. BEAT2 combines a MoShed SMPL-X body with FLAME head parameters and further refines the modeling of head neck and finger movements offering a community-standardized high-quality 3D motion captured dataset. EMAGE leverages masked body gesture priors during training to boost inference performance. It involves a Masked Audio Gesture Transformer facilitating joint training on audio-to-gesture generation and masked gesture reconstruction to effectively encode audio and body gesture hints. Encoded body hints from masked gestures are then separately employed to generate facial and body movements. Moreover EMAGE adaptively merges speech features from the audio's rhythm and content and utilizes four compositional VQ-VAEs to enhance the results' fidelity and diversity. Experiments demonstrate that EMAGE generates holistic gestures with state-of-the-art performance and is flexible in accepting predefined spatial-temporal gesture inputs generating complete audio-synchronized results.

We investigate this phenomenon usually referred to as \"hallucination\" and show that it stems from an excessive reliance on the language prior. In particular we show that as more tokens are generated the reliance on the visual prompt decreases and this behavior strongly correlates with the emergence of hallucinations. To reduce hallucinations we introduce Multi-Modal Mutual-Information Decoding (M3ID) a new sampling method for prompt amplification. M3ID amplifies the influence of the reference image over the language prior hence favoring the generation of tokens with higher mutual information with the visual prompt. M3ID can be applied to any pre-trained autoregressive VLM at inference time without necessitating further training and with minimal computational overhead. If training is an option we show that M3ID can be paired with Direct Preference Optimization (DPO) to improve the model's reliance on the prompt image without requiring any labels. Our empirical findings show that our algorithms maintain the fluency and linguistic capabilities of pre-trained VLMs while reducing hallucinations by mitigating visually ungrounded answers. Specifically for the LLaVA 13B model M3ID and M3ID+DPO reduce the percentage of hallucinated objects in captioning tasks by 25% and 28% respectively and improve the accuracy on VQA benchmarks such as POPE by 21% and 24%."},

To synthesize long and complex curves our vector diffusion model uses a transformer architecture and a novel vector representation that enables the modeling of diverse vector geometry and the precise prediction of control points.

However existing methods primarily rely on cosine similarity for alignment which may not fully capture the complex relationship between medical images and reports. To address this gap we introduce a novel approach called Cross-Attention Alignment for Radiology Zero-Shot Classification (CARZero). Our approach innovatively leverages cross-attention mechanisms to process image and report features creating a Similarity Representation that more accurately reflects the intricate relationships in medical semantics. This representation is then linearly projected to form an image-text similarity matrix for cross-modality alignment. Additionally recognizing the pivotal role of prompt selection in zero-shot learning CARZero incorporates a Large Language Model-based prompt alignment strategy. This strategy standardizes diverse diagnostic expressions into a unified format for both training and inference phases overcoming the challenges of manual prompt design. Our approach is simple yet effective demonstrating state-of-the-art performance in zero-shot classification on five official chest radiograph diagnostic test sets including remarkable results on datasets with long-tail distributions of rare diseases.

Importantly the number of channels can range from one to a dozen and their correlation is often comparatively much lower than RGB as each of them brings specific information content. This aspect is largely overlooked by methods designed out of the bioimage field and current solutions mostly focus on intra-channel spatial attention often ignoring the relationship between channels yet crucial in most biological applications. Importantly the variable channel type and count prevent the projection of several experiments to a unified representation for large scale pre-training. In this study we propose ChAda-ViT a novel Channel Adaptive Vision Transformer architecture employing an Inter-Channel Attention mechanism on images with an arbitrary number order and type of channels. We also introduce IDRCell100k a bioimage dataset with a rich set of 79 experiments covering 7 microscope modalities with a multitude of channel types and channel counts varying from 1 to 10 per experiment. Our proposed architecture trained in a self-supervised manner outperforms existing approaches in several biologically relevant downstream tasks. Additionally it can be used to bridge the gap for the first time between assays with different microscopes channel numbers or types by embedding various image and experimental modalities into a unified biological image representation. The latter should facilitate interdisciplinary studies and pave the way for better adoption of deep learning in biological image-based analyses."},

Conventional methods representing the reference concepts using unique text embeddings often fail to accurately mimic the appearance of the reference. To address this one solution may be explicitly conditioning the reference images into the target denoising process known as key-value replacement. However prior works are constrained to local editing since they disrupt the structure path of the pre-trained T2I model. To overcome this we propose a novel plug-in method called DreamMatcher which reformulates T2I personalization as semantic matching. Specifically DreamMatcher replaces the target values with reference values aligned by semantic matching while leaving the structure path unchanged to preserve the versatile capability of pre-trained T2I models for generating diverse structures. We also introduce a semantic-consistent masking strategy to isolate the personalized concept from irrelevant regions introduced by the target prompts. Compatible with existing T2I models DreamMatcher shows significant improvements in complex scenarios. Intensive analyses demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach."},

The advent of deep multiple clustering techniques has notably advanced the performance by uncovering complex patterns and relationships within large datasets. However a major challenge arises as users often do not need all the clusterings that algorithms generate and figuring out the one needed requires a substantial understanding of each clustering result. Traditionally aligning a user's brief keyword of interest with the corresponding vision components was challenging but the emergence of multi-modal and large language models (LLMs) has begun to bridge this gap. In response given unlabeled target visual data we propose Multi-Map a novel method employing a multi-modal proxy learning process. It leverages CLIP encoders to extract coherent text and image embeddings with GPT-4 integrating users' interests to formulate effective textual contexts. Moreover reference word constraint and concept-level constraint are designed to learn the optimal text proxy according to the user's interest. Multi-Map not only adeptly captures a user's interest via a keyword but also facilitates identifying relevant clusterings.

Our investigation reveals that existing model probing methods perform well for the easy case when the source domain (where models are pre-trained) and the adapted domain are similar but fail for the difficult case when the two domains are significantly different. Simply incorporating features extracted from multiple layers and increasing complexity of the probing model can mitigate the gap in the difficult case but degrades the performance in the easy case. To address this challenge we propose structured model probing (SMP) that is able to deliver good performance for both cases through structured regularization. The regularization performs feature selection leveraging model structure as a prior and controls the complexity of the probing model through the weights of selected structures. This enables us to construct a simple adaptation model with a small number of selected features and a linear prediction model for the easy case; and to automatically increase the complexity of adaptation model with a large number of selected features and a non-linear model for the difficult case. Our extensive empirical studies show that SMP significantly outperforms the state-of-the-art methods for parameter efficient tuning and at the same time still maintains the advantage of computational efficiency for probing-based methods."},

Although many efforts have been made to utilize powerful CLIP models to accomplish this task they are still easily overfitting to training classes due to the natural gaps in semantic information between training and new classes. To overcome this challenge we propose a novel framework for open-vocabulary semantic segmentation called EBSeg incorporating an Adaptively Balanced Decoder (AdaB Decoder) and a Semantic Structure Consistency loss (SSC Loss). The AdaB Decoder is designed to generate different image embeddings for both training and new classes. Subsequently these two types of embeddings are adaptively balanced to fully exploit their ability to recognize training classes and generalization ability for new classes. To learn a consistent semantic structure from CLIP the SSC Loss aligns the inter-classes affinity in the image feature space with that in the text feature space of CLIP thereby improving the generalization ability of our model. Furthermore we employ a frozen SAM image encoder to complement the spatial information that CLIP features lack due to the low training image resolution and image-level supervision inherent in CLIP. Extensive experiments conducted across various benchmarks demonstrate that the proposed EBSeg outperforms the state-of-the-art methods.

While conceptually simple the problem quickly becomes challenging when multiple planes are visible in the image pair. Even with correct matches each individual plane (homography) might have a very low number of inliers when comparing to the set of all correspondences. In practice this requires a large number of RANSAC iterations to generate a good model hypothesis. The current state-of-the-art methods therefore seek to reduce the sample size from four point correspondences originally by including additional information such as keypoint orientation/angles or local affine information. In this work we continue in this direction and propose a novel one-point solver that leverages different approximate constraints derived from the same auxiliary information. In experiments we obtain state-of-the-art results with execution time speed-ups on large benchmark datasets and show that it is more beneficial for the solver to be sample efficient compared to generating more accurate homographies."},

In this work we propose Holo-Relighting a volumetric relighting method that is capable of synthesizing novel viewpoints and novel lighting from a single image. Holo-Relighting leverages the pretrained 3D GAN (EG3D) to reconstruct geometry and appearance from an input portrait as a set of 3D-aware features. We design a relighting module conditioned on a given lighting to process these features and predict a relit 3D representation in the form of a tri-plane which can render to an arbitrary viewpoint through volume rendering. Besides viewpoint and lighting control Holo-Relighting also takes the head pose as a condition to enable head-pose-dependent lighting effects. With these novel designs Holo-Relighting can generate complex non-Lambertian lighting effects (e.g. specular highlights and cast shadows) without using any explicit physical lighting priors. We train Holo-Relighting with data captured with a light stage and propose two data-rendering techniques to improve the data quality for training the volumetric relighting system.

With the new dataset we evaluate out-of-distribution (OOD) detection and model robustness. We find that existing OOD detection methods do not cope with the covariate shifts in ImageNet-ES implying that the definition and detection of OOD should be revisited to embrace real-world distribution shifts. We also observe that the model becomes more robust in both ImageNet-C and -ES by learning environment and sensor variations in addition to existing digital augmentations.

Departing from traditional numerical regression models which treat the trajectory coordinate sequence as continuous signals we consider them as discrete signals like text prompts. Specially we first transform an input space for the trajectory coordinate into the natural language space. Here the entire time-series trajectories of pedestrians are converted into a text prompt and scene images are described as text information through image captioning. The transformed numerical and image data are then wrapped into the question-answering template for use in a language model. Next to guide the language model in understanding and reasoning high-level knowledge such as scene context and social relationships between pedestrians we introduce an auxiliary multi-task question and answering. We then train a numerical tokenizer with the prompt data. We encourage the tokenizer to separate the integer and decimal parts well and leverage it to capture correlations between the consecutive numbers in the language model. Lastly we train the language model using the numerical tokenizer and all of the question-answer prompts.

However existing methods can hardly be extended to Cross-Modal Knowledge Distillation (CMKD) where the knowledge is transferred from a teacher modality to a different student modality with inference only on the distilled student modality. We empirically reveal that the modality gap i.e. modality imbalance and soft label misalignment incurs the ineffectiveness of traditional KD in CMKD. As a solution we propose a novel \\underline C ustomized \\underline C rossmodal \\underline K nowledge \\underline D istillation (C^2KD). Specifically to alleviate the modality gap the pre-trained teacher performs bidirectional distillation with the student to provide customized knowledge.

While existing models focus on minimizing a weighted sum of denoising score matching losses for data distribution modeling their training primarily emphasizes instance-level optimization overlooking valuable structural information within each mini-batch indicative of pair-wise relationships among samples. To address this limitation we introduce Structure-guided Adversarial training of Diffusion Models (SADM). In this pioneering approach we compel the model to learn manifold structures between samples in each training batch. To ensure the model captures authentic manifold structures in the data distribution we advocate adversarial training of the diffusion generator against a novel structure discriminator in a minimax game distinguishing real manifold structures from the generated ones. SADM substantially outperforms existing methods in image generation and cross-domain fine-tuning tasks across 12 datasets establishing a new state-of-the-art FID of 1.58 and 2.11 on ImageNet for class-conditional image generation at resolutions of 256x256 and 512x512 respectively."},

However an inherent flaw has come to light in these cutting-edge models: they tend to optimize the adjacency matrix jointly with the model weights. This process while seemingly efficient causes a gradual decay of bone connectivity data resulting in a model indifferent to the very topology it sought to represent. To remedy this we propose a two-fold strategy: (1) We introduce an innovative approach that encodes bone connectivity by harnessing the power of graph distances to describe the physical topology; we further incorporate action-specific topological representation via persistent homology analysis to depict systemic dynamics. This preserves the vital topological nuances often lost in conventional GCNs. (2) Our investigation also reveals the redundancy in existing GCNs for multi-relational modeling which we address by proposing an efficient refinement to Graph Convolutions (GC) - the BlockGC. This significantly reduces parameters while improving performance beyond original GCNs. Our full model BlockGCN establishes new benchmarks in skeleton-based action recognition across all model categories. Its high accuracy and lightweight design most notably on the large-scale NTU RGB+D 120 dataset stand as strong validation of the efficacy of BlockGCN."},

However existing text-to-SVG generation methods lack editability and struggle with visual quality and result diversity. To address these limitations we propose a novel text-guided vector graphics synthesis method called SVGDreamer. SVGDreamer incorporates a semantic-driven image vectorization (SIVE) process that enables the decomposition of synthesis into foreground objects and background thereby enhancing editability. Specifically the SIVE process introduces attention-based primitive control and an attention-mask loss function for effective control and manipulation of individual elements. Additionally we propose a Vectorized Particle-based Score Distillation (VPSD) approach to address issues of shape over-smoothing color over-saturation limited diversity and slow convergence of the existing text-to-SVG generation methods by modeling SVGs as distributions of control points and colors. Furthermore VPSD leverages a reward model to re-weight vector particles which improves aesthetic appeal and accelerates convergence. Extensive experiments are conducted to validate the effectiveness of SVGDreamer demonstrating its superiority over baseline methods in terms of editability visual quality and diversity.

Among these coral reefs play an important and intricate role often referred to as the rainforests of the sea due to their rich biodiversity and crucial environmental impact. Existing coral analysis due to its technical complexity requires significant manual work from coral biologists therefore hindering scalable and comprehensive studies. In this paper we introduce CoralSCOP the first foundation model designed for the automatic dense segmentation of coral reefs. CoralSCOP is developed to accurately assign labels to different coral entities addressing the challenges in the semantic analysis of coral imagery. Its main objective is to identify and delineate the irregular boundaries between various coral individuals across different granularities such as coral/non-coral growth form and genus. This task is challenging due to the semantic agnostic nature or fixed limited semantic categories of previous generic segmentation methods which fail to adequately capture the complex characteristics of coral structures. By introducing a novel parallel semantic branch CoralSCOP can produce high-quality coral masks with semantics that enable a wide range of downstream coral reef analysis tasks. We demonstrate that CoralSCOP exhibits a strong zero-shot ability to segment unseen coral images. To effectively train our foundation model we propose CoralMask a new dataset with 41297 densely labeled coral images and 330144 coral masks. We have conducted comprehensive and extensive experiments to demonstrate the advantages of CoralSCOP over existing generalist segmentation algorithms and coral reef analytical approaches."},

Since different input images for SR face different restoration difficulties adapting computational costs based on the input image referred to as adaptive inference has emerged as a promising solution to compress SR networks. Specifically adapting the quantization bit-widths has successfully reduced the inference and memory cost without sacrificing the accuracy. However despite the benefits of the resultant adaptive network existing works rely on time-intensive quantization-aware training with full access to the original training pairs to learn the appropriate bit allocation policies which limits its ubiquitous usage. To this end we introduce the first on-the-fly adaptive quantization framework that accelerates the processing time from hours to seconds. We formulate the bit allocation problem with only two bit mapping modules: one to map the input image to the image-wise bit adaptation factor and one to obtain the layer-wise adaptation factors. These bit mappings are calibrated and fine-tuned using only a small number of calibration images. We achieve competitive performance with the previous adaptive quantization methods while the processing time is accelerated by x2000. Codes are available at https://github.com/Cheeun/AdaBM."},

GRES poses challenges in modeling the complex spatial relationships of the instances in the image and identifying non-existing referents. Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) have recently shown tremendous progress in these complicated vision-language tasks. Connecting Large Language Models (LLMs) and vision models MLLMs are proficient in understanding contexts with visual inputs. Among them LISA as a representative adopts a special [SEG] token to prompt a segmentation mask decoder e.g. SAM to enable MLLMs in the RES task. However existing solutions to GRES remain unsatisfactory since current segmentation MLLMs cannot correctly handle the cases where users might reference multiple subjects in a singular prompt or provide descriptions incongruent with any image target. In this paper we propose Generalized Segmentation Vision Assistant (GSVA) to address this gap. Specifically GSVA reuses the [SEG] token to prompt the segmentation model towards supporting multiple mask references simultaneously and innovatively learns to generate a [REJ] token to reject the targets explicitly. Experiments validate GSVA's efficacy in resolving the GRES issue marking a notable enhancement and setting a new record on the GRES benchmark gRefCOCO dataset.

Steering away from such dependencies we propose a self-supervised training scheme to the Neural Dual Contouring meshing framework resulting in our method: Self-Supervised Dual Contouring (SDC). Instead of optimizing predicted mesh vertices with supervised training we use two novel self-supervised loss functions that encourage the consistency between distances to the generated mesh up to the first order. Meshes reconstructed by SDC surpass existing data-driven methods in capturing intricate details while being more robust to possible irregularities in the input. Furthermore we use the same self-supervised training objective linking inferred mesh and input SDF to regularize the training process of Deep Implicit Networks (DINs). We demonstrate that the resulting DINs produce higher-quality implicit functions ultimately leading to more accurate and detail-preserving surfaces compared to prior baselines for different input modalities. Finally we demonstrate that our self-supervised losses improve meshing performance in the single-view reconstruction task by enabling joint training of predicted SDF and resulting output mesh."},

A CUR-based second-order graph matching algorithm is used to provide a rough match and then the core of CURSOR a fiber-CUR-based tensor generation method directly calculates entries of the compatibility tensor by leveraging the initial second-order match result. This significantly decreases the time complexity and tensor density. A probability relaxation labeling (PRL)-based matching algorithm especially suitable for sparse tensors is developed.

It is particularly difficult to include shadows as they are a global effect and the required casting of secondary rays is costly. We propose a new shadow model using a Gaussian density proxy that replaces sampling with a simple analytic formula. It supports dynamic motion and is tailored for shadow computation thereby avoiding the affine projection approximation and sorting required by the closely related Gaussian splatting. Combined with a deferred neural rendering model our Gaussian shadows enable Lambertian shading and shadow casting with minimal overhead. We demonstrate improved reconstructions with better separation of albedo shading and shadows in challenging outdoor scenes with direct sun light and hard shadows. Our method is able to optimize the light direction without any input from the user. As a result novel poses have fewer shadow artifacts and relighting in novel scenes is more realistic compared to the state-of-the-art methods providing new ways to pose neural characters in novel environments increasing their applicability.

Image-based works attempt to reduce these costs by introducing sparse Transformers. However they display inadequate sparsity and adaptability when applied to event-based object detection since these approaches cannot balance the fine granularity of token-level sparsification and the efficiency of window-based Transformers leading to reduced performance and efficiency. Furthermore they lack scene-specific sparsity optimization resulting in information loss and a lower recall rate. To overcome these limitations we propose the Scene Adaptive Sparse Transformer (SAST). SAST enables window-token co-sparsification significantly enhancing fault tolerance and reducing computational overhead. Leveraging the innovative scoring and selection modules along with the Masked Sparse Window Self-Attention SAST showcases remarkable scene-aware adaptability: It focuses only on important objects and dynamically optimizes sparsity level according to scene complexity maintaining a remarkable balance between performance and computational cost.

However as a large-scale model the immense memory and computation costs hinder its practical deployment. In this paper we propose a post-training quantization (PTQ) framework for Segment Anything Model namely PTQ4SAM. First we investigate the inherent bottleneck of SAM quantization attributed to the bimodal distribution in \\cls post-Key-Linear  activations. We analyze its characteristics from both per-tensor and per-channel perspectives and propose a Bimodal Integration strategy which utilizes a mathematically equivalent sign operation to transform the bimodal distribution into a relatively easy-quantized normal distribution offline. Second SAM encompasses diverse attention mechanisms (i.e. self-attention and two-way cross-attention) resulting in substantial variations in the post-Softmax distributions. Therefore we introduce an Adaptive Granularity Quantization for Softmax through searching the optimal power-of-two base which is hardware-friendly. Extensive experimental results across various vision tasks (instance segmentation semantic segmentation and object detection) datasets and model variants show the superiority of PTQ4SAM. For example when quantizing SAM-L to 6-bit we achieve lossless accuracy for instance segmentation about 0.5% drop with theoretical 3.9xacceleration.

This lets us estimate the likelihood of test videos and detect video anomalies by thresholding the likelihood estimates. We train our video anomaly detector using a modification of denoising score matching a method that injects training data with noise to facilitate modeling its distribution. To eliminate hyperparameter selection we model the distribution of noisy video features across a range of noise levels and introduce a regularizer that tends to align the models for different levels of noise. At test time we combine anomaly indications at multiple noise scales with a Gaussian mixture model. Running our video anomaly detector induces minimal delays as inference requires merely extracting the features and forward-propagating them through a shallow neural network and a Gaussian mixture model. Our experiments on five popular video anomaly detection benchmarks demonstrate state-of-the-art performance both in the object-centric and in the frame-centric setup."},

Based on this insight we introduce a new paradigm for STR called One Token rEcognizer (OTE). Specifically we implement an image-to-vector encoder to extract the fine-grained global semantics eliminating the need for sequential features. Furthermore an elegant yet potent vector-to-sequence decoder is designed to adaptively diffuse global semantics to corresponding character locations enabling both autoregressive and non-autoregressive decoding schemes. By executing decoding within a high-level representational space our vector-to-sequence (V2S) approach avoids the alignment issues between visual tokens and character embeddings prevalent in traditional sequence-to-sequence methods. Remarkably due to introducing character-wise fine-grained information such global tokens also boost the performance of scene text retrieval tasks.

This allows us to explicitly compensate for the effect of both ego and object motion between consecutive time steps and to flexibly propagate the belief state through time. Furthermore dynamic objects can not only attend to the input camera images but also directly benefit from the inferred static scene structure via a novel dynamic-static cross-attention.

In scenarios with limited data GANs often struggle with discriminator overfitting and unstable training. Batch Normalization (BN) despite being known for enhancing generalization and training stability has rarely been used in the discriminator of Data-Efficient GANs. Our work addresses this gap by identifying a critical flaw in BN: the tendency for gradient explosion during the centering and scaling steps. To tackle this issue we present CHAIN (lipsCHitz continuity constrAIned Normalization) which replaces the conventional centering step with zero-mean regularization and integrates a Lipschitz continuity constraint in the scaling step. CHAIN further enhances GAN training by adaptively interpolating the normalized and unnormalized features effectively avoiding discriminator overfitting. Our theoretical analyses firmly establishes CHAIN's effectiveness in reducing gradients in latent features and weights improving stability and generalization in GAN training.

Previous methods usually follow an end-to-end pipeline directly predicting the BEV segmentation map from monocular RGB inputs. However the challenge arises when the RGB inputs and BEV targets from distinct perspectives making the direct point-to-point predicting hard to optimize. In this paper we decompose the original BEV segmentation task into two stages namely BEV map reconstruction and RGB-BEV feature alignment. In the first stage we train a BEV autoencoder to reconstruct the BEV segmentation maps given corrupted noisy latent representation which urges the decoder to learn fundamental knowledge of typical BEV patterns. The second stage involves mapping RGB input images into the BEV latent space of the first stage directly optimizing the correlations between the two views at the feature level. Our approach simplifies the complexity of combining perception and generation into distinct steps equipping the model to handle intricate and challenging scenes effectively.

Our key observation is that directly modeling the joint distribution of multiple instances imposes high learning complexity due to its combinatorial nature. Thus we propose to decompose the modeling of joint distribution into the modeling of factored unconditional and conditional single instance distribution. In particular we introduce a diffusion model that learns the single-hand distribution unconditional and conditional to another hand via conditioning dropout. For sampling we combine anti-penetration and classifier-free guidance to enable plausible generation.

Cardiopulmonary Resuscitation (CPR) is an essential skill in emergency treatment. Currently the assessment of CPR skills mainly depends on dummies and trainers leading to high training costs and low efficiency. For the first time this paper constructs a vision-based system to complete error action recognition and skill assessment in CPR. Specifically we define 13 types of single-error actions and 74 types of composite error actions during external cardiac compression and then develop a video dataset named CPR-Coach. By taking the CPR-Coach as a benchmark this paper investigates and compares the performance of existing action recognition models based on different data modalities. To solve the unavoidable \"Single-class Training & Multi-class Testing\" problem we propose a human-cognition-inspired framework named ImagineNet to improve the model's multi-error recognition performance under restricted supervision. Extensive comparison and actual deployment experiments verify the effectiveness of the framework. We hope this work could bring new inspiration to the computer vision and medical skills training communities simultaneously.

While tracking performance has significantly improved the target loss issue occurs frequently due to tracking failures complete occlusion or out-of-view situations. However considerably less attention is paid to the self-recovery issue of tracking methods which is crucial for practical applications. To this end we propose a recoverable tracking framework \\ourmethod that uses a tree-structured memory to dynamically associate a tracker and a detector to enable self-recovery ability. Specifically we propose a Positive-Negative Tree-structured memory to chronologically store and maintain positive and negative target samples. Upon the PN tree memory we develop corresponding walking rules for determining the state of the target and define a set of control flows to unite the tracker and the detector in different tracking scenarios. Our core idea is to use the support samples of positive and negative target categories to establish a relative distance-based criterion for a reliable assessment of target loss. The favorable performance in comparison against the state-of-the-art methods on numerous challenging benchmarks demonstrates the effectiveness of the proposed algorithm.

Snoek", "abstract": "Image-language models with prompt learning have shown remarkable advances in numerous downstream vision tasks. Nevertheless conventional prompt learning methods overfit the training distribution and lose the generalization ability on the test distributions. To improve the generalization across various distribution shifts we propose any-shift prompting: a general probabilistic inference framework that considers the relationship between training and test distributions during prompt learning. We explicitly connect training and test distributions in the latent space by constructing training and test prompts in a hierarchical architecture. Within this framework the test prompt exploits the distribution relationships to guide the generalization of the CLIP image-language model from training to any test distribution. To effectively encode the distribution information and their relationships we further introduce a transformer inference network with a pseudo-shift training mechanism. The network generates the tailored test prompt with both training and test information in a feedforward pass avoiding extra training costs at test time. Extensive experiments on twenty-three datasets demonstrate the effectiveness of any-shift prompting on the generalization over various distribution shifts."},

In this paper we propose a modality-agnostic structural representation learning method which leverages Deep Neighbourhood Self-similarity (DNS) and anatomy-aware contrastive learning to learn discriminative and contrast-invariance deep structural image representations (DSIR) without the need for anatomical delineations or pre-aligned training images.

This is where point-based image editing becomes essential. An excellent image editing method needs to meet the following criteria: user-friendly interaction high performance and good generalization capability. Due to the limitations of StyleGAN DragGAN exhibits limited robustness across diverse scenarios while DragDiffusion lacks user-friendliness due to the necessity of LoRA fine-tuning and masks. In this paper we introduce a novel interactive point-based image editing framework called EasyDrag that leverages pretrained diffusion models to achieve high-quality editing outcomes and user-friendship.

These cameras implicitly capture movement and depth information in events making them appealing sensors for Camera Pose Relocalization (CPR) tasks. Nevertheless existing CPR networks based on events neglect the pivotal fine-grained temporal information in events resulting in unsatisfactory performance. Moreover the energy-efficient features are further compromised by the use of excessively complex models hindering efficient deployment on edge devices. In this paper we introduce PEPNet a simple and effective point-based network designed to regress six degrees of freedom (6-DOFs) event camera poses. We rethink the relationship between the event camera and CPR tasks leveraging the raw Point Cloud directly as network input to harness the high-temporal resolution and inherent sparsity of events. PEPNet is adept at abstracting the spatial and implicit temporal features through hierarchical structure and explicit temporal features by Attentive Bi-directional Long Short-Term Memory (A-Bi-LSTM). By employing a carefully crafted lightweight design PEPNet delivers state-of-the-art (SOTA) performance on both indoor and outdoor datasets with meager computational resources. Specifically PEPNet attains a significant 38% and 33% performance improvement on the random split IJRR and M3ED datasets respectively.

{"title": "Semantic-Aware Multi-Label Adversarial Attacks", "authors": "Hassan Mahmood, Ehsan Elhamifar", "abstract": "Despite its importance generating attacks for multi label learning (MLL) models has received much less attention compared to multi-class recognition. Attacking an MLL model by optimizing a loss on the target set of labels has often the undesired consequence of changing the predictions for other labels. On the other hand adding a loss on the remaining labels to keep them fixed leads to highly negatively correlated gradient directions reducing the attack effectiveness. In this paper we develop a framework for crafting effective and semantic aware adversarial attacks for MLL. First to obtain an attack that leads to semantically consistent predictions across all labels we find a minimal superset of the target labels referred to as consistent target set. To do so we develop an efficient search algorithm over a knowledge graph which encodes label dependencies. Next we propose an optimization that searches for an attack that modifies the predictions of labels in the consistent target set while ensuring other labels will not get affected. This leads to an efficient algorithm that projects the gradient of the consistent target set loss onto the orthogonal direction of the gradient of the loss on other labels. Our framework can generate attacks on different target set sizes and for MLL with thousands of labels (as in OpenImages). Finally by extensive experiments on three datasets and several MLL models we show that our method generates both successful and semantically consistent attacks."},

The way individuals position themselves in relation to others also known as proxemics conveys social cues and affects the dynamics of social interaction. Reconstructing such interaction from images presents challenges because of mutual occlusion and the limited availability of large training datasets. To address this we present a novel approach that learns a prior over the 3D proxemics two people in close social interaction and demonstrate its use for single-view 3D reconstruction. We start by creating 3D training data of interacting people using image datasets with contact annotations. We then model the proxemics using a novel denoising diffusion model called BUDDI that learns the joint distribution over the poses of two people in close social interaction. Sampling from our generative proxemics model produces realistic 3D human interactions which we validate through a perceptual study. We use BUDDI in reconstructing two people in close proximity from an image without any contact annotation via an optimization approach that uses the diffusion model as a prior. Our approach recovers accurate 3D social interactions from noisy initial estimates outperforming state-of-the-art methods. Our code data and model are available at: muelea.github.io/buddi."},

Moreover point clouds and trajectory features are combined solely based on concatenation which may neglect effective interactions between them. In this paper we propose a point-trajectory transformer with long short-term memory for efficient temporal 3D object detection. To this end we only utilize point clouds of current-frame objects and their historical trajectories as input to minimize the memory bank storage requirement. Furthermore we introduce modules to encode trajectory features focusing on long short-term and future-aware perspectives and then effectively aggregate them with point cloud features.

A promising technique is to leverage the knowledge of large-scale pre-trained vision-language models for more guided adaptation. Despite some endeavors current methods often learn textual prompts to embed domain semantics for source and target domains separately and perform classification within each domain limiting cross-domain knowledge transfer. Moreover prompting only the language branch lacks flexibility to adapt both modalities dynamically. To bridge this gap we propose Domain-Agnostic Mutual Prompting (DAMP) to exploit domain-invariant semantics by mutually aligning visual and textual embeddings. Specifically the image contextual information is utilized to prompt the language branch in a domain-agnostic and instance-conditioned way. Meanwhile visual prompts are imposed based on the domain-agnostic textual prompt to elicit domain-invariant visual embeddings. These two branches of prompts are learned mutually with a cross-attention module and regularized with a semantic-consistency loss and an instance-discrimination contrastive loss. Experiments on three UDA benchmarks demonstrate the superiority of DAMP over state-of-the-art approaches."},

However neural SDFs are difficult to fit to raw point clouds such as those sampled from the surface of a shape by a scanner. A major issue occurs when the shape's geometry is very different from the structural biases implicit in the network's initialization. In this case we observe that the standard loss formulation does not guide the network towards the correct SDF values. We circumvent this problem by introducing guiding points and use them to steer the optimization towards the true shape via small incremental changes for which the loss formulation has a good descent direction. We show that this point-guided homotopy-based optimization scheme facilitates a deformation from an easy problem to the difficult reconstruction problem. We also propose a metric to quantify the difference in surface geometry between a target shape and an initial surface which helps indicate whether the standard loss formulation is guiding towards the target shape. Our method outperforms previous state-of-the-art approaches with large improvements on shapes identified by this metric as particularly challenging."},

However this strategy meets the obstacles of efficiency overhead and the small crowded objects that cannot be localized and distinguished. To address these issues our framework termed PseCo follows three steps: point segment and count. Specifically we first propose a class-agnostic object localization to provide accurate but least point prompts for SAM which consequently not only reduces computation costs but also avoids missing small objects. Furthermore we propose a generalized object classification that leverages CLIP image/text embeddings as the classifier following a hierarchical knowledge distillation to obtain discriminative classifications among hierarchical mask proposals. Extensive experimental results on FSC-147 COCO and LVIS demonstrate that PseCo achieves state-of-the-art performance in both few-shot/zero-shot object counting/detection."},

Specifically we devise a deep neural network that learns to represent the geometry and appearance distribution of clothed human bodies. Training such a model is challenging as datasets of textured 3D meshes for humans are limited in size and accessibility. Our key observation is that there exist medium-sized 3D scan datasets like CAPE as well as large-scale 2D image datasets of clothed humans and multiple appearances can be mapped to a single geometry. To effectively learn from the two data modalities we propose an unpaired learning procedure for pose-dependent clothed and textured human meshes. Specifically we learn a pose-dependent geometry space from 3D scan data. We represent this as per vertex displacements w.r.t. the SMPL model. Next we train a geometry conditioned texture generator in an unsupervised way using the 2D image data. We use intermediate activations of the learned geometry model to condition our texture generator. To alleviate entanglement between pose and clothing type and pose and clothing appearance we condition both the texture and geometry generators with attribute labels such as clothing types for the geometry and clothing colors for the texture generator. We automatically generated these conditioning labels for the 2D images based on the visual question-answering model BLIP and CLIP.

To address this problem in this paper we propose to solve the Multimodal Video Test-Time Adaptation task (MVTTA). Existing image-based TTA methods cannot be directly applied to this task because video have domain shift in multimodal and temporal which brings difficulties to adaptation. To address the above challenges we propose a Modality-Collaborative Test-Time Adaptation (MC-TTA) Network.

Current defense strategies usually train DNNs for a specific adversarial attack method and can achieve good robustness in defense against this type of adversarial attack. Nevertheless when subjected to evaluations involving unfamiliar attack modalities empirical evidence reveals a pronounced deterioration in the robustness of DNNs. Meanwhile there is a trade-off between the classification accuracy of clean examples and adversarial examples. Most defense methods often sacrifice the accuracy of clean examples in order to improve the adversarial robustness of DNNs. To alleviate these problems and enhance the overall robust generalization of DNNs we propose the Test-Time Pixel-Level Adversarial Purification (TPAP) method. This approach is based on the robust overfitting characteristic of DNNs to the fast gradient sign method (FGSM) on training and test datasets. It utilizes FGSM for adversarial purification to process images for purifying unknown adversarial perturbations from pixels at testing time in a \"counter changes with changelessness\" manner thereby enhancing the defense capability of DNNs against various unknown adversarial attacks.

Specifically we propose a feed-forward framework VideoBooth with two dedicated designs: 1) We propose to embed image prompts in a coarse-to-fine manner. Coarse visual embeddings from image encoder provide high-level encodings of image prompts while fine visual embeddings from the proposed attention injection module provide multi-scale and detailed encoding of image prompts. These two complementary embeddings can faithfully capture the desired appearance. 2) In the attention injection module at fine level multi-scale image prompts are fed into different cross-frame attention layers as additional keys and values. This extra spatial information refines the details in the first frame and then it is propagated to the remaining frames which maintains temporal consistency.

Existing work mainly focuses on designing various learning forms of prompts neglecting the potential of prompts as effective distillers for learning from larger teacher models. In this paper we introduce an unsupervised domain prompt distillation framework which aims to transfer the knowledge of a larger teacher model to a lightweight target model through prompt-driven imitation using unlabeled domain images. Specifically our framework consists of two distinct stages. In the initial stage we pre-train a large CLIP teacher model using domain (few-shot) labels. After pre-training we leverage the unique decoupled-modality characteristics of CLIP by pre-computing and storing the text features as class vectors only once through the teacher text encoder. In the subsequent stage the stored class vectors are shared across teacher and student image encoders for calculating the predicted logits. Further we align the logits of both the teacher and student models via KL divergence encouraging the student image encoder to generate similar probability distributions to the teacher through the learnable prompts. The proposed prompt distillation process eliminates the reliance on labeled data enabling the algorithm to leverage a vast amount of unlabeled images within the domain. Finally the well-trained student image encoders and pre-stored text features (class vectors) are utilized for inference. To our best knowledge we are the first to (1) perform unsupervised domain-specific prompt-driven knowledge distillation for CLIP and (2) establish a practical pre-storing mechanism of text features as shared class vectors between teacher and student.

Common practices involve constructing variance-based cost volumes for geometry reconstruction and encoding 3D descriptors for decoding novel views. However existing methods show limited generalization ability in challenging conditions due to inaccurate geometry sub-optimal descriptors and decoding strategies. We address these issues point by point. First we find the variance-based cost volume exhibits failure patterns as the features of pixels corresponding to the same point can be inconsistent across different views due to occlusions or reflections. We introduce an Adaptive Cost Aggregation (ACA) approach to amplify the contribution of consistent pixel pairs and suppress inconsistent ones. Unlike previous methods that solely fuse 2D features into descriptors our approach introduces a Spatial-View Aggregator (SVA) to incorporate 3D context into descriptors through spatial and inter-view interaction. When decoding the descriptors we observe the two existing decoding strategies excel in different areas which are complementary. A Consistency-Aware Fusion (CAF) strategy is proposed to leverage the advantages of both.

Based on the assumption a novel two-stage self-supervised framework leveraging the diffusion model for IFDL task i.e. DiffForensics is proposed in this paper. The DiffForensics begins with self-supervised denoising diffusion paradigm equipped with the module of encoder-decoder structure by freezing the pre-trained encoder (e.g. in ADE-20K) to inherit macroscopic features for general image characteristics while encouraging the decoder to learn microscopic feature representation of images enforcing the whole model to focus the mesoscopic representations. The pre-trained model as a prior is then further fine-tuned for IFDL task with the customized Edge Cue Enhancement Module (ECEM) which progressively highlights the boundary features within the manipulated regions thereby refining tampered area localization with better precision. Extensive experiments on several public challenging datasets demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed method compared with other state-of-the-art methods.

Unlike previous dense-correspondence methods we estimate the correspondence surface by employing point-to-surface matching and iteratively constricting the surface until it becomes a correspondence point while gradually removing outliers. Extensive experiments on public benchmarks LM-O YCB-V and T-Less demonstrate that our method surpasses all refinement-free methods and is even on par with expensive refinement-based approaches. Crucially our approach is computationally efficient and enables real-time critical applications with high accuracy requirements."},

However prior LSS methods are conventionally investigated and evaluated on datasets within the same domain in clear weather. The robustness of LSS models in unseen scenes and all weather conditions is crucial for ensuring safety and reliability in real applications. To this end we propose UniMix a universal method that enhances the adaptability and generalizability of LSS models. UniMix first leverages physically valid adverse weather simulation to construct a Bridge Domain which serves to bridge the domain gap between the clear weather scenes and the adverse weather scenes. Then a Universal Mixing operator is defined regarding spatial intensity and semantic distributions to create the intermediate domain with mixed samples from given domains. Integrating the proposed two techniques into a teacher-student framework UniMix efficiently mitigates the domain gap and enables LSS models to learn weather-robust and domain-invariant representations. We devote UniMix to two main setups: 1) unsupervised domain adaption adapting the model from the clear weather source domain to the adverse weather target domain; 2) domain generalization learning a model that generalizes well to unseen scenes in adverse weather. Extensive experiments validate the effectiveness of UniMix across different tasks and datasets all achieving superior performance over state-of-the-art methods. The code will be released."},
{"title": "Visual Delta Generator with Large Multi-modal Models for Semi-supervised Composed Image Retrieval", "authors": "Young Kyun Jang, Donghyun Kim, Zihang Meng, Dat Huynh, Ser-Nam Lim", "abstract": "Composed Image Retrieval (CIR) is a task that retrieves images similar to a query based on a provided textual modification. Current techniques rely on supervised learning for CIR models using labeled triplets of the <reference image text target image>. These specific triplets are not as commonly available as simple image-text pairs limiting the widespread use of CIR and its scalability. On the other hand zero-shot CIR can be relatively easily trained with image-caption pairs without considering the image-to-image relation but this approach tends to yield lower accuracy. We propose a new semi-supervised CIR approach where we search for a reference and its related target images in auxiliary data and learn our large language model-based Visual Delta Generator (VDG) to generate text describing the visual difference (i.e. visual delta) between the two. VDG equipped with fluent language knowledge and being model agnostic can generate pseudo triplets to boost the performance of CIR models. Our approach significantly improves the existing supervised learning approaches and achieves state-of-the-art results on the CIR benchmarks."},

Most existing dataset pruning methods rely on snapshot-based criteria to identify representative samples often resulting in poor generalization across various pruning and cross-architecture scenarios. Recent studies have addressed this issue by expanding the scope of training dynamics considered including factors such as forgetting event and probability change typically using an averaging approach. However these works struggle to integrate a broader range of training dynamics without overlooking well-generalized samples which may not be sufficiently highlighted in an averaging manner. In this study we propose a novel dataset pruning method termed as Temporal Dual-Depth Scoring (TDDS) to tackle this problem. TDDS utilizes a dual-depth strategy to achieve a balance between incorporating extensive training dynamics and identifying representative samples for dataset pruning. In the first depth we estimate the series of each sample's individual contributions spanning the training progress ensuring comprehensive integration of training dynamics. In the second depth we focus on the variability of the sample-wise contributions identified in the first depth to highlight well-generalized samples. Extensive experiments conducted on CIFAR and ImageNet datasets verify the superiority of TDDS over previous SOTA methods. Specifically on CIFAR-100 our method achieves 54.51% accuracy with only 10% training data surpassing baselines methods by more than 12.69%.

{"title": "Strong Transferable Adversarial Attacks via Ensembled Asymptotically Normal Distribution Learning", "authors": "Zhengwei Fang, Rui Wang, Tao Huang, Liping Jing", "abstract": "Strong adversarial examples are crucial for evaluating and enhancing the robustness of deep neural networks. However the performance of popular attacks is usually sensitive for instance to minor image transformations stemming from limited information -- typically only one input example a handful of white-box source models and undefined defense strategies. Hence the crafted adversarial examples are prone to overfit the source model which hampers their transferability to unknown architectures. In this paper we propose an approach named Multiple Asymptotically Normal Distribution Attacks (MultiANDA) which explicitly characterize adversarial perturbations from a learned distribution. Specifically we approximate the posterior distribution over the perturbations by taking advantage of the asymptotic normality property of stochastic gradient ascent (SGA) then employ the deep ensemble strategy as an effective proxy for Bayesian marginalization in this process aiming to estimate a mixture of Gaussians that facilitates a more thorough exploration of the potential optimization space. The approximated posterior essentially describes the stationary distribution of SGA iterations which captures the geometric information around the local optimum. Thus MultiANDA allows drawing an unlimited number of adversarial perturbations for each input and reliably maintains the transferability. Our proposed method outperforms ten state-of-the-art black-box attacks on deep learning models with or without defenses through extensive experiments on seven normally trained and seven defense models."},

This approach leverages human-centric videos as an intermediary modality effectively bridging the divide between text and motion. By employing contrastive learning we construct a cohesive embedding space across the three modalities. Furthermore we incorporate a motion reconstruction branch ensuring that the resulting motion remains closely aligned with its original trajectory. Experimental evaluations on the HumanML3D and KIT-ML datasets demonstrate the superiority of our method in comparison to existing approaches. Furthermore we introduce a novel task termed video-to-motion retrieval designed to facilitate the seamlessxt eraction of corresponding 3D motions from an RGB video. Supplementary experiments demonstrate that our model is extensible to real-world human-centric videos offering a valuable complement to the pose estimation task."},

We present Seg2Reg to render 1D layout depth regression from the 2D segmentation map in a differentiable and occlusion-aware way marrying the merits of both sides. Specifically our model predicts floor-plan density for the input equirectangular 360 image. Formulating the 2D layout representation as a density field enables us to employ 'flattened' volume rendering to form 1D layout depth regression. In addition we propose a novel 3D warping augmentation on layout to improve generalization.

Current research has primarily focused on the development of tracking algorithms and enhancement of post-processing techniques. Yet there has been a lack of thorough examination concerning the nature of tracking data it self. In this study we pioneer an exploration into the distribution patterns of tracking data and identify a pronounced long-tail distribution issue within existing MOT datasets. We note a significant imbalance in the distribution of trajectory lengths across different pedestrians a phenomenon we refer to as \"pedestrians trajectory long-tail distribution\". Addressing this challenge we introduce a bespoke strategy designed to mitigate the effects of this skewed distribution. Specifically we propose two data augmentation strategies including Stationary Camera View Data Augmentation (SVA) and Dynamic Camera View Data Augmentation (DVA) designed for viewpoint states and the Group Softmax (GS) module for Re-ID. SVA is to backtrack and predict the pedestrian trajectory of tail classes and DVA is to use diffusion model to change the background of the scene. GS divides the pedestrians into unrelated groups and performs softmax operation on each group individually. Our proposed strategies can be integrated into numerous existing tracking systems and extensive experimentation validates the efficacy of our method in reducing the influence of long-tail distribution on multi-object tracking performance.

However the impact of the NeF hyperparameters on their quality as downstream representation is scarcely understood and remains largely unexplored. This is in part caused by the large amount of time required to fit datasets of neural fields.In this work we propose a JAX-based library that leverages parallelization to enable fast optimization of large-scale NeF datasets resulting in a significant speed-up. With this library we perform a comprehensive study that investigates the effects of different hyperparameters on fitting NeFs for downstream tasks. In particular we explore the use of a shared initialization the effects of overtraining and the expressiveness of the network architectures used. Our study provides valuable insights on how to train NeFs and offers guidance for optimizing their effectiveness in downstream applications.

Yet these tools in the wrong hands can fabricate misleading or harmful content endangering individuals. To address this problem existing poisoning-based approaches perturb user images in an imperceptible way to render them \"unlearnable\" from malicious uses. We identify two limitations of these defending approaches: i) sub-optimal due to the hand-crafted heuristics for solving the intractable bilevel optimization and ii) lack of robustness against simple data transformations like Gaussian filtering. To solve these challenges we propose MetaCloak which solves the bi-level poisoning problem with a meta-learning framework with an additional transformation sampling process to craft transferable and robust perturbation. Specifically we employ a pool of surrogate diffusion models to craft transferable and model-agnostic perturbation. Furthermore by incorporating an additional transformation process we design a simple denoising-error maximization loss that is sufficient for causing transformation-robust semantic distortion and degradation in a personalized generation. Extensive experiments on the VGGFace2 and CelebA-HQ datasets show that MetaCloak outperforms existing approaches.

It incorporates a novel multi-condition adapter that adaptively controls the input weights from different modalities including depth maps RGB images and text captions to effectively illuminate dark scenes while maintaining context consistency.

Recent approaches address this issue by pre-training according to pseudo-labels which align object regions with HOI triplets parsed from image captions. However pseudo-labeling is tricky and noisy making HOI pre-training a complex process. Therefore we propose an efficient disentangled pre-training method for HOI detection (DP-HOI) to address this problem. First DP-HOI utilizes object detection and action recognition datasets to pre-train the detection and interaction decoder layers respectively. Then we arrange these decoder layers so that the pre-training architecture is consistent with the downstream HOI detection task. This facilitates efficient knowledge transfer. Specifically the detection decoder identifies reliable human instances in each action recognition dataset image generates one corresponding query and feeds it into the interaction decoder for verb classification. Next we combine the human instance verb predictions in the same image and impose image-level supervision. The DP-HOI structure can be easily adapted to the HOI detection task enabling effective model parameter initialization. Therefore it significantly enhances the performance of existing HOI detection models on a broad range of rare categories.

Existing approaches strive to overcome this limitation by reducing less meaningful image regions. However current leading methods rely on supervisory signals. They may compel models to preserve content that aligns with labeled categories and discard content belonging to unlabeled categories. This categorical inductive bias makes these methods less effective in real-world scenarios. To address this issue we propose a self-supervised framework for image redundancy reduction called Learning to Rank Patches (LTRP). We observe that image reconstruction of masked image modeling models is sensitive to the removal of visible patches when the masking ratio is high (e.g. 90%). Building upon it we implement LTRP via two steps: inferring the semantic density score of each patch by quantifying variation between reconstructions with and without this patch and learning to rank the patches with the pseudo score. The entire process is self-supervised thus getting out of the dilemma of categorical inductive bias. We design extensive experiments on different datasets and tasks. The results demonstrate that LTRP outperforms both supervised and other self-supervised methods due to the fair assessment of image content."},

Gathering ample data for production scenarios often demands significant time and resources. Among various strategies data augmentation circumvents exhaustive data collection by generating new data points from existing ones.

This paper explores the potential of synthetic data by leveraging large pre-trained models for data augmentation especially when confronted with distribution shifts. Although recent advancements in generative models have enabled several prior works in cross-distribution data generation they require model fine-tuning and a complex setup. To bypass these shortcomings we introduce Domain Gap Embeddings (DoGE) a plug-and-play semantic data augmentation framework in a cross-distribution few-shot setting. Our method extracts disparities between source and desired data distributions in a latent form and subsequently steers a generative process to supplement the training set with endless diverse synthetic samples. Our evaluations conducted on a subpopulation shift and three domain adaptation scenarios under a few-shot paradigm reveal that our versatile method improves performance across tasks without needing hands-on intervention or intricate fine-tuning. DoGE paves the way to effortlessly generate realistic controllable synthetic datasets following the test distributions bolstering real-world efficacy for downstream task models."},

This paper introduces a new benchmark dataset 360Loc composed of 360^\\circ images with ground truth poses for visual localization. We present a practical implementation of 360^\\circ mapping combining 360^\\circ images with lidar data to generate the ground truth 6DoF poses. 360Loc is the first dataset and benchmark that explores the challenge of cross-device visual positioning involving 360^\\circ reference frames and query frames from pinhole ultra-wide FoV fisheye and 360^\\circ cameras.

Recently Gaussian splatting has emerged as a robust technique to represent static scenes and enable high-quality and real-time novel view synthesis. Building upon this technique we propose a new representation that explicitly decomposes the motion and appearance of dynamic scenes into sparse control points and dense Gaussians respectively. Our key idea is to use sparse control points significantly fewer in number than the Gaussians to learn compact 6 DoF transformation bases which can be locally interpolated through learned interpolation weights to yield the motion field of 3D Gaussians. We employ a deformation MLP to predict time-varying 6 DoF transformations for each control point which reduces learning complexities enhances learning abilities and facilitates obtaining temporal and spatial coherent motion patterns. Then we jointly learn the 3D Gaussians the canonical space locations of control points and the deformation MLP to reconstruct the appearance geometry and dynamics of 3D scenes. During learning the location and number of control points are adaptively adjusted to accommodate varying motion complexities in different regions and an ARAP loss following the principle of as rigid as possible is developed to enforce spatial continuity and local rigidity of learned motions. Finally thanks to the explicit sparse motion representation and its decomposition from appearance our method can enable user-controlled motion editing while retaining high-fidelity appearances. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our approach outperforms existing approaches on novel view synthesis with a high rendering speed and enables novel appearance-preserved motion editing applications."},

To address this issue we propose a novel Visual-Augmented Dynamic Semantic prototype method (termed VADS) to boost the generator to learn accurate semantic-visual mapping by fully exploiting the visual-augmented knowledge into semantic conditions. In detail VADS consists of two modules: (1) Visual-aware Domain Knowledge Learning module (VDKL) learns the local bias and global prior of the visual features (referred to as domain visual knowledge) which replace pure Gaussian noise to provide richer prior noise information; (2) Vision-Oriented Semantic Updation module (VOSU) updates the semantic prototype according to the visual representations of the samples. Ultimately we concatenate their output as a dynamic semantic prototype which serves as the condition of the generator.

Most of the existing methods generate a holistic 3D model from a plain text input. This can be problematic when the text describes a complex scene with multiple objects because the vectorized text embeddings are inherently unable to capture a complex description with multiple entities and relationships. Holistic 3D modeling of the entire scene further prevents accurate grounding of text entities and concepts. To address this limitation we propose GraphDreamer a novel framework to generate compositional 3D scenes from scene graphs where objects are represented as nodes and their interactions as edges. By exploiting node and edge information in scene graphs our method makes better use of the pretrained text-to-image diffusion model and is able to fully disentangle different objects without image-level supervision. To facilitate modeling of object-wise relationships we use signed distance fields as representation and impose a constraint to avoid inter-penetration of objects.

Previous token pruning works motivate their methods from the view of computation redundancy but still need to load the full network and require same memory costs. This paper introduces a novel strategy that simplifies vision transformers and reduces computational load through the selective removal of non-essential attention layers guided by entropy considerations. We identify that regarding the attention layer in bottom blocks their subsequent MLP layers i.e. two feed-forward layers can elicit the same entropy quantity. Meanwhile the accompanied MLPs are under-exploited since they exhibit smaller feature entropy compared to those MLPs in the top blocks. Therefore we propose to integrate the uninformative attention layers into their subsequent counterparts by degenerating them into identical mapping yielding only MLP in certain transformer blocks.

It features 1) multi-modality with Polarimetric RGB and Depth (RGBD+P) 2) encompasses 194 diverse objects across 10 household categories including two photometrically challenging ones and 3) provides high-quality pose annotations with an error range of only 1.35 mm to 1.74 mm. The dataset also includes 4) 41 large-scale scenes with comprehensive viewpoint and occlusion coverage 5) a checkerboard-free environment and 6. dense 6D parallel-jaw robotic grasp annotations. Additionally we present benchmark results for leading category-level pose estimation networks."},

Most existing approaches adopt point discrimination as the pretext task which assigns matched points in two distinct views as positive pairs and unmatched points as negative pairs. However this approach often results in semantically identical points having dissimilar representations leading to a high number of false negatives and introducing a semantic conflict problem. To address this issue we propose GroupContrast a novel approach that combines segment grouping and semantic-aware contrastive learning. Segment grouping partitions points into semantically meaningful regions which enhances semantic coherence and provides semantic guidance for the subsequent contrastive representation learning. Semantic-aware contrastive learning augments the semantic information extracted from segment grouping and helps to alleviate the issue of semantic conflict. We conducted extensive experiments on multiple 3D scene understanding tasks. The results demonstrate that GroupContrast learns semantically meaningful representations and achieves promising transfer learning performance."},

This high image-generation capability has stimulated the creation of many downstream applications in various areas. However we find that this technology is actually a double-edged sword: We identify a new type of attack called the Natural Denoising Diffusion (NDD) attack based on the finding that state-of-the-art deep neural network (DNN) models still hold their prediction even if we intentionally remove their robust features which are essential to the human visual system (HVS) through text prompts. The NDD attack shows a significantly high capability to generate low-cost model-agnostic and transferable adversarial attacks by exploiting the natural attack capability in diffusion models. To systematically evaluate the risk of the NDD attack we perform a large-scale empirical study with our newly created dataset the Natural Denoising Diffusion Attack (NDDA) dataset. We evaluate the natural attack capability by answering 6 research questions. Through a user study we find that it can achieve an 88% detection rate while being stealthy to 93% of human subjects; we also find that the non-robust features embedded by diffusion models contribute to the natural attack capability. To confirm the model-agnostic and transferable attack capability we perform the NDD attack against the Tesla Model 3 and find that 73% of the physically printed attacks can be detected as stop signs. Our hope is that the study and dataset can help our community be aware of the risks in diffusion models and facilitate further research toward robust DNN models."},

We apply our annotation scheme to two large-scale video datasets with text descriptions and annotate over 19M points across 133K objects in 32K videos. Based on our annotations we propose a new Point-VOS benchmark and a corresponding point-based training mechanism which we use to establish strong baseline results. We show that existing VOS methods can easily be adapted to leverage our point annotations during training and can achieve results close to the fully-supervised performance when trained on pseudo-masks generated from these points.

However the compositional reasoning abilities of existing VLMs remains subpar. The root of this limitation lies in the inadequate alignment between the images and captions in the pretraining datasets. Additionally the current contrastive learning objective fails to focus on fine-grained grounding components like relations actions and attributes resulting in \"bag-of-words\" representations. We introduce a simple and effective method to improve compositional reasoning in VLMs. Our method better leverages available datasets by refining and expanding the standard image-text contrastive learning framework. Our approach does not require specific annotations and does not incur extra parameters. When integrated with CLIP our technique yields notable improvement over state-of-the-art baselines across five vision-language compositional benchmarks."},

However detecting recaptured document images subjected to distortions from online social networks (OSNs) is challenging since the common forensics cues such as moir ?e pattern are weakened during transmission. In this work we first devise a pixel-level distortion model of the screen-recaptured document image to identify the robust features of color artifacts. Then we extract a chromaticity map from the recaptured image to highlight the presence of color artifacts even under low-quality samples. Based on the prior understanding we design a chromaticity map adapter (CMA) to efficiently extract the chromaticity map and feed it into the transformer backbone as multi-modal prompt tokens. To evaluate the performance of the proposed method we collect a recaptured office document image dataset with over 10K diverse samples. Experimental results demonstrate that the proposed CMA method outperforms a SOTA approach (with RGB modality only) reducing the average EER from 26.82% to 16.78%. Robustness evaluation shows that our method achieves 0.8688 and 0.7554 AUCs under samples with JPEG compression (QF=70) and resolution as low as 534x503 pixels."},

Although vision-language models (VLMs) integrate LLM modules (1) aligned with static image features and (2) may possess prior knowledge of world dynamics (as demonstrated in the text world) they have not been trained in an embodied visual world and thus cannot align with its dynamics. On the other hand training an embodied agent in a noisy visual world without expert guidance is often challenging and inefficient. In this paper we train a VLM agent living in a visual world using an LLM agent excelling in a parallel text world. Specifically we distill LLM's reflection outcomes (improved actions by analyzing mistakes) in a text world's tasks to finetune the VLM on the same tasks of the visual world resulting in an Embodied Multi-Modal Agent (EMMA) quickly adapting to the visual world dynamics. Such cross-modality imitation learning between the two parallel worlds is achieved by a novel DAgger-DPO algorithm enabling EMMA to generalize to a broad scope of new tasks without any further guidance from the LLM expert.

Kim", "abstract": "Pre-trained vision-language models have shown impressive success on various computer vision tasks with their zero-shot generalizability. Recently prompt learning approaches have been explored to efficiently and effectively adapt the vision-language models to a variety of downstream tasks. However most existing prompt learning methods suffer from task overfitting since the general knowledge of the pre-trained vision language models is forgotten while the prompts are finetuned on a small data set from a specific target task. To address this issue we propose a Prompt Meta-Regularization (ProMetaR) to improve the generalizability of prompt learning for vision-language models. Specifically ProMetaR meta-learns both the regularizer and the soft prompts to harness the task-specific knowledge from the downstream tasks and task-agnostic general knowledge from the vision-language models. Further ProMetaR augments the task to generate multiple virtual tasks to alleviate the meta-overfitting. In addition we provide the analysis to comprehend how ProMetaR improves the generalizability of prompt tuning in the perspective of the gradient alignment. Our extensive experiments demonstrate that our ProMetaR improves the generalizability of conventional prompt learning methods under base-to-base/base-to-new and domain generalization settings.

Venkatesh Babu", "abstract": "Vision-Language Models (VLMs) such as CLIP are trained on large amounts of image-text pairs resulting in remarkable generalization across several data distributions. However in several cases their expensive training and data collection/curation costs do not justify the end application. This motivates a vendor-client paradigm where a vendor trains a large-scale VLM and grants only input-output access to clients on a pay-per-query basis in a black-box setting. The client aims to minimize inference cost by distilling the VLM to a student model using the limited available task-specific data and further deploying this student model in the downstream application. While naive distillation largely improves the In-Domain (ID) accuracy of the student it fails to transfer the superior out-of-distribution (OOD) generalization of the VLM teacher using the limited available labeled images. To mitigate this we propose Vision-Language to Vision - Align Distill Predict (VL2V-ADiP) which first aligns the vision and language modalities of the teacher model with the vision modality of a pre-trained student model and further distills the aligned VLM representations to the student. This maximally retains the pre-trained features of the student while also incorporating the rich representations of the VLM image encoder and the superior generalization of the text embeddings. The proposed approach achieves state-of-the-art results on the standard Domain Generalization benchmarks in a black-box teacher setting as well as a white-box setting where the weights of the VLM are accessible."},

Existing methods typically learn noisy class posteriors by training a classification model with noisy labels. However when labels are incorrect these models may be misled to overemphasize the feature parts that do not reflect the instance characteristics resulting in significant errors in estimating noisy class posteriors. To address this issue this paper proposes to augment the supervised information with part-level labels encouraging the model to focus on and integrate richer information from various parts. Specifically our method first partitions features into distinct parts by cropping instances yielding part-level labels associated with these various parts. Subsequently we introduce a novel single-to-multiple transition matrix to model the relationship between the noisy and part-level labels which incorporates part-level labels into a classifier-consistent framework. Utilizing this framework with part-level labels we can learn the noisy class posteriors more precisely by guiding the model to integrate information from various parts ultimately improving the classification performance. Our method is theoretically sound while experiments show that it is empirically effective in synthetic and real-world noisy benchmarks."},
{"title": "Jointly Training and Pruning CNNs via Learnable Agent Guidance and Alignment", "authors": "Alireza Ganjdanesh, Shangqian Gao, Heng Huang", "abstract": "Structural model pruning is a prominent approach used for reducing the computational cost of Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) before their deployment on resource-constrained devices. Yet the majority of proposed ideas require a pretrained model before pruning which is costly to secure. In this paper we propose a novel structural pruning approach to jointly learn the weights and structurally prune architectures of CNN models. The core element of our method is a Reinforcement Learning (RL) agent whose actions determine the pruning ratios of the CNN model's layers and the resulting model's accuracy serves as its reward. We conduct the joint training and pruning by iteratively training the model's weights and the agent's policy and we regularize the model's weights to align with the selected structure by the agent. The evolving model's weights result in a dynamic reward function for the agent which prevents using prominent episodic RL methods with stationary environment assumption for our purpose. We address this challenge by designing a mechanism to model the complex changing dynamics of the reward function and provide a representation of it to the RL agent. To do so we take a learnable embedding for each training epoch and employ a recurrent model to calculate a representation of the changing environment. We train the recurrent model and embeddings using a decoder model to reconstruct observed rewards. Such a design empowers our agent to effectively leverage episodic observations along with the environment representations to learn a proper policy to determine performant sub-networks of the CNN model. Our extensive experiments on CIFAR-10 and ImageNet using ResNets and MobileNets demonstrate the effectiveness of our method."},

Existing methods (data-driven or using reinforcement learning) are limited in terms of generalization and motion naturalness. A primary obstacle is the scarcity of training data that combines locomotion with goal reaching. To address this we introduce WANDR a data-driven model that takes an avatar's initial pose and a goal's 3D position and generates natural human motions that place the end effector (wrist) on the goal location. To solve this we introduce novel intention features that drive rich goal-oriented movement. Intention guides the agent to the goal and interactively adapts the generation to novel situations without needing to define sub-goals or the entire motion path. Crucially intention allows training on datasets that have goal-oriented motions as well as those that do not. WANDR is a conditional Variational Auto-Encoder (c-VAE) which we train using the AMASS and CIRCLE datasets. We evaluate our method extensively and demonstrate its ability to generate natural and long-term motions that reach 3D goals and generalize to unseen goal locations.

However the substantial computational demands of state-of-the-art (SoTA) models often limit their widespread deployment. This paper addresses this challenge by introducing network binarization to compress resource-intensive multi-task dense predictors. Specifically our goal is to significantly accelerate multi-task dense prediction models via Binary Neural Networks (BNNs) while maintaining and even improving model performance at the same time. To reach this goal we propose a Binary Multi-task Dense Predictor Bi-MTDP and several variants of \\bimtdp in which a multi-task dense predictor is constructed via specified binarized modules. Our systematical analysis of this predictor reveals that performance drop from binarization is primarily caused by severe information degradation. To address this issue we introduce a deep information bottleneck layer that enforces representations for downstream tasks satisfying Gaussian distribution in forward propagation. Moreover we introduce a knowledge distillation mechanism to correct the direction of information flow in backward propagation. Intriguingly one variant of Bi-MTDP outperforms full-precision (FP) multi-task dense prediction SoTAs ARTC (CNN-based) and InvPT (ViT-based). This result indicates that Bi-MTDP is not merely a naive trade-off between performance and efficiency but is rather a benefit of the redundant information flow thanks to the multi-task architecture."},

Most existing methods are CNN-based and estimate optical flow from the source image to the current driving frame which is then inpainted and refined to produce the output animation. We propose a transformer-based encoder for computing a set-latent representation of the source image(s). We then predict the output color of a query pixel using a transformer-based decoder which is conditioned with keypoints and a facial expression vector extracted from the driving frame. Latent representations of the source person are learned in a self-supervised manner that factorize their appearance head pose and facial expressions. Thus they are perfectly suited for cross-reenactment. In contrast to most related work our method naturally extends to multiple source images and can thus adapt to person-specific facial dynamics. We also propose data augmentation and regularization schemes that are necessary to prevent overfitting and support generalizability of the learned representations. We evaluated our approach in a randomized user study. The results indicate superior performance compared to the state-of-the-art in terms of motion transfer quality and temporal consistency."},

Current approaches straightforwardly convert video into language tokens and employ large language models for multi-modal tasks. However this method often leads to the generation of irrelevant content commonly known as \"hallucination\" as the length of the text increases and the impact of the video diminishes. To address this problem we propose Vista-LLaMA a novel framework that maintains the consistent distance between all visual tokens and any language tokens irrespective of the generated text length. Vista-LLaMA omits relative position encoding when determining attention weights between visual and text tokens retaining the position encoding for text and text tokens. This amplifies the effect of visual tokens on text generation especially when the relative distance is longer between visual and text tokens. The proposed attention mechanism significantly reduces the chance of producing irrelevant text related to the video content. Furthermore we present a sequential visual projector that projects the current video frame into tokens of language space with the assistance of the previous frame. This approach not only captures the temporal relationship within the video but also allows less visual tokens to encompass the entire video. Our approach significantly outperforms various previous methods (e.g. Video-ChatGPT MovieChat) on four challenging open-ended video question answering benchmarks.

In this work we introduce Spherical Mask a novel coarse-to-fine approach based on spherical representation overcoming those two limitations with several benefits. Specifically our coarse detection estimates each instance with a 3D polygon using a center and radial distance predictions which avoids excessive size estimation of AABB. To cut the error propagation in the existing coarse-to-fine approaches we virtually migrate points based on the polygon allowing all foreground points including false negatives to be refined. During inference the proposal and point migration modules run in parallel and are assembled to form binary masks of instances. We also introduce two margin-based losses for the point migration to enforce corrections for the false positives/negatives and cohesion of foreground points significantly improving the performance.

To cope with the rarity of training examples this paper proposes IbM2 an instance-based max-margin method not only for the new pFSL setting but also works well in traditional FSL scenarios. Based on the Gaussian Annulus Theorem IbM2 converts random noise applied to the instances into a mechanism to achieve maximum margin in the many-way pFSL (or traditional FSL) recognition task. Experiments with various self-supervised pre-training methods and diverse many- or few-way FSL tasks show that IbM2 almost always leads to improvements compared to its respective baseline methods and in most cases the improvements are significant.

{"title": "Batch Normalization Alleviates the Spectral Bias in Coordinate Networks", "authors": "Zhicheng Cai, Hao Zhu, Qiu Shen, Xinran Wang, Xun Cao", "abstract": "Representing signals using coordinate networks dominates the area of inverse problems recently and is widely applied in various scientific computing tasks. Still there exists an issue of spectral bias in coordinate networks limiting the capacity to learn high-frequency components. This problem is caused by the pathological distribution of the neural tangent kernel's (NTK's) eigenvalues of coordinate networks. We find that this pathological distribution could be improved using the classical batch normalization (BN) which is a common deep learning technique but rarely used in coordinate networks. BN greatly reduces the maximum and variance of NTK's eigenvalues while slightly modifies the mean value considering the max eigenvalue is much larger than the most this variance change results in a shift of eigenvalues' distribution from a lower one to a higher one therefore the spectral bias could be alleviated (see Fig. 1). This observation is substantiated by the significant improvements of applying BN-based coordinate networks to various tasks including the image compression computed tomography reconstruction shape representation magnetic resonance imaging and novel view synthesis."},
{"title": "Efficient Scene Recovery Using Luminous Flux Prior", "authors": "Zhongyu Li, Lei Zhang", "abstract": "Scene recovery the restoration of images degraded by adverse weather conditions presents significant challenges for existing methods. Physical models constrained by their inherent assumptions often fail when these assumptions are not met; Deep learning models are powerful they are limited by the diversity of their training datasets leading to poor generalization and high computational demands. To address these limitations we propose the Luminous Flux Prior (LFP) to recover degraded images under diverse adverse weather without learning. Luminous flux a physical measure that reflects image brightness has a rate of change that demonstrates a significant correlation with transmission. Consequently we leverage this rate of change in luminous flux as prior knowledge to estimate transmission which in turn assists in image recovery. This approach reduces dependency on physical parameters and enhances adaptability to various weather. Experimental validation under diverse conditions such as sandstorms underwater environments and haze attests to the robustness of LFP in restoring clear images. With a time complexity of \\mathcal O (N\\log N) LFP enables real-time recovery making it a suitable for devices with limited computational resources."},

Common approaches to CVGL rely on ground-satellite image pairs and employ label-driven supervised training. However the cost of collecting precise cross-view image pairs hinders the deployment of CVGL in real-life scenarios. Without the pairs CVGL will be more challenging to handle the significant imaging and spatial gaps between ground and satellite images. To this end we propose an unsupervised framework including a cross-view projection to guide the model for retrieving initial pseudo-labels and a fast re-ranking mechanism to refine the pseudo-labels by leveraging the fact that \"the perfectly paired ground-satellite image is located in a unique and identical scene\". The framework exhibits competitive performance compared with supervised works on three open-source benchmarks. Our code and models will be released on https://github.com/liguopeng0923/UCVGL."},

We hypothesize that the most common pre-training strategy of relying on general purpose object-centric image datasets such as ImageNet is limited by an important domain shift. On the other hand collecting domain-specific ground truth such as 2D or 3D labels does not scale well. Therefore we propose a pre-training approach based on self-supervised learning that works on human-centric data using only images. Our method uses pairs of images of humans: the first is partially masked and the model is trained to reconstruct the masked parts given the visible ones and a second image. It relies on both stereoscopic (cross-view) pairs and temporal (cross-pose) pairs taken from videos in order to learn priors about 3D as well as human motion. We pre-train a model for body-centric tasks and one for hand-centric tasks. With a generic transformer architecture these models outperform existing self-supervised pre-training methods on a wide set of human-centric downstream tasks and obtain state-of-the-art performance for instance when fine-tuning for model-based and model-free human mesh recovery."},

Existing methods only rely on the features extracted at support keypoints to predict or refine the keypoints on query image but a few support feature vectors are local and inadequate for CAPE. Considering that human can quickly perceive potential keypoints of arbitrary objects we propose a novel framework for CAPE based on such potential keypoints (named as meta-points). Specifically we maintain learnable embeddings to capture inherent information of various keypoints which interact with image feature maps to produce meta-points without any support. The produced meta-points could serve as meaningful potential keypoints for CAPE. Due to the inevitable gap between inherency and annotation we finally utilize the identities and details offered by support keypoints to assign and refine meta-points to desired keypoints in query image. In addition we propose a progressive deformable point decoder and a slacked regression loss for better prediction and supervision. Our novel framework not only reveals the inherency of keypoints but also outperforms existing methods of CAPE. Comprehensive experiments and in-depth studies on large-scale MP-100 dataset demonstrate the effectiveness of our framework."},

But they require either a fairly dense sampling of the viewing sphere or pre-training on an existing dataset thereby limiting their generalizability. In contrast photometric stereo (PS) approaches have shown great potential for achieving high-quality reconstruction under sparse viewpoints. Yet they are impractical because they typically require tedious laboratory conditions are restricted to dark rooms and often multi-staged making them subject to accumulated errors. To address these shortcomings we propose an end-to-end uncalibrated multi-view PS framework for reconstructing high-resolution shapes acquired from sparse viewpoints in a real-world environment. We relax the dark room assumption and allow a combination of static ambient lighting and dynamic near LED lighting thereby enabling easy data capture outside the lab. Experimental validation confirms that it outperforms existing baseline approaches in the regime of sparse viewpoints by a large margin. This allows to bring high accuracy 3D reconstruction from the dark room to the real world while maintaining a reasonable data capture complexity."},

In this work we address this limitation by studying camera-based 3D panoptic segmentation aiming to achieve a unified occupancy representation for camera-only 3D scene understanding. To achieve this we introduce a novel method called PanoOcc which utilizes voxel queries to aggregate spatiotemporal information from multi-frame and multi-view images in a coarse-to-fine scheme integrating feature learning and scene representation into a unified occupancy representation. We have conducted extensive ablation studies to validate the effectiveness and efficiency of the proposed method. Our approach achieves new state-of-the-art results for camera-based semantic segmentation and panoptic segmentation on the nuScenes dataset.

{"title": "Global Latent Neural Rendering", "authors": "Thomas Tanay, Matteo Maggioni", "abstract": "A recent trend among generalizable novel view synthesis methods is to learn a rendering operator acting over single camera rays. This approach is promising because it removes the need for explicit volumetric rendering but it effectively treats target images as collections of independent pixels. Here we propose to learn a global rendering operator acting over all camera rays jointly. We show that the right representation to enable such rendering is a 5-dimensional plane sweep volume consisting of the projection of the input images on a set of planes facing the target camera. Based on this understanding we introduce our Convolutional Global Latent Renderer (ConvGLR) an efficient convolutional architecture that performs the rendering operation globally in a low-resolution latent space.

In this paper we propose HumanNorm a novel approach for high-quality and realistic 3D human generation. The main idea is to enhance the model's 2D perception of 3D geometry by learning a normal-adapted diffusion model and a normal-aligned diffusion model. The normal-adapted diffusion model can generate high-fidelity normal maps corresponding to user prompts with view-dependent and body-aware text. The normal-aligned diffusion model learns to generate color images aligned with the normal maps thereby transforming physical geometry details into realistic appearance. Leveraging the proposed normal diffusion model we devise a progressive geometry generation strategy and a multi-step Score Distillation Sampling (SDS) loss to enhance the performance of 3D human generation.

Existing PTS methods however undergo significant performance degradation compared with traditional methods that retrain the sparse networks via the whole dataset especially at high sparsity ratios. In this paper we attempt to reconcile this disparity by transposing three cardinal factors that profoundly alter the performance of conventional sparsity into the context of PTS. Our endeavors particularly comprise (1) A base-decayed sparsity objective that promotes efficient knowledge transferring from dense network to the sparse counterpart. (2) A reducing-regrowing search algorithm designed to ascertain the optimal sparsity distribution while circumventing overfitting to the small calibration set in PTS. (3) The employment of dynamic sparse training predicated on the preceding aspects aimed at comprehensively optimizing the sparsity structure while ensuring training stability.

Given a partially-observed object in an arbitrary pose we first canonicalize the object by extracting point-wise affine invariant features disentangling inherent structure of the object with its pose and size. These learned features are then leveraged to predict semantically consistent part segmentation and corresponding part centers. Next our lightweight retrieval module aggregates the features within each part as its retrieval token and compare all the tokens with source shapes from a pre-established database to identify the most geometrically similar shape. Finally we deform the retrieved shape in the deformation module to tightly fit the input object by harnessing part center guided neural cage deformation. The key insight of ShapeMaker is the simultaneous training of the four highly-associated processes: canonicalization segmentation retrieval and deformation leveraging cross-task consistency losses for mutual supervision.

This paper proposes to resolve the above issues from a spatial-temporal modeling perspective. First we propose a novel Temporally-smooth Procrustean Alignment module that estimates 3D deforming shapes and adjusts the camera motion by aligning the 3D shape sequence consecutively. Our new alignment module remedies the requirement of complex reference 3D shape during alignment which is more conductive to non-isotropic deformation modeling. Second we propose a spatial-weighted approach to enforce the low-rank constraint adaptively at different locations to accommodate drastic spatially-variant deformation reconstruction better. Our modeling outperform existing low-rank based methods and extensive experiments across different datasets validate the effectiveness of our method."},

Existing task-agnostic point cloud sampling strategy (e.g. FPS) does not consider semantic information of point clouds causing degraded performance on downstream tasks. While learning-based point cloud sampling methods consider semantic information they are task-specific and require task-oriented ground-truth annotations. So they cannot generalize well on different downstream tasks. Our LTA-PCS achieves task-agnostic point cloud sampling without requiring task-oriented labels in which both the geometric and semantic information of points is considered in sampling. Extensive experiments on multiple downstream tasks demonstrate the effectiveness of our LTA-PCS."},

Specifically datasets in multispectral pedestrian detection mainly distribute between ROTO (day) and RXTO (night) data; the majority of the pedestrian labels statistically co-occur with their thermal features. As a result multispectral pedestrian detectors show poor generalization ability on examples beyond this statistical correlation such as ROTX data. To address this problem we propose a novel Causal Mode Multiplexer (CMM) framework that effectively learns the causalities between multispectral inputs and predictions. Moreover we construct a new dataset (ROTX-MP) to evaluate modality bias in multispectral pedestrian detection. ROTX-MP mainly includes ROTX examples not presented in previous datasets.

However existing advanced methods often overlook the diversity among trajectories and the ambiguity and conflicts present in motion and appearance cues leading to confusion among detections trajectories and associations when performing simple global data association. To address this issue we propose a simple versatile and highly interpretable data association approach called Decomposed Data Association (DDA). DDA decomposes the traditional association problem into multiple sub-problems using a series of non-learning-based modules and selectively addresses the confusion in each sub-problem by incorporating targeted exploitation of new cues. Additionally we introduce Occlusion-aware Non-Maximum Suppression (ONMS) to retain more occluded detections thereby increasing opportunities for association with trajectories and indirectly reducing the confusion caused by missed detections. Finally based on DDA and ONMS we design a powerful multi-object tracker named DeconfuseTrack specifically focused on resolving confusion in MOT. Extensive experiments conducted on the MOT17 and MOT20 datasets demonstrate that our proposed DDA and ONMS significantly enhance the performance of several popular trackers. Moreover DeconfuseTrack achieves state-of-the-art performance on the MOT17 and MOT20 test sets significantly outperforms the baseline tracker ByteTrack in metrics such as HOTA IDF1 AssA.

However these continuous image representations typically implement decoding in High-Resolution (HR) High-Dimensional (HD) space leading to a quadratic increase in computational cost and seriously hindering the practical applications of ASSR. To tackle this problem we propose a novel Latent Modulated Function (LMF) which decouples the HR-HD decoding process into shared latent decoding in LR-HD space and independent rendering in HR Low-Dimensional (LD) space thereby realizing the first computational optimal paradigm of continuous image representation. Specifically LMF utilizes an HD MLP in latent space to generate latent modulations of each LR feature vector. This enables a modulated LD MLP in render space to quickly adapt to any input feature vector and perform rendering at arbitrary resolution. Furthermore we leverage the positive correlation between modulation intensity and input image complexity to design a Controllable Multi-Scale Rendering (CMSR) algorithm offering the flexibility to adjust the decoding efficiency based on the rendering precision.

Our approach which we call UNITE uses an image teacher model to adapt a video student model to the target domain. UNITE first employs self-supervised pre-training to promote discriminative feature learning on target domain videos using a teacher-guided masked distillation objective. We then perform self-training on masked target data using the video student model and image teacher model together to generate improved pseudolabels for unlabeled target videos. Our self-training process successfully leverages the strengths of both models to achieve strong transfer performance across domains. We evaluate our approach on multiple video domain adaptation benchmarks and observe significant improvements upon previously reported results."},
{"title": "Towards Backward-Compatible Continual Learning of Image Compression", "authors": "Zhihao Duan, Ming Lu, Justin Yang, Jiangpeng He, Zhan Ma, Fengqing Zhu", "abstract": "This paper explores the possibility of extending the capability of pre-trained neural image compressors (e.g. adapting to new data or target bitrates) without breaking backward compatibility the ability to decode bitstreams encoded by the original model. We refer to this problem as continual learning of image compression. Our initial findings show that baseline solutions such as end-to-end fine-tuning do not preserve the desired backward compatibility. To tackle this we propose a knowledge replay training strategy that effectively addresses this issue. We also design a new model architecture that enables more effective continual learning than existing baselines. Experiments are conducted for two scenarios: data-incremental learning and rate-incremental learning. The main conclusion of this paper is that neural image compressors can be fine-tuned to achieve better performance (compared to their pre-trained version) on new data and rates without compromising backward compatibility. The code is publicly available online."},
{"title": "CAMixerSR: Only Details Need More \"Attention\"", "authors": "Yan Wang, Yi Liu, Shijie Zhao, Junlin Li, Li Zhang", "abstract": "To satisfy the rapidly increasing demands on the large image (2K-8K) super-resolution (SR) prevailing methods follow two independent tracks: 1) accelerate existing networks by content-aware routing and 2) design better super-resolution networks via token mixer refining. Despite directness they encounter unavoidable defects (e.g. inflexible route or non-discriminative processing) limiting further improvements of quality-complexity trade-off. To erase the drawbacks we integrate these schemes by proposing a content-aware mixer (CAMixer) which assigns convolution for simple contexts and additional deformable window-attention for sparse textures. Specifically the CAMixer uses a learnable predictor to generate multiple bootstraps including offsets for windows warping a mask for classifying windows and convolutional attentions for endowing convolution with the dynamic property which modulates attention to include more useful textures self-adaptively and improves the representation capability of convolution. We further introduce a global classification loss to improve the accuracy of predictors. By simply stacking CAMixers we obtain CAMixerSR which achieves superior performance on large-image SR lightweight SR and omnidirectional-image SR."},

However due to the unordered and non-uniform density characteristics of point clouds it is non-trivial to explore the prior knowledge of point clouds and pre-train a point cloud backbone. In this paper we propose a novel pre-training method called Point cloud Diffusion pre-training PointDif. We consider the point cloud pre-training task as a conditional point-to-point generation problem and introduce a conditional point generator. This generator aggregates the features extracted by the backbone and employs them as the condition to guide the point-to-point recovery from the noisy point cloud thereby assisting the backbone in capturing both local and global geometric priors as well as the global point density distribution of the object. We also present a recurrent uniform sampling optimization strategy which enables the model to uniformly recover from various noise levels and learn from balanced supervision. Our PointDif achieves substantial improvement across various real-world datasets for diverse downstream tasks such as classification segmentation and detection. Specifically PointDif attains 70.0% mIoU on S3DIS Area 5 for the segmentation task and achieves an average improvement of 2.4% on ScanObjectNN for the classification task compared to TAP. Furthermore our pre-training framework can be flexibly applied to diverse point cloud backbones and bring considerable gains. Code is available at https://github.com/zhengxiaozx/PointDif"},

However most of the current methods primarily focus on global or subject-level modifications and often face limitations when it comes to editing specific objects when there are other objects coexisting in the scene given solely textual prompts. In response to this challenge we introduce an object-level generative task called Referring Image Editing (RIE) which enables the identification and editing of specific source objects in an image using text prompts. To tackle this task effectively we propose a tailored framework called ReferDiffusion. It aims to disentangle input prompts into multiple embeddings and employs a mixed-supervised multi-stage training strategy. To facilitate further research in this domain we introduce the RefCOCO-Edit dataset comprising images editing prompts source object segmentation masks and reference edited images for training and evaluation. Our extensive experiments demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach in identifying and editing target objects while conventional general image editing and region-based image editing methods have difficulties in this challenging task."},

Pretrained vision-and-language models have addressed this problem by providing a text description as the answer. However in visual scenes with multiple entities textual descriptions struggle to distinguish the entities from the same category effectively. Consequently the VQA dataset is limited by the limitations of text description and cannot adequately cover scenarios involving multiple entities. To address this challenge we introduce a Mask for Align (Mask4Align) method which can determine the entity's position in the given image that best matches the user-input question. This method incorporates colored masks into the image enabling the VQA model to handle discrimination and localization challenges associated with multiple entities. To process an arbitrary number of similar entities Mask4Align is designed hierarchically to discern subtle differences achieving precise localization. Since Mask4Align directly utilizes pre-trained models it does not introduce additional training overhead. Extensive experiments conducted on both the gaze target prediction task dataset and our proposed multi-entity localization dataset showcase the superiority of Mask4Align."},

Despite quantities of existing works most of them focus on detecting out-of-distribution (OOD) samples from unseen classes while ignoring large parts of relevant failure sources like misclassified samples from known classes. In particular recent studies reveal that prevalent OOD detection methods are actually harmful for misclassification detection (MisD) indicating that there seems to be a tradeoff between those two tasks. In this paper we study the critical yet under-explored problem of unified failure detection which aims to detect both misclassified and OOD examples. Concretely we identify the failure of simply integrating learning objectives of misclassification and OOD detection and show the potential of sequence learning. Inspired by this we propose a reliable continual learning paradigm whose spirit is to equip the model with MisD ability first and then improve the OOD detection ability without degrading the already adequate MisD performance.

Due to the chaotic evolution nature of the precipitation systems it is a very challenging problem. Previous studies address the problem either from the perspectives of deterministic modeling or probabilistic modeling. However their predictions suffer from the blurry high-value echoes fading away and position inaccurate issues. The root reason of these issues is that the chaotic evolutionary precipitation systems are not appropriately modeled. Inspired by the nature of the systems we propose to decompose and model them from the perspective of global deterministic motion and local stochastic variations with residual mechanism. A unified and flexible framework that can equip any type of spatio-temporal models is proposed based on residual diffusion which effectively tackles the shortcomings of previous methods.

Instead it focuses on overcoming the existing trade-offs between accuracy and efficiency within the context of point cloud processing leveraging the power of scale. Drawing inspiration from recent advances in 3D large-scale representation learning we recognize that model performance is more influenced by scale than by intricate design. Therefore we present Point Transformer V3 (PTv3) which prioritizes simplicity and efficiency over the accuracy of certain mechanisms that are minor to the overall performance after scaling such as replacing the precise neighbor search by KNN with an efficient serialized neighbor mapping of point clouds organized with specific patterns. This principle enables significant scaling expanding the receptive field from 16 to 1024 points while remaining efficient (a 3x increase in processing speed and a 10x improvement in memory efficiency compared with its predecessor PTv2). PTv3 attains state-of-the-art results on over 20 downstream tasks that span both indoor and outdoor scenarios.

Most instance segmentation datasets today require costly manual annotation limiting their data scale. Models trained on such data are prone to overfitting on the training set especially for those rare categories. While recent works have delved into exploiting generative models to create synthetic datasets for data augmentation these approaches do not efficiently harness the full potential of generative models. To address these issues we introduce a more efficient strategy to construct generative datasets for data augmentation termed DiverGen. Firstly we provide an explanation of the role of generative data from the perspective of distribution discrepancy. We investigate the impact of different data on the distribution learned by the model. We argue that generative data can expand the data distribution that the model can learn thus mitigating overfitting. Additionally we find that the diversity of generative data is crucial for improving model performance and enhance it through various strategies including category diversity prompt diversity and generative model diversity. With these strategies we can scale the data to millions while maintaining the trend of model performance improvement. On the LVIS dataset DiverGen significantly outperforms the strong model X-Paste achieving +1.1 box AP and +1.1 mask AP across all categories and +1.9 box AP and +2.5 mask AP for rare categories.

The objective of this task is to learn the co-existing action from limited data and generalize it to unseen humans or even animals. Experimental results show that existing subject-driven customization methods fail to learn the representative characteristics of actions and struggle in decoupling actions from context features including appearance. To overcome the preference for low-level features and the entanglement of high-level features we propose an inversion-based method Action-Disentangled Identifier (ADI) to learn action-specific identifiers from the exemplar images. ADI first expands the semantic conditioning space by introducing layer-wise identifier tokens thereby increasing the representational richness while distributing the inversion across different features. Then to block the inversion of action-agnostic features ADI extracts the gradient invariance from the constructed sample triples and masks the updates of irrelevant channels. To comprehensively evaluate the task we present an ActionBench that includes a variety of actions each accompanied by meticulously selected samples. Both quantitative and qualitative results show that our ADI outperforms existing baselines in action-customized T2I generation. Our project page is at https://adi-t2i.github.io/ADI."},

Dr2Net contains two types of residual connections one maintaining the residual structure in the pretrained models and the other making the network reversible. Due to its reversibility intermediate activations which can be reconstructed from output are cleared from memory during training. We use two coefficients on either type of residual connections respectively and introduce a dynamic training strategy that seamlessly transitions the pretrained model to a reversible network with much higher numerical precision. We evaluate Dr2Net on various pretrained models and various tasks and show that it can reach comparable performance to conventional finetuning but with significantly less memory usage."},

This approach modifies objects or object properties in images by manipulating feature components in attention layers during the generation process. Nevertheless little is known about the semantic meanings that these attention layers have learned and which parts of the attention maps contribute to the success of image editing. In this paper we conduct an in-depth probing analysis and demonstrate that cross-attention maps in Stable Diffusion often contain object attribution information which can result in editing failures. In contrast self-attention maps play a crucial role in preserving the geometric and shape details of the source image during the transformation to the target image. Our analysis offers valuable insights into understanding cross and self-attention mechanisms in diffusion models. Furthermore based on our findings we propose a simplified yet more stable and efficient tuning-free procedure that modifies only the self-attention maps of specified attention layers during the denoising process.

Traditional techniques in the game industry can produce high-fidelity animations but suffer from high computational costs and poor scalability. Trained neural network models alleviate the memory and speed issues yet fall short on generating diverse motions. Diffusion models offer diverse motion synthesis with low memory usage but require expensive reverse diffusion processes. This paper introduces the Accelerated Auto-regressive Motion Diffusion Model (AAMDM) a novel motion synthesis framework designed to achieve quality diversity and efficiency all together. AAMDM integrates Denoising Diffusion GANs as a fast Generation Module and an Auto-regressive Diffusion Model as a Polishing Module. Furthermore AAMDM operates in a lower-dimensional embedded space rather than the full-dimensional pose space which reduces the training complexity as well as further improves the performance. We show that AAMDM outperforms existing methods in motion quality diversity and runtime efficiency through comprehensive quantitative analyses and visual comparisons. We also demonstrate the effectiveness of each algorithmic component through ablation studies."},

Nevertheless SSL methods have considerable room for performance improvement when compared to fully-supervised DG training. To tackle this underexplored yet highly practical problem of SSDG we make the following core contributions. First we propose a feature-based conformity technique that matches the posterior distributions from the feature space with the pseudo-label from the model's output space. Second we develop a semantics alignment loss to learn semantically-compatible representations by regularizing the semantic structure in the feature space. Our method is plug-and-play and can be readily integrated with different SSL-based SSDG baselines without introducing any additional parameters. Extensive experimental results across five challenging DG benchmarks with four strong SSL baselines suggest that our method provides consistent and notable gains in two different SSDG settings."},

CNNs and window-attention methods are two major categories of canonical SR models. However these measures are rigid: in both operations each pixel gathers the same number of neighboring pixels hindering their effectiveness in SR tasks. Alternatively we leverage the flexibility of graphs and propose the Image Processing GNN (IPG) model to break the rigidity that dominates previous SR methods. Firstly SR is unbalanced in that most reconstruction efforts are concentrated to a small proportion of detail-rich image parts. Hence we leverage degree flexibility by assigning higher node degrees to detail-rich image nodes. Then in order to construct graphs for SR-effective aggregation we treat images as pixel node sets rather than patch nodes. Lastly we hold that both local and global information are crucial for SR performance. In the hope of gathering pixel information from both local and global scales efficiently via flexible graphs we search node connections within nearby regions to construct local graphs; and find connections within a strided sampling space of the whole image for global graphs. The flexibility of graphs boosts the SR performance of the IPG model. Experiment results on various datasets demonstrates that the proposed IPG outperforms State-of-the-Art baselines.

Recently considering diverse deployment scenarios with various resource budgets SN-Net is introduced to quickly obtain numerous new networks (stitches) from the pre-trained models (anchors) in a model family via model stitching. Although promising SN-Net confronts new challenges when adapting it to new target domains including huge memory and storage requirements and a long and sub-optimal multistage adaptation process. In this work we present a novel framework Efficient Stitchable Task Adaptation (ESTA) to efficiently produce a palette of fine-tuned models that adhere to diverse resource constraints. Specifically we first tailor parameter-efficient fine-tuning to share low-rank updates among the stitches while maintaining independent bias terms. In this way we largely reduce fine-tuning memory burdens and mitigate the interference among stitches that arises in task adaptation. Furthermore we streamline a simple yet effective one-stage deployment pipeline which estimates the important stitches to deploy with training-time gradient statistics. By assigning higher sampling probabilities to important stitches we also get a boosted Pareto frontier. Extensive experiments on 25 downstream visual recognition tasks demonstrate that our ESTA is capable of generating stitches with smooth accuracy-efficiency trade-offs and surpasses the direct SN-Net adaptation by remarkable margins with significantly lower training time and fewer trainable parameters. Furthermore we demonstrate the flexibility and scalability of our ESTA framework by stitching LLMs from LLaMA family obtaining chatbot stitches of assorted sizes."},
{"title": "Attentive Illumination Decomposition Model for Multi-Illuminant White Balancing", "authors": "Dongyoung Kim, Jinwoo Kim, Junsang Yu, Seon Joo Kim", "abstract": "White balance (WB) algorithms in many commercial cameras assume single and uniform illumination leading to undesirable results when multiple lighting sources with different chromaticities exist in the scene. Prior research on multi-illuminant WB typically predicts illumination at the pixel level without fully grasping the scene's actual lighting conditions including the number and color of light sources. This often results in unnatural outcomes lacking in overall consistency. To handle this problem we present a deep white balancing model that leverages the slot attention where each slot is in charge of representing individual illuminants. This design enables the model to generate chromaticities and weight maps for individual illuminants which are then fused to compose the final illumination map. Furthermore we propose the centroid-matching loss which regulates the activation of each slot based on the color range thereby enhancing the model to separate illumination more effectively. Our method achieves the state-of-the-art performance on both single- and multi-illuminant WB benchmarks and also offers additional information such as the number of illuminants in the scene and their chromaticity. This capability allows for illumination editing an application not feasible with prior methods."},

It works by training a simple transparent (surrogate) model using random samples drawn around the neighborhood of the instance (image) to be explained (IE). Explanations are then extracted for a black-box model and a given IE using the surrogate model. However the explanations of LIME suffer from inconsistency across different runs for the same model and the same IE. We identify two main types of inconsistencies: variance in the sign and importance ranks of the segments (superpixels). These factors hinder LIME from obtaining consistent explanations. We analyze these inconsistencies and propose a new method Stabilized LIME for Consistent Explanations (SLICE). The proposed method handles the stabilization problem in two aspects: using a novel feature selection technique to eliminate spurious superpixels and an adaptive perturbation technique to generate perturbed images in the neighborhood of IE. Our results demonstrate that the explanations from SLICE exhibit significantly better consistency and fidelity than LIME (and its variant BayLime)."},

Current advanced methods which involve designing deeper networks or adding more self-attention modules are limited by the scope of attention modules and the irrelevance of attentions across different dimensions. This leads to difficulties in capturing non-local mutation features in the spatial-spectral domain and results in a significant parameter increase but only limited performance improvement. To address these issues we propose SPECAT a SPatial-spEctral Cumulative-Attention Transformer designed for high-resolution hyperspectral image reconstruction. SPECAT utilizes Cumulative-Attention Blocks (CABs) within an efficient hierarchical framework to extract features from non-local spatial-spectral details. Furthermore it employs a projection-object Dual-domain Loss Function (DLF) to integrate the optical path constraint a physical aspect often overlooked in current methodologies. Ultimately SPECAT not only significantly enhances the reconstruction quality of spectral details but also breaks through the bottleneck of mutual restriction between the cost and accuracy in existing algorithms. Our experimental results demonstrate the superiority of SPECAT achieving 40.3 dB in hyperspectral reconstruction benchmarks outperforming the state-of-the-art (SOTA) algorithms by 1.2 dB while using only 5% of the network parameters and 10% of the computational cost.

Benefiting from the prior knowledge illustrated by the seen anomalies current OSAD methods can often largely reduce false positive errors. However these methods are trained in a closed-set setting and treat the anomaly examples as from a homogeneous distribution rendering them less effective in generalizing to unseen anomalies that can be drawn from any distribution. This paper proposes to learn heterogeneous anomaly distributions using the limited anomaly examples to address this issue. To this end we introduce a novel approach namely Anomaly Heterogeneity Learning (AHL) that simulates a diverse set of heterogeneous anomaly distributions and then utilizes them to learn a unified heterogeneous abnormality model in surrogate open-set environments. Further AHL is a generic framework that existing OSAD models can plug and play for enhancing their abnormality modeling. Extensive experiments on nine real-world anomaly detection datasets show that AHL can 1) substantially enhance different state-of-the-art OSAD models in detecting seen and unseen anomalies and 2) effectively generalize to unseen anomalies in new domains.

The design process typically involves specifying a set of spatial constraints that include object attributes like size and inter-object relations such as relative positioning. Existing works which typically represent objects as single nodes lack the granularity to accurately model complex interactions between objects. For instance often only certain parts of an object like a room's right wall interact with adjacent objects. To address this gap we introduce a factor graph based approach with four latent variable nodes for each room and a factor node for each constraint. The factor nodes represent dependencies among the variables to which they are connected effectively capturing constraints that are potentially of a higher order. We then develop message-passing on the bipartite graph forming a factor graph neural network that is trained to produce a floorplan that aligns with the desired requirements. Our approach is simple and generates layouts faithful to the user requirements demonstrated by a large improvement in IOU scores over existing methods. Additionally our approach being inferential and accurate is well-suited to the practical human-in-the-loop design process where specifications evolve iteratively offering a practical and powerful tool for AI-guided design."},

While previous studies have mostly focused on offline action segmentation where entire videos are available for both training and inference the transition to online action segmentation is crucial for practical applications like AR/VR task assistants. Notably applying an offline-trained model directly to online inference results in a significant performance drop due to the inconsistency between training and inference. We propose an online action segmentation framework by first modifying existing architectures to make them causal. Second we develop a novel action progress prediction module to dynamically estimate the progress of ongoing actions and using them to refine the predictions of causal action segmentation. Third we propose to learn task graphs from training videos and leverage them to obtain smooth and procedure-consistent segmentations. With the combination of progress and task graph with casual action segmentation our framework effectively addresses prediction uncertainty and oversegmentation in online action segmentation and achieves significant improvement on three egocentric datasets."},

Unlike previous methods that either iteratively warp 2D views onto a mesh surface or distillate diffusion latent features without accurate geometric and style cues SceneTex formulates the texture synthesis task as an optimization problem in the RGB space where style and geometry consistency are properly reflected. At its core SceneTex proposes a multiresolution texture field to implicitly encode the mesh appearance. We optimize the target texture via a score-distillation-based objective function in respective RGB renderings. To further secure the style consistency across views we introduce a cross-attention decoder to predict the RGB values by cross-attending to the pre-sampled reference locations in each instance. SceneTex enables various and accurate texture synthesis for 3D-FRONT scenes demonstrating significant improvements in visual quality and prompt fidelity over the prior texture generation methods."},
{"title": "Towards Calibrated Multi-label Deep Neural Networks", "authors": "Jiacheng Cheng, Nuno Vasconcelos", "abstract": "The problem of calibrating deep neural networks (DNNs) for multi-label learning is considered. It is well-known that DNNs trained by cross-entropy for single-label or one-hot classification are poorly calibrated. Many calibration techniques have been proposed to address the problem. However little attention has been paid to the calibration of multi-label DNNs. In this literature the focus has been on improving labeling accuracy in the face of severe dataset unbalance. This is addressed by the introduction of asymmetric losses which have became very popular. However these losses do not induce well calibrated classifiers. In this work we first provide a theoretical explanation for this poor calibration performance by showing that these loses losses lack the strictly proper property a necessary condition for accurate probability estimation. To overcome this problem we propose a new Strictly Proper Asymmetric (SPA) loss. This is complemented by a Label Pair Regularizer (LPR) that increases the number of calibration constraints introduced per training example. The effectiveness of both contributions is validated by extensive experiments on various multi-label datasets. The resulting training method is shown to significantly decrease the calibration error while maintaining state-of-the-art accuracy."},

This is particularly relevant in search and retrieval systems where it is crucial to avoid reprocessing of the gallery images with the updated model. While recent research has shown promising empirical evidence there is still a lack of comprehensive theoretical understanding about learning compatible representations. In this paper we demonstrate that the stationary representations learned by the d-Simplex fixed classifier optimally approximate compatibility representation according to the two inequality constraints of its formal definition. This not only establishes a solid foundation for future works in this line of research but also presents implications that can be exploited in practical learning scenarios. An exemplary application is the now-standard practice of downloading and fine-tuning new pre-trained models. Specifically we show the strengths and critical issues of stationary representations in the case in which a model undergoing sequential fine-tuning is asynchronously replaced by downloading a better-performing model pre-trained elsewhere. Such a representation enables seamless delivery of retrieval service (i.e. no reprocessing of gallery images) and offers improved performance without operational disruptions during model replacement.

Previous work interprets vectors in an interpretable latent space of diffusion models as semantic concepts. However existing approaches cannot discover directions for arbitrary concepts such as those related to inappropriate concepts. In this work we propose a novel self-supervised approach to find interpretable latent directions for a given concept.

To enable practical and widespread applications recent advances propose to generate a clothed human from an RGB image. However they struggle to reconstruct detailed and robust avatars simultaneously. We empirically find that the high-frequency (HF) and low-frequency (LF) information from a parametric model has the potential to enhance geometry details and improve robustness to noise respectively. Based on this we propose HiLo namely clothed human reconstruction with high- and low-frequency information which contains two components. 1) To recover detailed geometry using HF information we propose a progressive HF Signed Distance Function to enhance the detailed 3D geometry of a clothed human. We analyze that our progressive learning manner alleviates large gradients that hinder model convergence. 2) To achieve robust reconstruction against inaccurate estimation of the parametric model by using LF information we propose a spatial interaction implicit function. This function effectively exploits the complementary spatial information from a low-resolution voxel grid of the parametric model. Experimental results demonstrate that HiLo outperforms the state-of-the-art methods by 10.43% and 9.54% in terms of Chamfer distance on the Thuman2.0 and CAPE datasets respectively.

In addition channel squeezing in representative ConvNets is carried out via 1 x 1 convolutions which dominates a large portion of computations and network parameters. Given these challenges we propose an effective multi-purpose module for dynamic channel sampling namely Pick-or-Mix (PiX) which does not require special implementation. PiX divides a set of channels into subsets and then picks from them where the picking decision is dynamically made per each pixel based on the input activations. We plug PiX into prominent ConvNet architectures and verify its multi-purpose utilities. After replacing 1 x 1 channel squeezing layers in ResNet with PiX the network becomes 25% faster without losing accuracy. We show that PiX allows ConvNets to learn better data representation than widely adopted approaches to enhance networks' representation power (e.g. SE CBAM AFF SKNet and DWP). We also show that PiX achieves state-of-the-art performance on network downscaling and dynamic channel pruning applications."},

While diffusion models use computationally expensive UNet-based denoising operations in every generation step we identify that not all operations are equally relevant for the final output quality. In particular we observe that UNet layers operating on high-res feature maps are relatively sensitive to small perturbations. In contrast low-res feature maps influence the semantic layout of the final image and can often be perturbed with no noticeable change in the output. Based on this observation we propose Clockwork Diffusion a method that periodically reuses computation from preceding denoising steps to approximate low-res feature maps at one or more subsequent steps. For multiple base- lines and for both text-to-image generation and image editing we demonstrate that Clockwork leads to comparable or improved perceptual scores with drastically reduced computational complexity.

Around each object there are usually multiple queries within which only a single one can win the chance to become the final detection. Such a competition is hard: while some competing queries initially have very close prediction scores their leading query has to dramatically enlarge its score superiority after several decoder layers. To help the leading query stands out this paper proposes EASE-DETR which eases the competition by introducing bias that favours the leading one. EASE-DETR is very simple: in every intermediate decoder layer we identify the \"leading / trailing\" relationship between any two queries and encode this binary relationship into the following decoder layer to amplify the superiority of the leading one. More concretely the leading query is to be protected from mutual query suppression in the self-attention layer and encouraged to absorb more object features in the cross-attention layer therefore accelerating to win. Experimental results show that EASE-DETR brings consistent and remarkable improvement to various DETRs."},

However existing methods attempt to extract domain-invariant features neglecting that the biased data leads the network to learn biased features that are non-causal and poorly generalizable. To this end we propose an Unbiased Faster R-CNN (UFR) for generalizable feature learning. Specifically we formulate SDG in object detection from a causal perspective and construct a Structural Causal Model (SCM) to analyze the data bias and feature bias in the task which are caused by scene confounders and object attribute confounders. Based on the SCM we design a Global-Local Transformation module for data augmentation which effectively simulates domain diversity and mitigates the data bias. Additionally we introduce a Causal Attention Learning module that incorporates a designed attention invariance loss to learn image-level features that are robust to scene confounders. Moreover we develop a Causal Prototype Learning module with an explicit instance constraint and an implicit prototype constraint which further alleviates the negative impact of object attribute confounders. Experimental results on five scenes demonstrate the prominent generalization ability of our method with an improvement of 3.9% mAP on the Night-Clear scene."},

Equipped with Bayer color filter array (CFA) color spike camera (CSC) has been invented to capture color information. Although spike camera has already demonstrated great potential for high-speed imaging its spatial resolution is limited compared with conventional digital cameras. This paper proposes a Color Spike Camera Super-Resolution (CSCSR) network to super-resolve higher-resolution color images from spike camera streams with Bayer CFA. To be specific we first propose a representation for Bayer-pattern spike streams exploring local temporal information with global perception to represent the binary data. Then we exploit the CFA layout and sub-pixel level motion to collect temporal pixels for the spatial super-resolution of each color channel. In particular a residual-based module for feature refinement is developed to reduce the impact of motion estimation errors. Considering color correlation we jointly utilize the multi-stage temporal-pixel features of color channels to reconstruct the high-resolution color image.

Towards addressing this challenge we introduce MuLAn: a novel dataset comprising over 44K MUlti-Layer ANnotations of RGB images as multi-layer instance-wise RGBA decompositions and over 100K instance images. To build MuLAn we developed a training free pipeline which decomposes a monocular RGB image into a stack of RGBA layers comprising of background and isolated instances.

Current methods focus on singular facets of the problem---predicting only 2D/3D poses generating 2D pressure images predicting pressure only for certain body regions instead of the full body or forming indirect approximations to the 3D pressure map. In contrast we introduce BodyMAP which jointly predicts the human body mesh and 3D applied pressure map across the entire human body. Our network leverages multiple visual modalities incorporating both a depth image of a person in bed and its corresponding 2D pressure image acquired from a pressure-sensing mattress. The 3D pressure map is represented as a pressure value at each mesh vertex and thus allows for precise localization of high-pressure regions on the body.

Recently Source-free Universal Domain Adaptation (SF-UniDA) has emerged to achieve UniDA without access to source data which tends to be more practical due to data protection policies. The main challenge lies in determining whether covariate-shifted samples belong to target-private unknown categories. Existing methods tackle this either through hand-crafted thresholding or by developing time-consuming iterative clustering strategies. In this paper we propose a new idea of LEArning Decomposition (LEAD) which decouples features into source-known and -unknown components to identify target-private data. Technically LEAD initially leverages the orthogonal decomposition analysis for feature decomposition. Then LEAD builds instance-level decision boundaries to adaptively identify target-private data. Extensive experiments across various UniDA scenarios have demonstrated the effectiveness and superiority of LEAD. Notably in the OPDA scenario on VisDA dataset LEAD outperforms GLC by 3.5% overall H-score and reduces 75% time to derive pseudo-labeling decision boundaries.

Our proposed model achieves impressive intensity manipulation across 12 AUs trained effectively with only 18 subjects. Utilizing a dual-branch architecture our approach achieves comprehensive disentanglement of facial attributes and identity without necessitating additional loss functions or implementing with large batch sizes. This approach offers a potential solution to achieve desired facial attribute editing despite the dataset's limited subject count. Our experiments demonstrate AUEditNet's superior accuracy in editing AU intensities affirming its capability in disentangling facial attributes and identity within a limited subject pool. AUEditNet allows conditioning by either intensity values or target images eliminating the need for constructing AU combinations for specific facial expression synthesis. Moreover AU intensity estimation as a downstream task validates the consistency between real and edited images confirming the effectiveness of our proposed AU intensity manipulation method."},

Existing approaches typically rely on geometry constraints and dense depth estimates to facilitate the learning but often fail to fully exploit the benefits of three-dimensional feature extraction in frustum and 3D space. In this paper we propose OccupancyM3D a method of learning occupancy for monocular 3D detection. It directly learns occupancy in frustum and 3D space leading to more discriminative and informative 3D features and representations. Specifically by using synchronized raw sparse LiDAR point clouds we define the space status and generate voxel-based occupancy labels. We formulate occupancy prediction as a simple classification problem and design associated occupancy losses. Resulting occupancy estimates are employed to enhance original frustum/3D features. As a result experiments on KITTI and Waymo open datasets demonstrate that the proposed method achieves a new state of the art and surpasses other methods by a significant margin."},

In this paper we propose Contextrast a contrastive learning-based semantic segmentation method that allows to capture local/global contexts and comprehend their relationships. Our proposed method comprises two parts: a) contextual contrastive learning (CCL) and b) boundary-aware negative (BANE) sampling. Contextual contrastive learning obtains local/global context from multi-scale feature aggregation and inter/intra-relationship of features for better discrimination capabilities. Meanwhile BANE sampling selects embedding features along the boundaries of incorrectly predicted regions to employ them as harder negative samples on our contrastive learning resolving segmentation issues along the boundary region by exploiting fine-grained details. We demonstrate that our Contextrast substantially enhances the performance of semantic segmentation networks outperforming state-of-the-art contrastive learning approaches on diverse public datasets e.g. Cityscapes CamVid PASCAL-C COCO-Stuff and ADE20K without an increase in computational cost during inference."},

This task is particularly challenging due to heavy occlusion rapid motion and the transitory nature of objects being hand-held where an object may be held released and subsequently picked up again. To tackle these challenges we have developed a novel transformer-based architecture called HOIST-Former. HOIST-Former is adept at spatially and temporally segmenting hands and objects by iteratively pooling features from each other ensuring that the processes of identification segmentation and tracking of hand-held objects depend on the hands' positions and their contextual appearance. We further refine HOIST-Former with a contact loss that focuses on areas where hands are in contact with objects. Moreover we also contribute an in-the-wild video dataset called HOIST which comprises 4125 videos complete with bounding boxes segmentation masks and tracking IDs for hand-held objects. Through experiments on the HOIST dataset and two additional public datasets we demonstrate the efficacy of HOIST-Former in segmenting and tracking hand-held objects."},

However our investigation reveals two limitations: ineffective feature learning from single modalities and overfitting to limited datasets. To address these issues this paper proposes a novel SSC framework - Adversarial Modality Modulation Network (AMMNet) - with a fresh perspective of optimizing gradient updates. The proposed AMMNet introduces two core modules: a cross-modal modulation enabling the interdependence of gradient flows between modalities and a customized adversarial training scheme leveraging dynamic gradient competition. Specifically the cross-modal modulation adaptively re-calibrates the features to better excite representation potentials from each single modality. The adversarial training employs a minimax game of evolving gradients with customized guidance to strengthen the generator's perception of visual fidelity from both geometric completeness and semantic correctness. Extensive experimental results demonstrate that AMMNet outperforms state-of-the-art SSC methods by a large margin providing a promising direction for improving the effectiveness and generalization of SSC methods."},

However existing gait recognition methods heavily rely on task-specific upstream driven by supervised learning to provide explicit gait representations like silhouette sequences which inevitably introduce expensive annotation costs and potential error accumulation. Escaping from this trend this work explores effective gait representations based on the all-purpose knowledge produced by task-agnostic Large Vision Models (LVMs) and proposes a simple yet efficient gait framework termed BigGait. Specifically the Gait Representation Extractor (GRE) within BigGait draws upon design principles from established gait representations effectively transforming all-purpose knowledge into implicit gait representations without requiring third-party supervision signals. Experiments on CCPG CAISA-B* and SUSTech1K indicate that BigGait significantly outperforms the previous methods in both within-domain and cross-domain tasks in most cases and provides a more practical paradigm for learning the next-generation gait representation.

Out-Of-Context (OOC) misinformation where authentic images are repurposed with false text is one of the easiest and most effective ways to mislead audiences. Current methods focus on assessing image-text consistency but lack convincing explanations for their judgments which are essential for debunking misinformation. While Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) have rich knowledge and innate capability for visual reasoning and explanation generation they still lack sophistication in understanding and discovering the subtle cross-modal differences. In this paper we introduce Sniffer a novel multimodal large language model specifically engineered for OOC misinformation detection and explanation. Sniffer employs two-stage instruction tuning on InstructBLIP. The first stage refines the model's concept alignment of generic objects with news-domain entities and the second stage leverages OOC-specific instruction data generated by language-only GPT-4 to fine-tune the model's discriminatory powers. Enhanced by external tools and retrieval Sniffer not only detects inconsistencies between text and image but also utilizes external knowledge for contextual verification. Our experiments show that Sniffer surpasses the original MLLM by over 40% and outperforms state-of-the-art methods in detection accuracy. Sniffer also provides accurate and persuasive explanations as validated by quantitative and human evaluations."},

The emergence of bio-inspired sensors known as event cameras which boast microsecond-level temporal resolution has ushered in a transformative era for VFI. Nonetheless the application of event-based VFI techniques in domains with distinct environments from the training data can be problematic. This is mainly because event camera data distribution can undergo substantial variations based on camera settings and scene conditions presenting challenges for effective adaptation. In this paper we propose a test-time adaptation method for event-based VFI to address the gap between the source and target domains. Our approach enables sequential learning in an online manner on the target domain which only provides low-frame-rate videos. We present an approach that leverages confident pixels as pseudo ground-truths enabling stable and accurate online learning from low-frame-rate videos.

The sampled latent texture maps are then decoded into a final texture map. During the sampling process we focus on both global and local consistency across multiple viewpoints: global consistency is achieved through the integration of style consistency mechanisms within the noise prediction network and low-level consistency is achieved by dynamically aligning latent textures.

In this work we rethink how to mitigate false matches from the perspective of image-to-image matching and propose a novel relation-aware intra-modal matching (RIM) framework for OVS based on visual foundation models. RIM achieves robust region classification by firstly constructing diverse image-modal reference features and then matching them with region features based on relation-aware ranking distribution. The proposed RIM enjoys several merits. First the intra-modal reference features are better aligned circumventing potential ambiguities that may arise in cross-modal matching. Second the ranking-based matching process harnesses the structure information implicit in the inter-class relationships making it more robust than comparing individually. Extensive experiments on three benchmarks demonstrate that RIM outperforms previous state-of-the-art methods by large margins obtaining a lead of more than 10% in mIoU on PASCAL VOC benchmark"},

In this paper we propose an efficient weakly supervised framework (Paraformer) to guide large-scale HR land-cover mapping with easy-access historical land-cover data of low resolution (LR). Specifically existing land-cover mapping approaches reveal the dominance of CNNs in preserving local ground details but still suffer from insufficient global modeling in various landforms. Therefore we design a parallel CNN-Transformer feature extractor in Paraformer consisting of a downsampling-free CNN branch and a Transformer branch to jointly capture local and global contextual information. Besides facing the spatial mismatch of training data a pseudo-label-assisted training (PLAT) module is adopted to reasonably refine LR labels for weakly supervised semantic segmentation of HR images. Experiments on two large-scale datasets demonstrate the superiority of Paraformer over other state-of-the-art methods for automatically updating HR land-cover maps from LR historical labels."},

Existing acceleration algorithms simplify the sampling by skipping most steps yet exhibit considerable performance degradation. By viewing the generation of diffusion models as a discretized integral process we argue that the quality drop is partly caused by applying an inaccurate integral direction to a timestep interval. To rectify this issue we propose a timestep tuner that helps find a more accurate integral direction for a particular interval at the minimum cost. Specifically at each denoising step we replace the original parameterization by conditioning the network on a new timestep enforcing the sampling distribution towards the real one. Extensive experiments show that our plug-in design can be trained efficiently and boost the inference performance of various state-of-the-art acceleration methods especially when there are few denoising steps. For example when using 10 denoising steps on LSUN Bedroom dataset we improve the FID of DDIM from 9.65 to 6.07 simply by adopting our method for a more appropriate set of timesteps.

To address these issues we propose a novel Hierarchical Prototype-guided Distribution Refinement (HPDR) framework to learn embedding in hyperbolic space which facilitates the hierarchical relation construction. We also collaborate with prototype learning for hierarchical distribution refinement in hyperbolic space. In detail we propose the Hierarchical Prototype Learning to simultaneously guide domain alignment and improve the discriminative ability via constraining the multi-level relations between prototypes and instances in hyperbolic space.

Our key observation is that object slicing is a more direct and hence more advantageous means to reveal occluded structures than altering camera views. Specifically slicing can peel through any occluder without obstruction and in the limit (i.e. with infinitely many slices) it is guaranteed to unveil all hidden object parts. We realize our idea by developing Slice3D a novel method for single-view 3D reconstruction which first predicts multi-slice images from a single RGB input image and then integrates the slices into a 3D model using a coordinate-based transformer network to product a signed distance function. The slice images can be regressed or generated both through a U-Net based network. For the former we inject a learnable slice indicator code to designate each decoded image into a spatial slice location while the slice generator is a denoising diffusion model operating on the entirety of slice images stacked on the input channels. We conduct extensive evaluation against state-of-the-art alternatives to demonstrate superiority of our method especially in recovering complex and severely occluded shape structures amid ambiguities. All Slice3D results were produced by networks trained on a single Nvidia A40 GPU with an inference time of less than 20 seconds."},

To achieve this a key challenge is to obtain a latent space that represents photorealistic image neural fields. We propose a simple and effective method inspired by several recent techniques but with key changes to make the image neural fields photorealistic.

In this light we advocate bolstering the discriminative abilities of T2I models to achieve more precise text-to-image alignment for generation. We present a discriminative adapter built on T2I models to probe their discriminative abilities on two representative tasks and leverage discriminative fine-tuning to improve their text-image alignment.

Besides it is usually time-consuming for them to generate elaborate 3D models with rich colors. In response this paper proposes GSGEN a novel method that adopts Gaussian Splatting a recent state-of-the-art representation to text-to-3D generation. GSGEN aims at generating high-quality 3D objects and addressing existing shortcomings by exploiting the explicit nature of Gaussian Splatting that enables the incorporation of 3D prior. Specifically our method adopts a progressive optimization strategy which includes a geometry optimization stage and an appearance refinement stage. In geometry optimization a coarse representation is established under 3D point cloud diffusion prior along with the ordinary 2D SDS optimization ensuring a sensible and 3D-consistent rough shape. Subsequently the obtained Gaussians undergo an iterative appearance refinement to enrich texture details. In this stage we increase the number of Gaussians by compactness-based densification to enhance continuity and improve fidelity. With these designs our approach can generate 3D assets with delicate details and accurate geometry.

We first quantify the FVD's sensitivity to the temporal axis by decoupling the frame and motion quality and find that the FVD only increases slightly with larger temporal corruption. We then analyze the generated videos and show that via careful sampling from a large set of generated videos that do not contain motions one can drastically decrease FVD without improving the temporal quality.

Recently vision language model (VLM)-based methods introduced the language prior by pre-training on large-scale pathological image-text pairs. However the previous text prompt lacks the consideration of pathological prior knowledge therefore does not substantially boost the model's performance. Moreover the collection of such pairs and the pre-training process are very time-consuming and source-intensive.

One such domain is Activities of Daily Living (ADL) where RGB alone is not sufficient to distinguish between visually similar actions or actions observed from multiple viewpoints. To facilitate the adoption of video transformers for ADL we hypothesize that the augmentation of RGB with human pose information known for its sensitivity to fine-grained motion and multiple viewpoints is essential. Consequently we introduce the first Pose Induced Video Transformer: PI-ViT (or π-ViT) a novel approach that augments the RGB representations learned by video transformers with 2D and 3D pose information. The key elements of π-ViT are two plug-in modules 2D Skeleton Induction Module and 3D Skeleton Induction Module that are responsible for inducing 2D and 3D pose information into the RGB representations. These modules operate by performing pose-aware auxiliary tasks a design choice that allows π-ViT to discard the modules during inference. Notably π-ViT achieves the state-of-the-art performance on three prominent ADL datasets encompassing both real-world and large-scale RGB-D datasets without requiring poses or additional computational overhead at inference."},

This paper presents an in-depth analysis of existing approaches in this domain highlighting a commonly overlooked aspect: the redundancy between view-consistent and view-specific representations. To this end we propose an innovative framework for multi-view representation learning which incorporates a technique we term 'distilled disentangling'. Our method introduces the concept of masked cross-view prediction enabling the extraction of compact high-quality view-consistent representations from various sources without incurring extra computational overhead. Additionally we develop a distilled disentangling module that efficiently filters out consistency-related information from multi-view representations resulting in purer view-specific representations. This approach significantly reduces redundancy between view-consistent and view-specific representations enhancing the overall efficiency of the learning process. Our empirical evaluations reveal that higher mask ratios substantially improve the quality of view-consistent representations. Moreover we find that reducing the dimensionality of view-consistent representations relative to that of view-specific representations further refines the quality of the combined representations."},

However conventional DUN aims to reconstruct all the missing information within the entire space in each iteration. Thus it could be challenging when dealing with highly ill-posed degradation often resulting in subpar reconstruction. In this work we propose a Progressive Divide-And-Conquer (PDAC) strategy aiming to break down the subsampling process in the actual severe degradation and thus perform reconstruction sequentially. Starting from decomposing the original maximum-a-posteriori problem of accelerated MRI we present a rigorous derivation of the proposed PDAC framework which could be further unfolded into an end-to-end trainable network. Each PDAC iteration specifically targets a distinct segment of moderate degradation based on the decomposition. Furthermore as part of the PDAC iteration such decomposition is adaptively learned as an auxiliary task through a degradation predictor which provides an estimation of the decomposed sampling mask. Following this prediction the sampling mask is further integrated via a severity conditioning module to ensure awareness of the degradation severity at each stage. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our proposed method achieves superior performance on the publicly available fastMRI and Stanford2D FSE datasets in both multi-coil and single-coil settings."},

Tacking-by-detection (TBD) trackers with Kalman Filter motion prediction work well in pedestrian-dominant scenarios but fall short in complex situations when multiple objects perform non-linear and diverse motion simultaneously. To tackle the complex non-linear motion we propose a real-time diffusion-based MOT approach named DiffMOT. Specifically for the motion predictor component we propose a novel Decoupled Diffusion-based Motion Predictor (D^2MP). It models the entire distribution of various motion presented by the data as a whole. It also predicts an individual object's motion conditioning on an individual's historical motion information. Furthermore it optimizes the diffusion process with much fewer sampling steps. As a MOT tracker the DiffMOT is real-time at 22.7FPS and also outperforms the state-of-the-art on DanceTrack and SportsMOT datasets with 62.3% and 76.2% in HOTA metrics respectively. To the best of our knowledge DiffMOT is the first to introduce a diffusion probabilistic model into the MOT to tackle non-linear motion prediction."},

However this can result in significant storage costs in practical applications as a separate model per task must be stored. To address this issue we present our pioneering work that enables parameter-efficient VTR using a pre-trained model with only a small number of tunable parameters during training. Towards this goal we propose a new method dubbed Multimodal Video Adapter (MV-Adapter) for efficiently transferring the knowledge in the pre-trained CLIP from image-text to video-text. Specifically MV-Adapter utilizes bottleneck structures in both video and text branches along with two novel components. The first is a Temporal Adaptation Module that is incorporated in the video branch to introduce global and local temporal contexts. We also train weights calibrations to adjust to dynamic variations across frames. The second is Cross Modality Tying that generates weights for video/text branches through sharing cross modality factors for better aligning between modalities. Thanks to above innovations MV-Adapter can achieve comparable or better performance than standard fine-tuning with negligible parameters overhead. Notably MV-Adapter consistently outperforms various competing methods in V2T/T2V tasks with large margins on five widely used VTR benchmarks (MSR-VTT MSVD LSMDC DiDemo and ActivityNet).

The quality of queried data is crucial yet obtaining a large amount of real data for MS is often challenging. Recent works have reduced reliance on real data by using generative models. However when high-dimensional query data is required these methods are impractical due to the high costs of querying and the risk of model collapse. In this work we propose using sample gradients (SG) to enhance the utility of each real sample as SG provides crucial guidance on the decision boundaries of the victim model. However utilizing SG in the model stealing scenario faces two challenges: 1. Pixel-level gradient estimation requires extensive query volume and is susceptible to defenses. 2. The estimation of sample gradients has a significant variance. This paper proposes Superpixel Sample Gradient stealing (SPSG) for model stealing under the constraint of limited real samples. With the basic idea of imitating the victim model's low-variance patch-level gradients instead of pixel-level gradients SPSG achieves efficient sample gradient estimation through two steps. First we perform patch-wise perturbations on query images to estimate the average gradient in different regions of the image. Then we filter the gradients through a threshold strategy to reduce variance. Exhaustive experiments demonstrate that with the same number of real samples SPSG achieves accuracy agreements and adversarial success rate significantly surpassing the current state-of-the-art MS methods.

However their reliance on web-scale data of varied quality often yields results that are visually unappealing and misaligned with the textual prompts. To tackle this problem we propose InstructVideo to instruct text-to-video diffusion models with human feedback by reward fine-tuning. InstructVideo has two key ingredients: 1) To ameliorate the cost of reward fine-tuning induced by generating through the full DDIM sampling chain we recast reward fine-tuning as editing. By leveraging the diffusion process to corrupt a sampled video InstructVideo requires only partial inference of the DDIM sampling chain reducing fine-tuning cost while improving fine-tuning efficiency. 2) To mitigate the absence of a dedicated video reward model for human preferences we repurpose established image reward models e.g. HPSv2. To this end we propose Segmental Video Reward a mechanism to provide reward signals based on segmental sparse sampling and Temporally Attenuated Reward a method that mitigates temporal modeling degradation during fine-tuning. Extensive experiments both qualitative and quantitative validate the practicality and efficacy of using image reward models in InstructVideo significantly enhancing the visual quality of generated videos without compromising generalization capabilities.

In this paper we propose DiffEditor to rectify two weaknesses in existing diffusion-based image editing: (1) in complex scenarios editing results often lack editing accuracy and exhibit unexpected artifacts; (2) lack of flexibility to harmonize editing operations e.g. imagine new content. In our solution we introduce image prompts in fine-grained image editing cooperating with the text prompt to better describe the editing content. To increase the flexibility while maintaining content consistency we locally combine stochastic differential equation (SDE) into the ordinary differential equation (ODE) sampling. In addition we incorporate regional score-based gradient guidance and a time travel strategy into the diffusion sampling further improving the editing quality. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our method can efficiently achieve state-of-the-art performance on various fine-grained image editing tasks including editing within a single image (e.g. object moving resizing and content dragging) and across images (e.g. appearance replacing and object pasting).

First we propose a new future-class awareness mechanism by separating some potential regions for future classes from background based on their similarities to both old and new classes in the representation space. With this mechanism we can not only reserve more parameter space for future updates but also enhance the representation capability of learned features. We further propose an innovative compatibility-inspired distillation scheme to make our model take full advantage of the knowledge learned by the old model.

In contrast to previous fast reconstruction methods that represent the 3D scene globally we model the light field of a scene as a set of local light field feature probes parameterized with position and multi-channel 2D feature maps. Our central idea is to bake the scene's light field into spatially varying learnable representations and to query point features by weighted blending of probes close to the camera - allowing for mipmap representation and rendering. We introduce a novel vector-matrix-matrix (VMM) factorization technique that effectively represents the light field feature probes as products of core factors (i.e. VM) shared among local feature probes and a basis factor (i.e. M) - efficiently encoding internal relationships and patterns within the scene.Experimentally we demonstrate that NeLF-Pro significantly boosts the performance of feature grid-based representations and achieves fast reconstruction with better rendering quality while maintaining compact modeling.

Without complex architecture modification or costly training DiffPerformer finetunes a pretrained diffusion model on a single video of the target character and introduces an implicit video representation as a proxy to learn temporally consistent guidance for the diffusion model. The guidance is encoded into VAE latent space and an iterative optimization loop is constructed between the implicit video representation and the diffusion model allowing to harness the smooth property of the implicit video representation and the generative capabilities of the diffusion model in a mutually beneficial way. Moreover we propose 3D-aware human flow as a temporal constraint during the optimization to explicitly model the correspondence between driving poses and human appearance. This alleviates the misalignment between guided poses and target performer and therefore maintains the appearance coherence under various motions.

{"title": "NAPGuard: Towards Detecting Naturalistic Adversarial Patches", "authors": "Siyang Wu, Jiakai Wang, Jiejie Zhao, Yazhe Wang, Xianglong Liu", "abstract": "Recently the emergence of naturalistic adversarial patch (NAP) which possesses a deceptive appearance and various representations underscores the necessity of developing robust detection strategies. However existing approaches fail to differentiate the deep-seated natures in adversarial patches i.e. aggressiveness and naturalness leading to unsatisfactory precision and generalization against NAPs. To tackle this issue we propose NAPGuard to provide strong detection capability against NAPs via the elaborated critical feature modulation framework. For improving precision we propose the aggressive feature aligned learning to enhance the model's capability in capturing accurate aggressive patterns. Considering the challenge of inaccurate model learning caused by deceptive appearance we align the aggressive features by the proposed pattern alignment loss during training. Since the model could learn more accurate aggressive patterns it is able to detect deceptive patches more precisely. To enhance generalization we design the natural feature suppressed inference to universally mitigate the disturbance from different NAPs. Since various representations arise in diverse disturbing forms to hinder generalization we suppress the natural features in a unified approach via the feature shield module. Therefore the models could recognize NAPs within less disturbance and activate the generalized detection ability. Extensive experiments show that our method surpasses state-of-the-art methods by large margins in detecting NAPs (improve 60.24% AP@0.5 on average)."},

Our method is able to during test-time optimization jointly fuse a burst image capture into one high-resolution reconstruction and decompose it into transmission and obstruction layers. Then by discarding the obstruction layer we can perform a range of tasks including seeing through occlusions reflection suppression and shadow removal.

Current works depend on inaccessible paired training samples for the person where two aligned frames exhibit the same speech content yet differ in emotional expression limiting the SPFEM applications in real-world scenarios. In this work we discover that speakers who convey the same content with different emotions exhibit highly correlated local facial animations providing valuable supervision for SPFEM. To capitalize on this insight we propose a novel adaptive spatial coherent correlation learning (ASCCL) algorithm which models the aforementioned correlation as an explicit metric and integrates the metric to supervise manipulating facial expression and meanwhile better preserving the facial animation of spoken contents. To this end it first learns a spatial coherent correlation metric ensuring the visual disparities of adjacent local regions of the image belonging to one emotion are similar to those of the corresponding counterpart of the image belonging to another emotion. Recognizing that visual disparities are not uniform across all regions we have also crafted a disparity-aware adaptive strategy that prioritizes regions that present greater challenges. During SPFEM model training we construct the adaptive spatial coherent correlation metric between corresponding local regions of the input and output images as addition loss to supervise the generation process. We conduct extensive experiments on variant datasets and the results demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed ASCCL algorithm.

Among these a notable method is Textual Inversion which generates personalized images by inverting given images into textual embeddings. However methods based on Textual Inversion still struggle with balancing the trade-off between reconstruction quality and editability. In this study we examine this issue through the lens of initialization. Upon closely examining traditional initialization methods we identified a significant disparity between the initial and learned embeddings in terms of both scale and orientation. The scale of the learned embedding can be up to 100 times greater than that of the initial embedding. Such a significant change in the embedding could increase the risk of overfitting thereby compromising the editability. Driven by this observation we introduce a novel initialization method termed Cross Initialization that significantly narrows the gap between the initial and learned embeddings. This method not only improves both reconstruction and editability but also reduces the optimization steps from 5000 to 320. Furthermore we apply a regularization term to keep the learned embedding close to the initial embedding. We show that when combined with Cross Initialization this regularization term can effectively improve editability. We provide comprehensive empirical evidence to demonstrate the superior performance of our method compared to the baseline methods. Notably in our experiments Cross Initialization is the only method that successfully edits an individual's facial expression. Additionally a fast version of our method allows for capturing an input image in roughly 26 seconds while surpassing the baseline methods in terms of both reconstruction and editability.

To overcome these difficulties we propose DanceCamera3D a transformer-based diffusion model that incorporates a novel body attention loss and a condition separation strategy. For evaluation we devise new metrics measuring camera movement quality diversity and dancer fidelity. Utilizing these metrics we conduct extensive experiments on our DCM dataset providing both quantitative and qualitative evidence showcasing the effectiveness of our DanceCamera3D model.

However understanding fine-grained visual-linguistic concepts such as attributes and inter-object relationships remains a significant challenge. While several benchmarks aim to evaluate VLMs in finer granularity their primary focus remains on the linguistic aspect neglecting the visual dimension. Here we highlight the importance of evaluating VLMs from both a textual and visual perspective. We introduce a progressive pipeline to synthesize images that vary in a specific attribute while ensuring consistency in all other aspects. Utilizing this data engine we carefully design a benchmark SPEC to diagnose the comprehension of object size position existence and count. Subsequently we conduct a thorough evaluation of four leading VLMs on SPEC. Surprisingly their performance is close to random guess revealing significant limitations. With this in mind we propose a simple yet effective approach to optimize VLMs in fine-grained understanding achieving significant improvements on SPEC without compromising the zero-shot performance. Results on two additional fine-grained benchmarks also show consistent improvements further validating the transferability of our approach.

Black, Sergi Pujades", "abstract": "The creation of personalized anatomical digital twins is important in the fields of medicine computer graphics sports science and biomechanics. To observe a subject's anatomy expensive medical devices (MRI or CT) are required and the creation of the digital model is often time-consuming and involves manual effort. Instead we leverage the fact that the shape of the body surface is correlated with the internal anatomy; e.g. from surface observations alone one can predict body composition and skeletal structure. In this work we go further and learn to infer the 3D location of three important anatomic tissues: subcutaneous adipose tissue (fat) lean tissue (muscles and organs) and long bones. To learn to infer these tissues we tackle several key challenges. We first create a dataset of human tissues by segmenting full-body MRI scans and registering the SMPL body mesh to the body surface. With this dataset we train HIT (Human Implicit Tissues) an implicit function that given a point inside a body predicts its tissue class. HIT leverages the SMPL body model shape and pose parameters to canonicalize the medical data. Unlike SMPL which is trained from upright 3D scans MRI scans are acquired with subjects lying on a table resulting in significant soft-tissue deformation. Consequently HIT uses a learned volumetric deformation field that undoes these deformations. Since HIT is parameterized by SMPL we can repose bodies or change the shape of subjects and the internal structures deform appropriately. We perform extensive experiments to validate HIT's ability to predict a plausible internal structure for novel subjects. The dataset and HIT model are available at https://hit.is.tue.mpg.de to foster future research in this direction."},

Most existing methods predominantly focus on single latent type such as point or grid latents. In contrast the proposed DITTO leverages both point and grid latents (i.e. dual latent) to enhance their strengths the stability of grid latents and the detail-rich capability of point latents. Concretely DITTO consists of dual latent encoder and integrated implicit decoder. In the dual latent encoder a dual latent layer which is the key module block composing the encoder refines both latents in parallel maintaining their distinct shapes and enabling recursive interaction. Notably a newly proposed dynamic sparse point transformer within the dual latent layer effectively refines point latents. Then the integrated implicit decoder systematically combines these refined latents achieving high-fidelity 3D reconstruction and surpassing previous state-of-the-art methods on object- and scene-level datasets especially in thin and detailed structures."},

Current approaches in dense optical flow estimators excel in providing spatially dense tracking but are limited to short temporal spans. Conversely recent advancements in long-range trackers offer extended temporal coverage but at the cost of spatial sparsity. This paper introduces FlowTrack a novel framework designed to bridge this gap. FlowTrack combines the strengths of both paradigms by 1) chaining confident flow predictions to maximize efficiency and 2) automatically switching to an error compensation module in instances of flow prediction inaccuracies. This dual strategy not only offers efficient dense tracking over extended temporal spans but also ensures robustness against error accumulations and occlusions common pitfalls of naive flow chaining. Furthermore we demonstrate that chained flow itself can serve as an effective guide for an error compensation module even for occluded points. Our framework achieves state-of-the-art accuracy for long-range tracking on the DAVIS dataset and renders 50% speed-up when performing dense tracking."},

In practice most existing RGB trackers learn a single set of parameters to use them across datasets and applications. However a similar single-model unification for multi-modality tracking presents several challenges. These challenges stem from the inherent heterogeneity of inputs -- each with modality-specific representations the scarcity of multi-modal datasets and the absence of all the modalities at all times. In this work we introduce Un-Track a Unified Tracker of a single set of parameters for any modality. To handle any modality our method learns their common latent space through low-rank factorization and reconstruction techniques. More importantly we use only the RGB-X pairs to learn the common latent space. This unique shared representation seamlessly binds all modalities together enabling effective unification and accommodating any missing modality all within a single transformer-based architecture. Our Un-Track achieves +8.1 absolute F-score gain on the DepthTrack dataset by introducing only +2.14 (over 21.50) GFLOPs with +6.6M (over 93M) parameters through a simple yet efficient prompting strategy.

ALGM merges tokens in two stages: (1) In the first network layer it merges similar tokens within a small local window and (2) halfway through the network it merges similar tokens across the entire image. This is motivated by an analysis in which we found that in those situations tokens with a high cosine similarity can likely be merged without a drop in segmentation quality. With extensive experiments across multiple datasets and network configurations we show that ALGM not only significantly improves the throughput by up to 100% but can also enhance the mean IoU by up to +1.1 thereby achieving a better trade-off between segmentation quality and efficiency than existing methods. Moreover our approach is adaptive during inference meaning that the same model can be used for optimal efficiency or accuracy depending on the application.

Low-latency and high-quality interactive segmentation with diverse prompts remain challenging for existing specialist and generalist models. Specialist models with their limited prompts and task-specific designs experience high latency because the image must be recomputed every time the prompt is updated due to the joint encoding of image and visual prompts. Generalist models exemplified by the Segment Anything Model (SAM) have recently excelled in prompt diversity and efficiency lifting image segmentation to the foundation model era. However for high-quality segmentations SAM still lags behind state-of-the-art specialist models despite SAM being trained with x100 more segmentation masks. In this work we delve deep into the architectural differences between the two types of models. We observe that dense representation and fusion of visual prompts are the key design choices contributing to the high segmentation quality of specialist models. In light of this we reintroduce this dense design into the generalist models to facilitate the development of generalist models with high segmentation quality. To densely represent diverse visual prompts we propose to use a dense map to capture five types: clicks boxes polygons scribbles and masks. Thus we propose SegNext a next-generation interactive segmentation approach offering low latency high quality and diverse prompt support. Our method outperforms current state-of-the-art methods on HQSeg-44K and DAVIS quantitatively and qualitatively."},

In this paper we propose HumanRef a 3D human generation framework from a single-view input. To ensure the generated 3D model is photorealistic and consistent with the input image HumanRef introduces a novel method called reference-guided score distillation sampling (Ref-SDS) which effectively incorporates image guidance into the generation process.

While the primary focus of deepfake detection has traditionally centered on the design of detection algorithms an investigative inquiry into the generator architectures has remained conspicuously absent in recent years. This paper contributes to this lacuna by rethinking the architectures of CNN-based generator thereby establishing a generalized representation of synthetic artifacts. Our findings illuminate that the up-sampling operator can beyond frequency-based artifacts produce generalized forgery artifacts. In particular the local interdependence among image pixels caused by upsampling operators is significantly demonstrated in synthetic images generated by GAN or diffusion. Building upon this observation we introduce the concept of Neighboring Pixel Relationships(NPR) as a means to capture and characterize the generalized structural artifacts stemming from up-sampling operations. A comprehensive analysis is conducted on an open-world dataset comprising samples generated by 28 distinct generative models. This analysis culminates in the establishment of a novel state-of-the-art performance showcasing a remarkable 12.8% improvement over existing methods.

AvatarGPT treats each task as one type of instruction fine-tuned on the shared LLM. All the tasks are seamlessly interconnected with language as the universal interface constituting a closed-loop within the framework. To achieve this human motion sequences are first encoded as discrete tokens which serve as the extended vocabulary of LLM.

While previous works mostly generate structural human skeletons resulting in the omission of appearance information we focus on the direct generation of audio-driven co-speech gesture videos in this work. There are two main challenges: 1) A suitable motion feature is needed to describe complex human movements with crucial appearance information. 2) Gestures and speech exhibit inherent dependencies and should be temporally aligned even of arbitrary length. To solve these problems we present a novel motion-decoupled framework to generate co-speech gesture videos. Specifically we first introduce a well-designed nonlinear TPS transformation to obtain latent motion features preserving essential appearance information. Then a transformer-based diffusion model is proposed to learn the temporal correlation between gestures and speech and performs generation in the latent motion space followed by an optimal motion selection module to produce long-term coherent and consistent gesture videos.

However the use of large-scale datasets scraped from the web for training also makes these models vulnerable to potential security threats such as backdooring and poisoning attacks. In this paper we propose a method for mitigating such attacks on contrastively trained vision-language models. Our approach leverages external knowledge extracted from a language model to prevent models from learning correlations between image regions which lack strong alignment with external knowledge. We do this by imposing constraints to enforce that attention paid by the model to visual regions is proportional to the alignment of those regions with external knowledge. We conduct extensive experiments using a variety of recent backdooring and poisoning attacks on multiple datasets and architectures. Our results clearly demonstrate that our proposed approach is highly effective at defending against such attacks across multiple settings while maintaining model utility and without requiring any changes at inference time."},

Early research focused on fully fine-tuning RGB-based trackers which was inefficient and lacked generalized representation due to the scarcity of multimodal data. Therefore recent studies have utilized prompt tuning to transfer pre-trained RGB-based trackers to multimodal data. However the modality gap limits pre-trained knowledge recall and the dominance of the RGB modality persists preventing the full utilization of information from other modalities. To address these issues we propose a novel symmetric multimodal tracking framework called SDSTrack. We introduce lightweight adaptation for efficient fine-tuning which directly transfers the feature extraction ability from RGB to other domains with a small number of trainable parameters and integrates multimodal features in a balanced symmetric manner. Furthermore we design a complementary masked patch distillation strategy to enhance the robustness of trackers in complex environments such as extreme weather poor imaging and sensor failure.

These methods operate either through post-analysis or by integrating concept learning during model training. Although being effective in bridging the semantic gap between a model's latent space and human interpretation these explanation methods only partially reveal the model's decision-making process. The outcome is typically limited to high-level semantics derived from the last feature map. We argue that the explanations lacking insights into the decision processes at low and mid-level features are neither fully faithful nor useful. Addressing this gap we introduce the Multi-Level Concept Prototypes Classifier (MCPNet) an inherently interpretable model. MCPNet autonomously learns meaningful concept prototypes across multiple feature map levels using Centered Kernel Alignment (CKA) loss and an energy-based weighted PCA mechanism and it does so without reliance on predefined concept labels. Further we propose a novel classifier paradigm that learns and aligns multi-level concept prototype distributions for classification purposes via Class-aware Concept Distribution (CCD) loss. Our experiments reveal that our proposed MCPNet while being adaptable to various model architectures offers comprehensive multi-level explanations while maintaining classification accuracy. Additionally its concept distribution-based classification approach shows improved generalization capabilities in few-shot classification scenarios."},

To solve above problems we propose DS-NeRV which decomposes videos into sparse learnable static codes and dynamic codes without the need for explicit optical flow or residual supervision. By setting different sampling rates for two codes and applying weighted sum and interpolation sampling methods DS-NeRV efficiently utilizes redundant static information while maintaining high-frequency details.

However establishing such an ideal framework that is both task-generic and label-efficient poses a challenge in unifying the representation of the same primitive across diverse scenes. The current contrastive 3D pre-training methods typically follow a frame-level consistency which focuses on the 2D-3D relationships in each detached image. Such inconsiderate consistency greatly hampers the promising path of reaching an universal pre-training framework: (1) The cross-scene semantic self-conflict  \\textit i.e.  the intense collision between primitive segments of the same semantics from different scenes; (2) Lacking a globally unified bond that pushes the cross-scene semantic consistency into 3D representation learning. To address above challenges we propose a CSC framework that puts a scene-level semantic consistency in the heart bridging the connection of the similar semantic segments across various scenes. To achieve this goal we combine the coherent semantic cues provided by the vision foundation model and the knowledge-rich cross-scene prototypes derived from the complementary multi-modality information. These allow us to train a universal 3D pre-training model that facilitates various downstream tasks with less fine-tuning efforts. Empirically we achieve consistent improvements over SOTA pre-training approaches in semantic segmentation (+1.4% mIoU) object detection (+1.0% mAP) and panoptic segmentation (+3.0% PQ) using their task-specific 3D network on nuScenes.

A common approach to induce sparsity-based structures into gradient-based saliency maps is to modify the simple gradient scheme using sparsification or norm-based regularization. However one drawback with such post-processing approaches is the potentially significant loss in fidelity to the original simple gradient map. In this work we propose to apply adversarial training as an in-processing scheme to train neural networks with structured simple gradient maps. We demonstrate an existing duality between the regularized norms of the adversarial perturbations and gradient-based maps whereby we design adversarial training schemes promoting sparsity and group-sparsity properties in simple gradient maps.

Severe self-occlusion and out-of-view limbs in egocentric camera views make accurate pose estimation a challenging problem. To address the challenge prior methods employ joint heatmaps-probabilistic 2D representations of the body pose but heatmap-to-3D pose conversion still remains an inaccurate process. We propose a novel heatmap-to-3D lifting method composed of the Grid ViT Encoder and the Propagation Network. The Grid ViT Encoder summarizes joint heatmaps into effective feature embedding using self-attention. Then the Propagation Network estimates the 3D pose by utilizing skeletal information to better estimate the position of obscure joints. Our method significantly outperforms the previous state-of-the-art qualitatively and quantitatively demonstrated by a 23.9% reduction of error in an MPJPE metric.

In this system we introduce hierarchical semantic representation to allow multi-level semantic comprehension for top-down structured semantic mapping of the scene. In addition to fully utilize the correlation between multiple attributes of the environment we integrate appearance geometry and semantic features through cross-attention for feature collaboration. This strategy enables a more multifaceted understanding of the environment thereby allowing SNI-SLAM to remain robust even when single attribute is defective. Then we design an internal fusion-based decoder to obtain semantic RGB Truncated Signed Distance Field (TSDF) values from multi-level features for accurate decoding. Furthermore we propose a feature loss to update the scene representation at the feature level. Compared with low-level losses such as RGB loss and depth loss our feature loss is capable of guiding the network optimization on a higher-level. Our SNI-SLAM method demonstrates superior performance over all recent NeRF-based SLAM methods in terms of mapping and tracking accuracy on Replica and ScanNet datasets while also showing excellent capabilities in accurate semantic segmentation and real-time semantic mapping.

Existing high-performing 3D object detectors usually build dense feature maps in the backbone network and prediction head. However the computational costs introduced by the dense feature maps grow quadratically as the perception range increases making these models hard to scale up to long-range detection. Some recent works have attempted to construct fully sparse detectors to solve this issue; nevertheless the resulting models either rely on a complex multi-stage pipeline or exhibit inferior performance. In this work we propose a fully sparse adaptive feature diffusion network (SAFDNet) for LiDAR-based 3D object detection. In SAFDNet an adaptive feature diffusion strategy is designed to address the center feature missing problem. We conducted extensive experiments on Waymo Open nuScenes and Argoverse2 datasets. SAFDNet performed slightly better than the previous SOTA on the first two datasets but much better on the last dataset which features long-range detection verifying the efficacy of SAFDNet in scenarios where long-range detection is required. Notably on Argoverse2 SAFDNet surpassed the previous best hybrid detector HEDNet by 2.6% mAP while being 2.1x faster and yielded 2.1% mAP gains over the previous best sparse detector FSDv2 while being 1.3x faster.

This paper jointly handles the challenges from sparse inputs and reflective surfaces by leveraging polarized images. We derive photometric and geometric cues from the polarimetric image formation model and multiview azimuth consistency which jointly optimize the surface geometry modeled via implicit neural representation.

In this paper we visualize the internal feature maps to analyze how the network densifies the input sparse depth. We find that the encoder feature of ED-Net focus on the areas with input depth points around. To obtain a dense feature and thus estimate complete depth the decoder feature tends to complement and enhance the encoder feature by skip-connection to make the fused encoder-decoder feature dense resulting in the decoder feature also exhibits sparse. However ED-Net obtains the sparse decoder feature from the dense fused feature at the previous stage where the \"dense to sparse\" process destroys the completeness of features and loses information. To address this issue we present a depth feature upsampling network (DFU) that explicitly utilizes these dense features to guide the upsampling of a low-resolution (LR) depth feature to a high-resolution (HR) one. The completeness of features is maintained throughout the upsampling process thus avoiding information loss. Furthermore we propose a confidence-aware guidance module (CGM) which is confidence-aware and performs guidance with adaptive receptive fields (GARF) to fully exploit the potential of these dense features as guidance. Experimental results show that our DFU a plug-and-play module can significantly improve the performance of existing ED-Net based methods with limited computational overheads and new SOTA results are achieved. Besides the generalization capability on sparser depth is also enhanced. Project page: https://npucvr.github.io/DFU."},

In this paper we present and delve into the self-consistency capability of LVLMs a crucial aspect that reflects the models' ability to both generate informative captions for specific objects and subsequently utilize these captions to accurately re-identify the objects in a closed-loop process. This capability significantly mirrors the precision and reliability of fine-grained visual-language understanding. Our findings reveal that the self-consistency level of existing LVLMs falls short of expectations posing limitations on their practical applicability and potential. To address this gap we introduce a novel fine-tuning paradigm named Self-Consistency Tuning (SC-Tune). It features the synergistic learning of a cyclic describer-locator system. This paradigm is not only data-efficient but also exhibits generalizability across multiple LVLMs. Through extensive experiments we demonstrate that SC-Tune significantly elevates performance across a spectrum of object-level vision-language benchmarks and maintains competitive or improved performance on image-level vision-language benchmarks.

Depending on the input modility tracking tasks can be divided into RGB tracking and RGB+X (e.g. RGB+N and RGB+D) tracking.

Based on this common ground we present a general framework to unify various tracking tasks termed as OneTracker. OneTracker first performs a large-scale pre-training on a RGB tracker called Foundation Tracker. This pretraining phase equips the Foundation Tracker with a stable ability to estimate the location of the target object. Then we regard other modality information as prompt and build Prompt Tracker upon Foundation Tracker. Through freezing the Foundation Tracker and only adjusting some additional trainable parameters Prompt Tracker inhibits the strong localization ability from Foundation Tracker and achieves parameter-efficient finetuning on downstream RGB+X tracking tasks. To evaluate the effectiveness of our general framework OneTracker which is consisted of Foundation Tracker and Prompt Tracker we conduct extensive experiments on 6 popular tracking tasks across 11 benchmarks and our OneTracker outperforms other models and achieves state-of-the-art performance."},

These breakthroughs aim to produce more realistic animatable avatars narrowing the gap between virtual and real-world experiences. Most of existing works employ Score Distillation Sampling (SDS) loss combined with a differentiable renderer and text condition to guide a diffusion model in generating 3D avatars. However SDS often generates over-smoothed results with few facial details thereby lacking the diversity compared with ancestral sampling. On the other hand other works generate 3D avatar from a single image where the challenges of unwanted lighting effects perspective views and inferior image quality make them difficult to reliably reconstruct the 3D face meshes with the aligned complete textures. In this paper we propose a novel 3D avatar generation approach termed UltrAvatar with enhanced fidelity of geometry and superior quality of physically based rendering (PBR) textures without unwanted lighting. To this end the proposed approach presents a diffuse color extraction model and an authenticity guided texture diffusion model. The former removes the unwanted lighting effects to reveal true diffuse colors so that the generated avatars can be rendered under various lighting conditions. The latter follows two gradient-based guidances for generating PBR textures to render diverse face-identity features and details better aligning with 3D mesh geometry.

In this work we propose WaveFace to solve the problems in the frequency domain where low- and high-frequency components decomposed by wavelet transformation are considered individually to maximize authenticity as well as efficiency. The diffusion model is applied to recover the low-frequency component only which presents general information of the original image but 1/16 in size. To preserve the original identity the generation is conditioned on the low-frequency component of low-quality images at each denoising step. Meanwhile high-frequency components at multiple decomposition levels are handled by a unified network which recovers complex facial details in a single step. Evaluations on four benchmark datasets show that: 1) WaveFace outperforms state-of-the-art methods in authenticity especially in terms of identity preservation and 2) authentic images are restored with the efficiency 10x faster than existing diffusion model-based BFR methods."},

Recent research has primarily focused on consistency regularization techniques exploring perturbation-invariant training at both the image and feature levels. In this work we proposed a novel feature-level consistency learning framework named Density-Descending Feature Perturbation (DDFP). Inspired by the low-density separation assumption in semi-supervised learning our key insight is that feature density can shed a light on the most promising direction for the segmentation classifier to explore which is the regions with lower density. We propose to shift features with confident predictions towards lower-density regions by perturbation injection. The perturbed features are then supervised by the predictions on the original features thereby compelling the classifier to explore less dense regions to effectively regularize the decision boundary. Central to our method is the estimation of feature density. To this end we introduce a lightweight density estimator based on normalizing flow allowing for efficient capture of the feature density distribution in an online manner. By extracting gradients from the density estimator we can determine the direction towards less dense regions for each feature.

With the proposed AV2AV two key advantages can be brought: 1) We can perform real-like conversations with individuals worldwide in a virtual meeting by utilizing our own primary languages. In contrast to Speech-to-Speech Translation (A2A) which solely translates between audio modalities the proposed AV2AV directly translates between audio-visual speech. This capability enhances the dialogue experience by presenting synchronized lip movements along with the translated speech. 2) We can improve the robustness of the spoken language translation system. By employing the complementary information of audio-visual speech the system can effectively translate spoken language even in the presence of acoustic noise showcasing robust performance. To mitigate the problem of the absence of a parallel AV2AV translation dataset we propose to train our spoken language translation system with the audio-only dataset of A2A.

With the framework we conduct a large suite of experiments offering various insights in choosing the INRs and geometric rendering functions: for example the dense feature grid outperforms other INRs (e.g. tri-plane and hash grid) even when geometric and color features are jointly encoded for memory efficiency. To extend the findings into the practical scenario a hybrid encoding strategy is proposed to bring the best of the accuracy and completion from the grid-based and decomposition-based INRs.

Such a bi-mask search strategy is further used together with a proposed adaptive one-hot loss to realize the progressive-and-efficient search for the most important subnet. Finally Progressive Masked Image Modeling (PMIM) is proposed to regularize the feature space to be more representative during the search process which may be degraded by the dimension reduction. Extensive experiments demonstrate that OFB can achieve superior compression performance over state-of-the-art searching-based and pruning-based methods under various Vision Transformer architectures meanwhile promoting search efficiency significantly e.g. costing one GPU search day for the compression of DeiT-S on ImageNet-1K."},

This work presents M3Net a one-of-a-kind framework for fulfilling multi-task multi-dataset multi-modality LiDAR segmentation in a universal manner using just a single set of parameters. To better exploit data volume and diversity we first combine large-scale driving datasets acquired by different types of sensors from diverse scenes and then conduct alignments in three spaces namely data feature and label spaces during the training. As a result M3Net is capable of taming heterogeneous data for training state-of-the-art LiDAR segmentation models.

{"title": "Hierarchical Histogram Threshold Segmentation - Auto-terminating High-detail Oversegmentation", "authors": "Thomas V. Chang, Simon Seibt, Bartosz von Rymon Lipinski", "abstract": "Superpixels play a crucial role in image processing by partitioning an image into clusters of pixels with similar visual attributes. This facilitates subsequent image processing tasks offering computational advantages over the manipulation of individual pixels. While numerous oversegmentation techniques have emerged in recent years many rely on predefined initialization and termination criteria. In this paper a novel top-down superpixel segmentation algorithm called Hierarchical Histogram Threshold Segmentation (HHTS) is introduced. It eliminates the need for initialization and implements auto-termination outperforming state-of-the-art methods w.r.t boundary recall. This is achieved by iteratively partitioning individual pixel segments into foreground and background and applying intensity thresholding across multiple color channels. The underlying iterative process constructs a superpixel hierarchy that adapts to local detail distributions until color information exhaustion. Experimental results demonstrate the superiority of the proposed approach in terms of boundary adherence while maintaining competitive runtime performance on the BSDS500 and NYUV2 datasets. Furthermore an application of HHTS in refining machine learning-based semantic segmentation masks produced by the Segment Anything Foundation Model (SAM) is presented."},

It generates 3D instance properties stored in an unordered object set and retrieves the most similar geometry for each object configuration which is characterized as a concatenation of different attributes including location size orientation semantics and geometry features. We introduce a diffusion network to synthesize a collection of 3D indoor objects by denoising a set of unordered object attributes. Unordered parametrization simplifies and eases the joint distribution approximation. The shape feature diffusion facilitates natural object placements including symmetries. Our method enables many downstream applications including scene completion scene arrangement and text-conditioned scene synthesis. Experiments on the 3D-FRONT dataset show that our method can synthesize more physically plausible and diverse indoor scenes than state-of-the-art methods.

However existing methods for video-sound generation attempt to directly create sound from visual representations which can be challenging due to the difficulty of aligning visual representations with audio representations. In this paper we present SonicVisionLM a novel framework aimed at generating a wide range of sound effects by leveraging vision-language models(VLMs). Instead of generating audio directly from video we use the capabilities of powerful VLMs. When provided with a silent video our approach first identifies events within the video using a VLM to suggest possible sounds that match the video content. This shift in approach transforms the challenging task of aligning image and audio into more well-studied sub-problems of aligning image-to-text and text-to-audio through the popular diffusion models. To improve the quality of audio recommendations with LLMs we have collected an extensive dataset that maps text descriptions to specific sound effects and developed a time-controlled audio adapter. Our approach surpasses current state-of-the-art methods for converting video to audio enhancing synchronization with the visuals and improving alignment between audio and video components.

We also introduce various user-point interactions (e.g. removing points and dragging points) to address various semantic point correspondence.

Danesh, Li Fuxin", "abstract": "Despite extensive research on training generative adversarial networks (GANs) with limited training data learning to generate images from long-tailed training distributions remains fairly unexplored. In the presence of imbalanced multi-class training data GANs tend to favor classes with more samples leading to the generation of low quality and less diverse samples in tail classes. In this study we aim to improve the training of class-conditional GANs with long-tailed data. We propose a straightforward yet effective method for knowledge sharing allowing tail classes to borrow from the rich information from classes with more abundant training data. More concretely we propose modifications to existing class-conditional GAN architectures to ensure that the lower-resolution layers of the generator are trained entirely unconditionally while reserving class-conditional generation for the higher-resolution layers. Experiments on several long-tail benchmarks and GAN architectures demonstrate a significant improvement over existing methods in both the diversity and fidelity of the generated images.

Class activation maps (CAMs) and recent variants provide ways to visually explain the DNN decision-making process by displaying 'attention' heatmaps of the DNNs. Nevertheless the CAM explanation only offers relative attention information that is on an attention heatmap we can interpret which image region is more or less important than the others. However these regions cannot be meaningfully compared across classes and the contribution of each region to the model's class prediction is not revealed. To address these challenges that ultimately lead to better DNN Interpretation in this paper we propose CAPE a novel reformulation of CAM that provides a unified and probabilistically meaningful assessment of the contributions of image regions. We quantitatively and qualitatively compare CAPE with state-of-the-art CAM methods on CUB and ImageNet benchmark datasets to demonstrate enhanced interpretability.

Given their potential considerable efforts have been invested to improve their performance. Nonetheless the essential question of selecting training views is yet to be thoroughly investigated. This key aspect plays a vital role in achieving high-quality results and aligns with the well-known tenet of deep learning: \"garbage in garbage out\". In this paper we first illustrate the importance of view selection by demonstrating how a simple rotation of the test views within the most pervasive NeRF dataset can lead to consequential shifts in the performance rankings of state-of-the-art techniques. To address this challenge we introduce a unified framework for view selection methods and devise a thorough benchmark to assess its impact. Significant improvements can be achieved without leveraging error or uncertainty estimation but focusing on uniform view coverage of the reconstructed object resulting in a training-free approach. Using this technique we show that high-quality renderings can be achieved faster by using fewer views. We conduct extensive experiments on both synthetic datasets and realistic data to demonstrate the effectiveness of our proposed method compared with random conventional error-based and uncertainty-guided view selection."},
{"title": "Robust Emotion Recognition in Context Debiasing", "authors": "Dingkang Yang, Kun Yang, Mingcheng Li, Shunli Wang, Shuaibing Wang, Lihua Zhang", "abstract": "Context-aware emotion recognition (CAER) has recently boosted the practical applications of affective computing techniques in unconstrained environments. Mainstream CAER methods invariably extract ensemble representations from diverse contexts and subject-centred characteristics to perceive the target person's emotional state. Despite advancements the biggest challenge remains due to context bias interference. The harmful bias forces the models to rely on spurious correlations between background contexts and emotion labels in likelihood estimation causing severe performance bottlenecks and confounding valuable context priors. In this paper we propose a counterfactual emotion inference (CLEF) framework to address the above issue. Specifically we first formulate a generalized causal graph to decouple the causal relationships among the variables in CAER. Following the causal graph CLEF introduces a non-invasive context branch to capture the adverse direct effect caused by the context bias. During the inference we eliminate the direct context effect from the total causal effect by comparing factual and counterfactual outcomes resulting in bias mitigation and robust prediction. As a model-agnostic framework CLEF can be readily integrated into existing methods bringing consistent performance gains."},

Given a pre-captured 3D map our approach localizes a panorama image taking advantage of the holistic 360 degree view. The system mitigates potential privacy breaches or domain discrepancies by avoiding trained or hand-crafted visual descriptors. However as lines alone can be ambiguous we express distinctive yet compact spatial contexts from relationships between lines namely the dominant directions of parallel lines and the intersection between non-parallel lines. The resulting representations are efficient in processing time and memory compared to conventional visual descriptor-based methods. Given the groups of dominant line directions and their intersections we accelerate the search process to test thousands of pose candidates in less than a millisecond without sacrificing accuracy. We empirically show that the proposed 2D-3D matching can localize panoramas for challenging scenes with similar structures dramatic domain shifts or illumination changes. Our fully geometric approach does not involve extensive parameter tuning or neural network training making it a practical algorithm that can be readily deployed in the real world.

However mitigating visual biases is challenging due to their unexplainable nature often identified indirectly through visualization or sample statistics which necessitates additional human supervision for interpretation. To tackle this issue we propose the Bias-to-Text (B2T) framework which interprets visual biases as keywords. Specifically we extract common keywords from the captions of mispredicted images to identify potential biases in the model. We then validate these keywords by measuring their similarity to the mispredicted images using a vision-language scoring model. The keyword explanation form of visual bias offers several advantages such as a clear group naming for bias discovery and a natural extension for debiasing using these group names. Our experiments demonstrate that B2T can identify known biases such as gender bias in CelebA background bias in Waterbirds and distribution shifts in ImageNet-R/C. Additionally B2T uncovers novel biases in larger datasets such as Dollar Street and ImageNet. For example we discovered a contextual bias between \\keyword bee  and \\keyword flower  in ImageNet. We also highlight various applications of B2T keywords including debiased training CLIP prompting and model comparison."},

Discerning set-level differences is crucial for understanding model behaviors and analyzing datasets yet manually sifting through thousands of images is impractical. To aid in this discovery process we explore the task of automatically describing the differences between two sets of images which we term Set Difference Captioning. This task takes in image sets \\mathcal D _A and \\mathcal D _B and outputs a description that is more often true on \\mathcal D _A than \\mathcal D _B. We outline a two-stage approach that first proposes candidate difference descriptions from image sets and then re-ranks the candidates by checking how well they can differentiate the two sets. We introduce VisDiff which first captions the images and prompts a language model to propose candidate descriptions then re-ranks these descriptions using CLIP. To evaluate VisDiff we collect VisDiffBench a dataset with 187 paired image sets with ground truth difference descriptions. We apply VisDiff to various domains such as comparing datasets (e.g. ImageNet vs. ImageNetV2) comparing classification models (e.g. zero-shot CLIP vs. supervised ResNet) characterizing differences between generative models (e.g. StableDiffusionV1 and V2) and discovering what makes images memorable.

In the first stage to better encode the shape and positional information of strokes we propose to predict an extra dense distance field in an autoencoder network to reinforce structural information learning. In the second stage we treat an entire stroke as a single entity and label a group of strokes within the same semantic part using an autoregressive Transformer with the default attention mechanism. By group-based labeling our method can fully leverage the context information when making decisions for the remaining groups of strokes. Our method achieves the best segmentation accuracy compared with state-of-the-art approaches on two representative datasets and has been extensively evaluated demonstrating its superior performance.

It is difficult to appropriately re-balance the classifiers in SSL because the class distribution of an unlabeled set is often unknown and could be mismatched with that of a labeled set. We propose a novel class-imbalanced SSL algorithm called class-distribution-mismatch-aware debiasing (CDMAD). For each iteration of training CDMAD first assesses the classifier's biased degree towards each class by calculating the logits on an image without any patterns (e.g. solid color image) which can be considered irrelevant to the training set. CDMAD then refines biased pseudo-labels of the base SSL algorithm by ensuring the classifier's neutrality. CDMAD uses these refined pseudo-labels during the training of the base SSL algorithm to improve the quality of the representations. In the test phase CDMAD similarly refines biased class predictions on test samples. CDMAD can be seen as an extension of post-hoc logit adjustment to address a challenge of incorporating the unknown class distribution of the unlabeled set for re-balancing the biased classifier under class distribution mismatch. CDMAD ensures Fisher consistency for the balanced error. Extensive experiments verify the effectiveness of CDMAD."},

This difficulty arises because the two-view relative translation computed by traditional geometric vision methods e.g. the five-point algorithm is scaleless. Many researchers have proposed diverse translation averaging methods to solve this problem. Instead of solving the problem in the motion averaging phase we focus on estimating scaled relative pose with the help of panoramic cameras and deep neural networks. In this paper a novel network namely PanoPose is proposed to estimate the relative motion in a fully self-supervised manner and a global SfM pipeline is built for panorama images. The proposed PanoPose comprises a depth-net and a pose-net with self-supervision achieved by reconstructing the reference image from its neighboring images based on the estimated depth and relative pose. To maintain precise pose estimation under large viewing angle differences we randomly rotate the panoramic images and pre-train the pose-net with images before and after the rotation. To enhance scale accuracy a fusion block is introduced to incorporate depth information into pose estimation. Extensive experiments on panoramic SfM datasets demonstrate the effectiveness of PanoPose compared with state-of-the-arts."},

ZePT disentangles the object queries into two subsets and trains them in two stages. Initially it learns a set of fundamental queries for organ segmentation through an object-aware feature grouping strategy which gathers organ-level visual features. Subsequently it refines the other set of advanced queries that focus on the auto-generated visual prompts for unseen tumor segmentation.

A concurrent work DragDiffusion updates the diffusion latent map in response to user inputs causing global latent map alterations. This results in imprecise preservation of the original content and unsuccessful editing due to gradient vanishing. In contrast we present DragNoise offering robust and accelerated editing without retracing the latent map. The core rationale of DragNoise lies in utilizing the predicted noise output of each U-Net as a semantic editor. This approach is grounded in two critical observations: firstly the bottleneck features of U-Net inherently possess semantically rich features ideal for interactive editing; secondly high-level semantics established early in the denoising process show minimal variation in subsequent stages. Leveraging these insights DragNoise edits diffusion semantics in a single denoising step and efficiently propagates these changes ensuring stability and efficiency in diffusion editing. Comparative experiments reveal that DragNoise achieves superior control and semantic retention reducing the optimization time by over 50% compared to DragDiffusion.

The primary bottlenecks include 1) the time-consuming nature of the inversion process; 2) the struggle to balance consistency with accuracy; 3) the lack of compatibility with efficient consistency sampling methods used in consistency models. To address the above issues we start by asking ourselves if the inversion process can be eliminated for editing. We show that when the initial sample is known a special variance schedule reduces the denoising step to the same form as the multi-step consistency sampling. We name this Denoising Diffusion Consistent Model (DDCM) and note that it implies a virtual inversion strategy without explicit inversion in sampling. We further unify the attention control mechanisms in a tuning-free framework for text-guided editing. Combining them we present inversion-free editing (InfEdit) which allows for consistent and faithful editing for both rigid and non-rigid semantic changes catering to intricate modifications without compromising on the image's integrity and explicit inversion.

Specifically taking inspiration from knowledge distillation in model compression we propose a new asymmetric masked distillation (AMD) framework for pre-training relatively small models with autoencoding. The core of AMD is to devise an asymmetric masking strategy where the teacher model is enabled to see more context information with a lower masking ratio while the student model is still equipped with a high masking ratio. We design customized multi-layer feature alignment between the teacher encoder and student encoder to regularize the pre-training of student MAE. To demonstrate the effectiveness and versatility of AMD we apply it to both ImageMAE and VideoMAE for pre-training relatively small ViT models. AMD achieved 84.6% classification accuracy on IN1K using the ViT-B model. And AMD achieves 73.3% classification accuracy using the ViT-B model on the Something-in-Something V2 dataset a 3.7% improvement over the original ViT-B model from VideoMAE.

Inspired by the great success of diffusion model in image generation tasks we propose a novel hierarchical framework named as CoTDiffusion that incorporates diffusion model as a high-level planner to convert the general and multi-modal prompts into coherent visual subgoal plans which further guide the low-level policy model before action execution. We design a semantic alignment module that can anchor the progress of generated keyframes along a coherent generation chain unlocking the chain-of-thought reasoning ability of diffusion model. Additionally we propose bi-directional generation and frame concat mechanism to further enhance the fidelity of generated subgoal images and the accuracy of instruction following. The experiments cover various robotics manipulation scenarios including visual reasoning visual rearrange and visual constraints. CoTDiffusion achieves outstanding performance gain compared to the baselines without explicit subgoal generation which proves that a subgoal image is worth a thousand words of instruction."},

However in real-world scenarios massive multimodal data are harvested from the Internet which inevitably contains Partially Mismatched Pairs (PMPs). Undoubtedly such semantical irrelevant data will remarkably harm the cross-modal retrieval performance. Previous efforts tend to mitigate this problem by estimating a soft correspondence to down-weight the contribution of PMPs. In this paper we aim to address this challenge from a new perspective: the potential semantic similarity among unpaired samples makes it possible to excavate useful knowledge from mismatched pairs. To achieve this we propose L2RM a general framework based on Optimal Transport (OT) that learns to rematch mismatched pairs. In detail L2RM aims to generate refined alignments by seeking a minimal-cost transport plan across different modalities. To formalize the rematching idea in OT first we propose a self-supervised cost function that automatically learns from explicit similarity-cost mapping relation. Second we present to model a partial OT problem while restricting the transport among false positives to further boost refined alignments. Extensive experiments on three benchmarks demonstrate our L2RM significantly improves the robustness against PMPs for existing models. The code is available at https://github.com/hhc1997/L2RM."},

However without sufficient semantic comments and structure such programs can be challenging to understand let alone modify. We introduce the problem of semantic commenting CAD programs wherein the goal is to segment the input program into code blocks corresponding to semantically meaningful shape parts and assign a semantic label to each block. We solve the problem by combining program parsing with visual-semantic analysis afforded by recent advances in foundational language and vision models. Specifically by executing the input programs we create shapes which we use to generate conditional photorealistic images to make use of semantic annotators for such images. We then distill the information across the images and link back to the original programs to semantically comment on them. Additionally we collected and annotated a benchmark dataset CADTalk consisting of 5288 machine-made programs and 45 human-made programs with ground truth semantic comments.

It can be quantified by formal verification by providing a certified lower bound within which any perturbation does not alter the original input's classification result. It is challenging due to nonlinear components such as MaxPool. At present many verification methods are sound but risk losing some precision to enhance efficiency and scalability and thus a certified lower bound is a crucial criterion for evaluating the performance of verification tools. In this paper we present MaxLin a robustness verifier for MaxPool-based CNNs with tight Linear approximation. By tightening the linear approximation of the MaxPool function we can certify larger certified lower bounds of CNNs. We evaluate MaxLin with open-sourced benchmarks including LeNet and networks trained on the MNIST CIFAR-10 and Tiny ImageNet datasets. The results show that MaxLin outperforms state-of-the-art tools with up to 110.60% improvement regarding the certified lower bound and 5.13 X speedup for the same neural networks.

Considering the extensive scale of LLM and visual backbone minimal GPU memory is left for facilitating effective temporal modeling which is crucial for comprehending and providing feedback on videos. To this end we propose Branching Temporal Adapter (BT-Adapter) a novel method for extending image-language pretrained models into the video domain. Specifically BT-Adapter serves as a plug-and-use temporal modeling branch alongside the pretrained visual encoder which is tuned while keeping the backbone frozen. Just pretrained once BT-Adapter can be seamlessly integrated into all image conversation models using this version of CLIP enabling video conversations without the need for video instructions. Besides we develop a unique asymmetric token masking strategy inside the branch with tailor-made training tasks for BT-Adapter facilitating faster convergence and better results. Thanks to BT-Adapter we are able to empower existing multimodal dialogue models with strong video understanding capabilities without incurring excessive GPU costs. Without bells and whistles BT-Adapter achieves (1) state-of-the-art zero-shot results on various video tasks using thousands of fewer GPU hours.

We achieve this goal by training an additional network to control the frozen upgraded model with the new text-image data pairs. In detail X-Adapter keeps a frozen copy of the old model to preserve the connectors of different plugins. Additionally X-Adapter adds trainable mapping layers that bridge the decoders from models of different versions for feature remapping. The remapped features will be used as guidance for the upgraded model. To enhance the guidance ability of X-Adapter we employ a -text training strategy for the upgraded model. After training we also introduce a two-stage denoising strategy to align the initial latents of X-Adapter and the upgraded model.

Since it is hard to annotate event data previous approaches rely on event-to-image reconstruction to obtain pseudo labels for training. However this will inevitably introduce noise and learning from noisy pseudo labels especially when generated from a single source may reinforce the errors. This drawback is also called confirmation bias in pseudo-labeling. In this paper we propose a novel hybrid pseudo-labeling framework for unsupervised event-based semantic segmentation HPL-ESS to alleviate the influence of noisy pseudo labels. In particular we first employ a plain unsupervised domain adaptation framework as our baseline which can generate a set of pseudo labels through self-training. Then we incorporate offline event-to-image reconstruction into the framework and obtain another set of pseudo labels by predicting segmentation maps on the reconstructed images. A noisy label learning strategy is designed to mix the two sets of pseudo labels and enhance the quality. Moreover we propose a soft prototypical alignment module to further improve the consistency of target domain features. Extensive experiments show that our proposed method outperforms existing state-of-the-art methods by a large margin on the DSEC-Semantic dataset (+5.88% accuracy +10.32% mIoU) which even surpasses several supervised methods."},

The hierarchical structure of explanatory factors hidden in data is such a general representation and could be potentially achieved with a hierarchical VAE. However training a hierarchical VAE always suffers from the \"posterior collapse\" where the data information is hard to propagate to the higher-level latent variables hence resulting in a bad hierarchical representation. To address this issue we first analyze the shortcomings of existing methods for mitigating the \"posterior collapse\" from an information theory perspective then highlight the necessity of regularization for explicitly propagating data information to higher-level latent variables while maintaining the dependency between different levels. This naturally leads to formulating the inference of the hierarchical latent representation as a sequential decision process which could benefit from applying reinforcement learning (RL). Aligning RL's objective with the regularization we first introduce a \"skip-generative path\" to acquire a reward for evaluating the information content of an inferred latent representation and then the developed Q-value function based on it could have a consistent optimization direction of the regularization. Finally policy gradient one of the typical RL methods is employed to train a hierarchical VAE without introducing a gradient estimator. Experimental results firmly support our analysis and demonstrate that our proposed method effectively mitigates the \"posterior collapse\" issue learns an informative hierarchy acquires explainable latent representations and significantly outperforms other hierarchical VAE-based methods in downstream tasks."},

Recently there exist some methods exploring fusing multiple modalities within a single field aiming to share implicit features from different modalities to enhance reconstruction performance. However these modalities often exhibit misaligned behaviors: optimizing for one modality such as LiDAR can adversely affect another like camera performance and vice versa. In this work we conduct comprehensive analyses on the multimodal implicit field of LiDAR-camera joint synthesis revealing the underlying issue lies in the misalignment of different sensors. Furthermore we introduce AlignMiF a geometrically aligned multimodal implicit field with two proposed modules: Geometry-Aware Alignment (GAA) and Shared Geometry Initialization (SGI). These modules effectively align the coarse geometry across different modalities significantly enhancing the fusion process between LiDAR and camera data. Through extensive experiments across various datasets and scenes we demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach in facilitating better interaction between LiDAR and camera modalities within a unified neural field. Specifically our proposed AlignMiF achieves remarkable improvement over recent implicit fusion methods (+2.01 and +3.11 image PSNR on the KITTI-360 and Waymo datasets) and consistently surpasses single modality performance (13.8% and 14.2% reduction in LiDAR Chamfer Distance on the respective datasets)."},

Real-world hyperspectral images (HSIs) bearing wide spectral characteristics are particularly valuable. However the acquisition of HSIs is always costly and time-intensive resulting in a severe data-thirsty issue in HSI research and applications. Current solutions have not been able to generate a sufficient volume of diverse and reliable synthetic HSIs. To this end our study formulates a novel generalized paradigm for HSI synthesis i.e. unmixing before fusion that initiates with unmixing across multi-source data and follows by fusion-based synthesis. By integrating unmixing this work maps unpaired HSI and RGB data to a low-dimensional abundance space greatly alleviating the difficulty of generating high-dimensional samples. Moreover incorporating abundances inferred from unpaired RGB images into generative models allows for cost-effective supplementation of various realistic spatial distributions in abundance synthesis. Our proposed paradigm can be instrumental with a series of deep generative models filling a significant gap in the field and enabling the generation of vast high-quality HSI samples for large-scale downstream tasks.

To harness visual concepts from target images without prompt engineering current approaches largely rely on embedding inversion by optimizing and then mapping them to pseudo-tokens. However working with such high-dimensional vector representations is challenging because they lack semantics and interpretability and only allow simple vector operations when using them. Instead this work focuses on inverting the diffusion model to obtain interpretable language prompts directly. The challenge of doing this lies in the fact that the resulting optimization problem is fundamentally discrete and the space of prompts is exponentially large; this makes using standard optimization techniques such as stochastic gradient descent difficult. To this end we utilize a delayed projection scheme to optimize for prompts representative of the vocabulary space in the model. Further we leverage the findings that different timesteps of the diffusion process cater to different levels of detail in an image. The later noisy timesteps of the forward diffusion process correspond to the semantic information and therefore prompt inversion in this range provides tokens representative of the image semantics. We show that our approach can identify semantically interpretable and meaningful prompts for a target image which can be used to synthesize diverse images with similar content. We further illustrate the application of the optimized prompts in evolutionary image generation and concept removal."},

NR-IQA models play a crucial role in the media industry aiding in performance evaluation and optimization guidance. However these models are found to be vulnerable to adversarial attacks which introduce imperceptible perturbations to input images resulting in significant changes in predicted scores. In this paper we propose a defense method to mitigate the variability in predicted scores caused by small perturbations thus enhancing the adversarial robustness of NR-IQA models. To be specific we present theoretical evidence showing that the extent of score changes is related to the l_1 norm of the gradient of the predicted score with respect to the input image when adversarial perturbations are l_inf-bounded. Building on this theoretical foundation we propose a norm regularization training strategy aimed at reducing the l_1 norm of the gradient thereby boosting the adversarial robustness of NR-IQA models. Experiments conducted on four NR-IQA baseline models demonstrate the effectiveness of our strategy in reducing score changes in the presence of adversarial attacks. To the best of our knowledge this work marks the first attempt to defend against adversarial attacks on NR-IQA models. Our study offers valuable insights into the adversarial robustness of NR-IQA models and provides a foundation for future research in this area."},

Current 3D GAN architectures however typically rely on volume representations which are slow to render thereby hampering the GAN training and requiring multi-view-inconsistent 2D upsamplers. Here we introduce Gaussian Shell Maps (GSMs) as a framework that connects SOTA generator network architectures with emerging 3D Gaussian rendering primitives using an articulable multi shell--based scaffold. In this setting a CNN generates a 3D texture stack with features that are mapped to the shells. The latter represent inflated and deflated versions of a template surface of a digital human in a canonical body pose. Instead of rasterizing the shells directly we sample 3D Gaussians on the shells whose attributes are encoded in the texture features. These Gaussians are efficiently and differentiably rendered. The ability to articulate the shells is important during GAN training and at inference time to deform a body into arbitrary user-defined poses. Our efficient rendering scheme bypasses the need for view-inconsistent upsamplers and achieves high-quality multi-view consistent renderings at a native resolution of 512 x512 pixels. We demonstrate that GSMs successfully generate 3D humans when trained on single-view datasets including SHHQ and DeepFashion."},

Previous research consistently highlights the potential privacy breaches in SL systems by server adversaries reconstructing training data. However these studies often rely on strong assumptions or compromise system utility to enhance attack performance. This paper introduces a new semi-honest Data Reconstruction Attack on SL named Feature-Oriented Reconstruction Attack (FORA). In contrast to prior works FORA relies on limited prior knowledge specifically that the server utilizes auxiliary samples from the public without knowing any client's private information. This allows FORA to conduct the attack stealthily and achieve robust performance. The key vulnerability exploited by FORA is the revelation of the model representation preference in the smashed data output by victim client. FORA constructs a substitute client through feature-level transfer learning aiming to closely mimic the victim client's representation preference. Leveraging this substitute client the server trains the attack model to effectively reconstruct private data. Extensive experiments showcase FORA's superior performance compared to state-of-the-art methods.

However is polarization-based vision vulnerable to adversarial attacks? If so is that possible to realize these adversarial attacks in the physical world without being perceived by human eyes? In this paper we warn the community of the vulnerability of polarization-based vision which can be more serious than RGB-based vision. By adapting a commercial LCD projector we achieve locally controllable polarizing projection which is successfully utilized to fool state-of-the-art polarization-based vision algorithms for glass segmentation and SfP. Compared with existing physical attacks on RGB-based vision which always suffer from the trade-off between attack efficacy and eye conceivability the adversarial attackers based on polarizing projection are contact-free and visually imperceptible since naked human eyes can rarely perceive the difference of viciously manipulated polarizing light and ordinary illumination. This poses unprecedented risks on polarization-based vision for which due attentions should be paid and counter measures be considered."},

We first utilize a detector pre-trained on limited labels to produce pseudo ground truth on unlabeled events. Then the detector is re-trained with both real and generated labels. Leveraging the temporal consistency of events we run bi-directional inference and apply tracking-based post-processing to enhance the quality of pseudo labels. To stabilize training against label noise we further design a soft anchor assignment strategy. We introduce new experimental protocols to evaluate the task of label-efficient event-based detection on Gen1 and 1Mpx datasets. LEOD consistently outperforms supervised baselines across various labeling ratios. For example on Gen1 it improves mAP by 8.6% and 7.8% for RVT-S trained with 1% and 2% labels.

In this work we aim to rethink the diffusion model-based IR models through a different perspective i.e. a deep equilibrium (DEQ) fixed point system called DeqIR. Specifically we derive an analytical solution by modeling the entire sampling chain in these IR models as a joint multivariate fixed point system. Based on the analytical solution we can conduct parallel sampling and restore HQ images without training. Furthermore we compute fast gradients via DEQ inversion and found that initialization optimization can boost image quality and control the generation direction. Extensive experiments on benchmarks demonstrate the effectiveness of our method on typical IR tasks and real-world settings."},

However few studies have considered the characteristics of nighttime hazy scenes. There are two distinctions between nighttime and daytime haze. First there may be multiple active colored light sources with lower illumination intensity in nighttime scenes which may cause haze glow and noise with localized coupled and frequency inconsistent characteristics. Second due to the domain discrepancy between simulated and real-world data unrealistic brightness may occur when applying a dehazing model trained on simulated data to real-world data. To address the above two issues we propose a semi-supervised model for real-world nighttime dehazing. First the spatial attention and frequency spectrum filtering are implemented as a spatial-frequency domain information interaction module to handle the first issue. Second a pseudo-label-based retraining strategy and a local window-based brightness loss for semi-supervised training process is designed to suppress haze and glow while achieving realistic brightness. Experiments on public benchmarks validate the effectiveness of the proposed method and its superiority over state-of-the-art methods.

Existing methods commonly avoid relying on private data by utilizing synthetic or sampled data. However a long-overlooked issue is that the severe distribution shifts between their substitution and original data which manifests as huge differences in the quality of images and class proportions. The harmful shifts are essentially the confounder that significantly causes performance bottlenecks. To tackle the issue this paper proposes a novel perspective with causal inference to disentangle the student models from the impact of such shifts. By designing a customized causal graph we first reveal the causalities among the variables in the DFKD task. Subsequently we propose a Knowledge Distillation Causal Intervention (KDCI) framework based on the backdoor adjustment to de-confound the confounder. KDCI can be flexibly combined with most existing state-of-the-art baselines. Experiments in combination with six representative DFKD methods demonstrate the effectiveness of our KDCI which can obviously help existing methods under almost all settings e.g. improving the baseline by up to 15.54% accuracy on the CIFAR-100 dataset."},

However existing VPG approaches are heavily reliant on a considerable number of temporal labels that are laborious and time-consuming to acquire. In this work we introduce and explore Weakly-Supervised Video Paragraph Grounding (WSVPG) to eliminate the need of temporal annotations. Different from previous weakly-supervised grounding frameworks based on multiple instance learning or reconstruction learning for two-stage candidate ranking we propose a novel siamese learning framework that jointly learns the cross-modal feature alignment and temporal coordinate regression without timestamp labels to achieve concise one-stage localization for WSVPG. Specifically we devise a Siamese Grounding TRansformer (SiamGTR) consisting of two weight-sharing branches for learning complementary supervision. An Augmentation Branch is utilized for directly regressing the temporal boundaries of a complete paragraph within a pseudo video and an Inference Branch is designed to capture the order-guided feature correspondence for localizing multiple sentences in a normal video. We demonstrate by extensive experiments that our paradigm has superior practicability and flexibility to achieve efficient weakly-supervised or semi-supervised learning outperforming state-of-the-art methods trained with the same or stronger supervision."},

Previous researches mainly focus on improving adversarial robustness in the fully supervised setting leaving the challenging domain of zero-shot adversarial robustness an open question. In this work we investigate this domain by leveraging the recent advances in large vision-language models such as CLIP to introduce zero-shot adversarial robustness to DNNs. We propose LAAT a Language-driven Anchor-based Adversarial Training strategy. LAAT utilizes the features of a text encoder for each category as fixed anchors (normalized feature embeddings) for each category which are then employed for adversarial training. By leveraging the semantic consistency of the text encoders LAAT aims to enhance the adversarial robustness of the image model on novel categories. However naively using text encoders leads to poor results. Through analysis we identified the issue to be the high cosine similarity between text encoders. We then design an expansion algorithm and an alignment cross-entropy loss to alleviate the problem. Our experimental results demonstrated that LAAT significantly improves zero-shot adversarial robustness over state-of-the-art methods. LAAT has the potential to enhance adversarial robustness by large-scale multimodal models especially when labeled data is unavailable during training."},

To address this shortcoming we introduce novel data-adaptive designs for each of the ViT modules that break shift-equivariance such as tokenization self-attention patch merging and positional encoding. With our proposed modules we achieve perfect circular shift-equivariance across four prominent ViT architectures: Swin SwinV2 CvT and MViTv2. Additionally we leverage our design to further enhance consistency under standard shifts. We evaluate our adaptive ViT models on image classification and semantic segmentation tasks. Our models achieve competitive performance across three diverse datasets showcasing perfect (100%) circular shift consistency while improving standard shift consistency."},

Our approach leverages NeRF's multi-view consistency to establish robust self-supervision effectively eliminating erroneous measurements and uncovering coherent structures within exceedingly noisy input amidst diverse real-world illumination scenarios. The framework comprises two core elements: a spike generation model incorporating an integrate-and-fire neuron layer and parameters accounting for non-idealities such as threshold variation and a spike rendering loss capable of generalizing across varying illumination conditions. We describe how to effectively optimize neural radiance fields to render photorealistic novel views from the novel continuous spike stream demonstrating advantages over other vision sensors in certain scenes.

Despite the latest advancements in camera hardware the mobile camera sensor area cannot be increased significantly due to physical constraints leading to a pixel size of 0.6--2.0 \\mum which results in strong image noise even in moderate lighting conditions. In the era of deep learning one can train a CNN model to perform robust image denoising. However there is still a lack of a substantially diverse dataset for this task. To address this problem we introduce a novel Mobile Image Denoising Dataset (MIDD) comprising over 400000 noisy / noise-free image pairs captured under various conditions by 20 different mobile camera sensors. Additionally we propose a new DPreview test set consisting of data from 294 different cameras for precise model evaluation. Furthermore we present the efficient baseline model SplitterNet for the considered mobile image denoising task that achieves high numerical and visual results while being able to process 8MP photos directly on smartphone GPUs in under one second. Thereby outperforming models with similar runtimes. This model is also compatible with recent mobile NPUs demonstrating an even higher speed when deployed on them.

Post-training quantization (PTQ) can improve inference efficiency through integer computing. However they suffer from severe performance degradation when performing full quantization due to overlooking the unique characteristics of regression tasks in object detection. In this paper we are the first to explore regression-friendly quantization and conduct full quantization on various detectors. We reveal the intrinsic reason behind the difficulty of quantizing regressors with empirical and theoretical justifications and introduce a novel Regression-specialized Post-Training Quantization (Reg-PTQ) scheme. It includes Filtered Global Loss Integration Calibration to combine the global loss with a two-step filtering mechanism mitigating the adverse impact of false positive bounding boxes and Learnable Logarithmic-Affine Quantizer tailored for the non-uniform distributed parameters in regression structures.

When recognizing an individual's identity existing methods primarily rely on appearance which can be influenced by the background environment due to a lack of body shape awareness. Although some methods attempt to incorporate other modalities such as gait or body shape they encode the additional modality separately resulting in extra computational costs and lacking an inherent connection with appearance. In this paper we explore the use of implicit 3-D body shape representations as pixel-level guidance to augment the extraction of identity features with body shape knowledge in addition to appearance. Using body shape as supervision rather than as input provides shape-aware enhancements without any increase in computational cost and delivers coherent integration with pixel-wise appearance features. Moreover for video-based person re-identification we align pixel-level features across frames with shape awareness to ensure temporal consistency. Our results demonstrate that incorporating body shape as pixel-level supervision reduces rank-1 errors by 1.4% for frame-based and by 2.5% for video-based re-identification tasks respectively and can also be generalized to other existing appearance-based person re-identification methods."},

Although efforts have been made to improve few-shot ability of CLIP key factors on the effectiveness of existing methods have not been well studied limiting further exploration of CLIP's potential in few-shot learning. In this paper we first introduce a unified formulation to analyze CLIP-based few-shot learning methods from a perspective of logit bias which encourages us to learn an effective logit bias for further improving performance of CLIP-based few-shot learning methods. To this end we disassemble three key components involved in computation of logit bias (i.e. logit features logit predictor and logit fusion) and empirically analyze the effect on performance of few-shot classification. Based on analysis of key components this paper proposes a novel AMU-Tuning method to learn effective logit bias for CLIP-based few-shot classification. Specifically our AMU-Tuning predicts logit bias by exploiting the appropriate Auxiliary features which are fed into an efficient feature-initialized linear classifier with Multi-branch training. Finally an Uncertainty-based fusion is developed to incorporate logit bias into CLIP for few-shot classification. The experiments are conducted on several widely used benchmarks and the results show AMU-Tuning clearly outperforms its counterparts while achieving state-of-the-art performance of CLIP-based few-shot learning without bells and whistles."},

SfM is a classic computer vision problem that is solved though iterative minimization of reprojection errors referred to as Bundle Adjustment (BA) starting from a good initialization. In order to obtain a good enough initialization to BA conventional methods rely on a sequence of sub-problems (such as pairwise pose estimation pose averaging or triangulation) which provide an initial solution that can then be refined using BA. In this work we replace these sub-problems by learning a model that takes as input the 2D keypoints detected across multiple views and outputs the corresponding camera poses and 3D keypoint coordinates. Our model takes advantage of graph neural networks to learn SfM-specific primitives and we show that it can be used for fast inference of the reconstruction for new and unseen sequences. The experimental results show that the proposed model outperforms competing learning-based methods and challenges COLMAP while having lower runtime.

Under this setting the model can perceive tasks from prompts and accomplish them without any extra task-specific head predictions or model fine-tuning. However skeleton sequence modeling via in-context learning remains unexplored. Directly applying existing in-context models from other areas onto skeleton sequences fails due to the similarity between inter-frame and cross-task poses which makes it exceptionally hard to perceive the task correctly from a subtle context. To address this challenge we propose Skeleton-in-Context (SiC) an effective framework for in-context skeleton sequence modeling. Our SiC is able to handle multiple skeleton-based tasks simultaneously after a single training process and accomplish each task from context according to the given prompt. It can further generalize to new unseen tasks according to customized prompts. To facilitate context perception we additionally propose a task-unified prompt which adaptively learns tasks of different natures such as partial joint-level generation sequence-level prediction or 2D-to-3D motion prediction.

Black, Justus Thies", "abstract": "We present HAAR a new strand-based generative model for 3D human hairstyles. Specifically based on textual inputs HAAR produces 3D hairstyles that could be used as production-level assets in modern computer graphics engines. Current AI-based generative models take advantage of powerful 2D priors to reconstruct 3D content in the form of point clouds meshes or volumetric functions. However by using the 2D priors they are intrinsically limited to only recovering the visual parts. Highly occluded hair structures can not be reconstructed with those methods and they only model the \"outer shell\" which is not ready to be used in physics-based rendering or simulation pipelines. In contrast we propose a first text-guided generative method that uses 3D hair strands as an underlying representation. Leveraging 2D visual question-answering (VQA) systems we automatically annotate synthetic hair models that are generated from a small set of artist-created hairstyles. This allows us to train a latent diffusion model that operates in a common hairstyle UV space. In qualitative and quantitative studies we demonstrate the capabilities of the proposed model and compare it to existing hairstyle generation approaches.

Thereby the similarity of all segmentation tasks and the implicit relationship between them have not been utilized effectively.

The model named OneFormer3D performs instance and semantic segmentation consistently using a group of learnable kernels where each kernel is responsible for generating a mask for either an instance or a semantic category. These kernels are trained with a transformer-based decoder with unified instance and semantic queries passed as an input. Such a design enables training a model end-to-end in a single run so that it achieves top performance on all three segmentation tasks simultaneously. Specifically our OneFormer3D ranks 1st and sets a new state-of-the-art (+2.1 mAP50) in the ScanNet test leaderboard.

We believe that - to effectively transfer such an holistic perception to intelligent machines - an important role is played by learning to correlate concepts and to abstract knowledge coming from different tasks to synergistically exploit them when learning novel skills. To accomplish this we look for a unified approach to video understanding which combines shared temporal modelling of human actions with minimal overhead to support multiple downstream tasks and enable cooperation when learning novel skills. We then propose EgoPack a solution that creates a collection of task perspectives that can be carried across downstream tasks and used as a potential source of additional insights as a backpack of skills that a robot can carry around and use when needed.

Recent work shows promise by decomposing such tasks using a large language model (LLM) into an executable program that invokes specialized vision models. However generated programs are error-prone: they omit necessary steps include spurious ones and are unable to recover when the specialized models give incorrect outputs. Moreover they require loading multiple models incurring high latency and computation costs. We propose Visual Program Distillation (VPD) an instruction-tuning framework that produces a vision-language model (VLM) capable of solving complex visual tasks with a single forward pass. VPD distills the reasoning ability of LLMs by using them to sample multiple candidate programs which are then executed and verified to identify the correct one. It translates each correct program into a language description of the reasoning steps which are then distilled into a VLM. Extensive experiments show that VPD improves the VLM's ability to count understand spatial relations and reason compositionally. Our VPD-trained PaLI-X outperforms all prior VLMs achieving state-of-the-art performance across complex vision tasks including MMBench OK-VQA A-OKVQA TallyQA POPE and Hateful Memes. An evaluation with human annotators also confirms that VPD improves model response factuality and consistency. Finally experiments on content moderation demonstrate that VPD is also helpful for adaptation to real-world applications with limited data."},

To defend the backdoor prior research has focused on using clean data to remove backdoor attacks before model deployment. In this paper we investigate the possibility of defending against backdoor attacks by utilizing test-time partially poisoned data to remove the backdoor from the model. To address the problem a two-stage method TTBD is proposed. In the first stage we propose a backdoor sample detection method DDP to identify poisoned samples from a batch of mixed partially poisoned samples. Once the poisoned samples are detected we employ Shapley estimation to calculate the contribution of each neuron's significance in the network locate the poisoned neurons and prune them to remove backdoor in the models.

This is why pose estimation methods generally perform worse on the test set than on the training set. Recently test-time adaptation has proven to be an effective way to deal with domain shift in human pose estimation. Although the performance on the target domain has been improved existing methods require a large number of weight updates for convergence which is time-consuming and brings catastrophic forgetting. To solve these issues we propose a meta-auxiliary learning method to achieve fast adaptation for domain shift during inference. Specifically we take human pose estimation as the supervised primary task and propose body-specific image inpainting as a self-supervised auxiliary task. First we jointly train the primary and auxiliary tasks to get a pre-trained model on the source domain. Then meta-training correlates the performance of the two tasks to learn a good weight initialization. Finally meta-testing adapts the meta-learned model to the target data through self-supervised learning. Benefiting from the meta-learning paradigm the proposed method enables fast adaptation to the target domain while preserving the source domain knowledge. The carefully designed auxiliary task better pays attention to human-related semantics in a single image. Extensive experiments demonstrate the effectiveness of our test-time fast adaptation."},

Given the evolving environment and the multitude of object classes it is impractical to include all possible classes during the training stage. In this paper we aim at advancing active open-vocabulary recognition empowering embodied agents to actively perceive and classify arbitrary objects. However directly adopting recent open-vocabulary classification models like Contrastive Language Image Pretraining (CLIP) poses its unique challenges. Specifically we observe that CLIP's performance is heavily affected by the viewpoint and occlusions compromising its reliability in unconstrained embodied perception scenarios. Further the sequential nature of observations in agent-environment interactions necessitates an effective method for integrating features that maintains discriminative strength for open-vocabulary classification. To address these issues we introduce a novel agent for active open-vocabulary recognition. The proposed method leverages inter-frame and inter-concept similarities to navigate agent movements and to fuse features without relying on class-specific knowledge. Compared to baseline CLIP model with 29.6% accuracy on ShapeNet dataset the proposed agent could achieve 53.3% accuracy for open-vocabulary recognition without any fine-tuning to the equipped CLIP model. Additional experiments conducted with the Habitat simulator further affirm the efficacy of our method."},

However only a few works consider human-scene interactions together with text conditions which is crucial for visual and physical realism. This paper focuses on the task of generating human motions in 3D indoor scenes given text descriptions of the human-scene interactions. This task presents challenges due to the multimodality nature of text scene and motion as well as the need for spatial reasoning. To address these challenges we propose a new approach that decomposes the complex problem into two more manageable sub-problems: (1) language grounding of the target object and (2) object-centric motion generation. For language grounding of the target object we leverage the power of large language models. For motion generation we design an object-centric scene representation for the generative model to focus on the target object thereby reducing the scene complexity and facilitating the modeling of the relationship between human motions and the object.

Current methods often rely on supplementary modules or specific architectural designs potentially limiting their applicability to new and evolving architectures. To our knowledge we are the first to propose a versatile technique that seamlessly integrates into any existing framework for 3D Object Detection marking the first instance of Weak-to-Strong generalization in 3D computer vision. We introduce a novel framework X-Ray Distillation with Object-Complete Frames suitable for both supervised and semi-supervised settings that leverages the temporal aspect of point cloud sequences. This method extracts crucial information from both previous and subsequent LiDAR frames creating Object-Complete frames that represent objects from multiple viewpoints thus addressing occlusion and sparsity. Given the limitation of not being able to generate Object-Complete frames during online inference we utilize Knowledge Distillation within a Teacher-Student framework. This technique encourages the strong Student model to emulate the behavior of the weaker Teacher which processes simple and informative Object-Complete frames effectively offering a comprehensive view of objects as if seen through X-ray vision. Our proposed methods surpass state-of-the-art in semi-supervised learning by 1-1.5 mAP and enhance the performance of five established supervised models by 1-2 mAP on standard autonomous driving datasets even with default hyperparameters.

With multiple sound sources and background disturbances involved establishing robust correspondences between audio and visual contents poses unique challenges due to (1) complex entanglement across sound sources and (2) frequent changes in the occurrence of distinct sound events. Assuming sound events occur independently the multi-source semantic space can be represented as the Cartesian product of single-source sub-spaces. We are motivated to decompose the multi-source audio semantics into single-source semantics for more effective interactions with visual content. We propose a semantic decomposition method based on product quantization where the multi-source semantics can be decomposed and represented by several disentangled and noise-suppressed single-source semantics. Furthermore we introduce a global-to-local quantization mechanism which distills knowledge from stable global (clip-level) features into local (frame-level) ones to handle frequent changes in audio semantics. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our semantically decomposed audio representation significantly improves AVS performance eg +21.2% mIoU on the challenging AVS-Semantic benchmark with ResNet50 backbone."},

Continual learning (CL) aims to overcome this limitation by enabling DNNs to incrementally accumulate knowledge. A widely adopted scenario in CL is class-incremental learning (CIL) where DNNs are required to sequentially learn more classes. Among the various strategies in CL replay methods which revisit previous classes stand out as the only effective ones in CIL. Other strategies such as architectural modifications to segregate information across weights and protect them from change are ineffective in CIL. This is because they need additional information during testing to select the correct network parts to use. In this paper we propose NICE Neurogenesis Inspired Contextual Encoding a replay-free architectural method inspired by adult neurogenesis in the hippocampus. NICE groups neurons in the DNN based on different maturation stages and infers which neurons to use during testing without any additional signal. Through extensive experiments across 6 datasets and 3 architectures we show that NICE performs on par with or often outperforms replay methods.

The existing methods for active object detection (AOD) primarily rely on visual appearance of the objects within input such as changes in size shape and relationship with hands. However these visual changes can be subtle posing challenges particularly in scenarios with multiple distracting no-change instances of the same category. We observe that the state changes are often the result of an interaction being performed upon the object thus propose to use informed priors about object related plausible interactions (including semantics and visual appearance) to provide more reliable cues for AOD. Specifically we propose a knowledge aggregation procedure to integrate the aforementioned informed priors into oracle queries within the teacher decoder offering more object affordance commonsense to locate the active object. To streamline the inference process and reduce extra knowledge inputs we propose a knowledge distillation approach that encourages the student decoder to mimic the detection capabilities of the teacher decoder using the oracle query by replicating its predictions and attention.

Therefore to learn the multi-dimensional human preferences we propose the Multi-dimensional Preference Score (MPS) the first multi-dimensional preference scoring model for the evaluation of text-to-image models. The MPS introduces the preference condition module upon CLIP model to learn these diverse preferences. It is trained based on our Multi-dimensional Human Preference (MHP) Dataset which comprises 918315 human preference choices across four dimensions (i.e. aesthetics semantic alignment detail quality and overall assessment) on 607541 images. The images are generated by a wide range of latest text-to-image models.

It requires an understanding of the underlying 3D structure of the object from an image and rendering high-quality spatially consistent new views. While recent methods for view synthesis based on diffusion have shown great progress achieving consistency among various view estimates and at the same time abiding by the desired camera pose remains a critical problem yet to be solved. In this work we demonstrate a strikingly simple method where we utilize a pre-trained video diffusion model to solve this problem. Our key idea is that synthesizing a novel view could be reformulated as synthesizing a video of a camera going around the object of interest---a scanning video---which then allows us to leverage the powerful priors that a video diffusion model would have learned. Thus to perform novel-view synthesis we create a smooth camera trajectory to the target view that we wish to render and denoise using both a view-conditioned diffusion model and a video diffusion model. By doing so we obtain a highly consistent novel view synthesis outperforming the state of the art."},

While labels are needed for the adaptation acquiring them is typically expensive. To overcome this challenge active learning a method of achieving a high performance by obtaining labels for a small number of samples from experts has been studied. Active learning primarily focuses on selecting unlabeled samples for labeling and leveraging them to train models. In this study we pose the question \"how can the pre-trained VLMs be adapted under the active learning framework?\" In response to this inquiry we observe that (1) simply applying a conventional active learning framework to pre-trained VLMs even may degrade performance compared to random selection because of the class imbalance in labeling candidates and (2) the knowledge of VLMs can provide hints for achieving the balance before labeling. Based on these observations we devise a novel active learning framework for VLMs denoted as PCB. To assess the effectiveness of our approach we conduct experiments on seven different real-world datasets and the results demonstrate that PCB surpasses conventional active learning and random sampling methods."},

These approaches often require retraining/fine-tuning using a few images leading to time-consuming training processes and impeding their swift implementation. Furthermore the reliance on multiple images to represent a singular concept increases the difficulty of customization. To this end we propose FreeCustom a novel tuning-free method to generate customized images of multi-concept composition based on reference concepts using only one image per concept as input.

The majority of existing estimation methods still rely on single-view images as input leading to potential limitations e.g. limited field-of-view and ambiguity in depth. To address these problems adding another camera to better capture the shape of hands is a practical direction. However existing multi-view hand pose estimation methods suffer from two main drawbacks: 1) Requiring multi-view annotations for training which are expensive. 2) During testing the model becomes inapplicable if camera parameters/layout are not the same as those used in training. In this paper we propose a novel Single-to-Dual-view adaptation (S2DHand) solution that adapts a pre-trained single-view estimator to dual views. Compared with existing multi-view training methods 1) our adaptation process is unsupervised eliminating the need for multi-view annotation. 2) Moreover our method can handle arbitrary dual-view pairs with unknown camera parameters making the model applicable to diverse camera settings. Specifically S2DHand is built on certain stereo constraints including pair-wise cross-view consensus and invariance of transformation between both views. These two stereo constraints are used in a complementary manner to generate pseudo-labels allowing reliable adaptation. Evaluation results reveal that S2DHand achieves significant improvements on arbitrary camera pairs under both in-dataset and cross-dataset settings and outperforms existing adaptation methods with leading performance.

While significant efforts have been made towards anticipating future actions prior approaches do not take into account the aspect of plausibility in an action sequence. To address this limitation we explore the generative capability of a large video-language model in our work and further develop the understanding of plausibility in an action sequence by introducing two objective functions a counterfactual-based plausible action sequence learning loss and a long-horizon action repetition loss. We utilize temporal logical constraints as well as verb-noun action pair logical constraints to create implausible/counterfactual action sequences and use them to train the model with plausible action sequence learning loss. This loss helps the model to differentiate between plausible and not plausible action sequences and also helps the model to learn implicit temporal cues crucial for the task of action anticipation. The long-horizon action repetition loss puts a higher penalty on the actions that are more prone to repetition over a longer temporal window. With this penalization the model is able to generate diverse plausible action sequences. We evaluate our approach on two large-scale datasets Ego4D and EPIC-Kitchens-100 and show improvements on the task of action anticipation."},

This work compares for the first time the main approaches for estimating the image-matching uncertainty including the traditional retrieval-based uncertainty estimation more recent data-driven aleatoric uncertainty estimation and the compute-intensive geometric verification. We further formulate a simple baseline method \"SUE\" which unlike the other methods considers the freely-available poses of the reference images in the map. Our experiments reveal that a simple L2-distance between the query and reference descriptors is already a better estimate of image-matching uncertainty than current data-driven approaches. SUE outperforms the other efficient uncertainty estimation methods and its uncertainty estimates complement the computationally expensive geometric verification approach. Future works for uncertainty estimation in VPR should consider the baselines discussed in this work."},

Despite significant progress in recent years most state-of-the-art (SOTA) methods still suffer from considerable language-image modality gap at the pixel and word level. These methods generally 1) rely on sentence-level language features for language-image alignment and 2) lack explicit training supervision for fine-grained visual grounding. Consequently they exhibit weak object-level correspondence between visual and language features. Without well-grounded features prior methods struggle to understand complex expressions that require strong reasoning over relationships among multiple objects especially when dealing with rarely used or ambiguous clauses. To tackle this challenge we introduce a novel Mask Grounding auxiliary task that significantly improves visual grounding within language features by explicitly teaching the model to learn fine-grained correspondence between masked textual tokens and their matching visual objects. Mask Grounding can be directly used on prior RIS methods and consistently bring improvements. Furthermore to holistically address the modality gap we also design a cross-modal alignment loss and an accompanying alignment module. These additions work synergistically with Mask Grounding. With all these techniques our comprehensive approach culminates in MagNet (Mask-grounded Network) an architecture that significantly outperforms prior arts on three key benchmarks (RefCOCO RefCOCO+ and G-Ref) demonstrating our method's effectiveness in addressing current limitations of RIS algorithms. Our code and pre-trained weights will be released."},
{"title": "FreeKD: Knowledge Distillation via Semantic Frequency Prompt", "authors": "Yuan Zhang, Tao Huang, Jiaming Liu, Tao Jiang, Kuan Cheng, Shanghang Zhang", "abstract": "Knowledge distillation (KD) has been applied to various tasks successfully and mainstream methods typically boost the student model via spatial imitation losses. However the consecutive downsamplings induced in the spatial domain of teacher model is a type of corruption hindering the student from analyzing what specific information needs to be imitated which results in accuracy degradation. To better understand the underlying pattern of corrupted feature maps we shift our attention to the frequency domain. During frequency distillation we encounter a new challenge: the low-frequency bands convey general but minimal context while the high are more informative but also introduce noise. Not each pixel within the frequency bands contributes equally to the performance. To address the above problem: (1) We propose the Frequency Prompt plugged into the teacher model absorbing the semantic frequency context during finetuning. (2) During the distillation period a pixel-wise frequency mask is generated via Frequency Prompt to localize those pixel of interests (PoIs) in various frequency bands. Additionally we employ a position-aware relational frequency loss for dense prediction tasks delivering a high-order spatial enhancement to the student model. We dub our Frequency Knowledge Distillation method as FreeKD which determines the optimal localization and extent for the frequency distillation. Extensive experiments demonstrate that FreeKD not only outperforms spatial-based distillation methods consistently on dense prediction tasks (e.g. FreeKD brings 3.8 AP gains for RepPoints-R50 on COCO2017 and 4.55 mIoU gains for PSPNet-R18 on Cityscapes) but also conveys more robustness to the student. Notably we also validate the generalization of our approach on large-scale vision models (e.g. DINO and SAM)."},

Creating computer-generated videos however is a tedious manual process which can be automated by emerging text-to-video diffusion models.

To address this challenge we present a novel approach that combines the controllability of dynamic 3D meshes with the expressivity and editability of emerging diffusion models. For this purpose our approach takes an animated low-fidelity rendered mesh as input and injects the ground truth correspondence information obtained from the dynamic mesh into various stages of a pre-trained text-to-image generation model to output high-quality and temporally consistent frames. We demonstrate our approach on various examples where motion can be obtained by animating rigged assets or changing the camera path."},

In this work we present Relightable Gaussian Codec Avatars a method to build high-fidelity relightable head avatars that can be animated to generate novel expressions. Our geometry model based on 3D Gaussians can capture 3D-consistent sub-millimeter details such as hair strands and pores on dynamic face sequences. To support diverse materials of human heads such as the eyes skin and hair in a unified manner we present a novel relightable appearance model based on learnable radiance transfer. Together with global illumination-aware spherical harmonics for the diffuse components we achieve real-time relighting with all-frequency reflections using spherical Gaussians. This appearance model can be efficiently relit under both point light and continuous illumination.

The captured sparse views for these scenes usually contain large viewpoint variations. This greatly reduces the potential consistency between views leading NeRFs to degrade a lot in these scenarios. Existing methods usually leverage pretrained depth prediction models to improve NeRFs. However these methods cannot guarantee geometry consistency due to the inherent geometry ambiguity in the pretrained models thus limiting NeRFs' performance. In this work we present P\\textsuperscript 2 NeRF to capture global and hierarchical geometry consistency priors from pretrained models thus facilitating few-shot NeRFs in 360^\\circ outward-facing indoor scenes. On the one hand we propose a matching-based geometry warm-up strategy to provide global geometry consistency priors for NeRFs. This effectively avoids the overfitting of early training with sparse inputs. On the other hand we propose a group depth ranking loss and ray weight mask regularization based on the monocular depth estimation model. This provides hierarchical geometry consistency priors for NeRFs.

Existing works have attained partial success by extensively leveraging various sources of information available in the datasets such as heavy intermediate visual observations procedural names or natural language step-by-step instructions for features or supervision signals. However the task remains formidable due to the implicit causal constraints in the sequencing of steps and the variability inherent in multiple feasible plans. To tackle these intricacies that previous efforts have overlooked we propose to enhance the agent's capabilities by infusing it with procedural knowledge. This knowledge sourced from training procedure plans and structured as a directed weighted graph equips the agent to better navigate the complexities of step sequencing and its potential variations.

{"title": "SingularTrajectory: Universal Trajectory Predictor Using Diffusion Model", "authors": "Inhwan Bae, Young-Jae Park, Hae-Gon Jeon", "abstract": "There are five types of trajectory prediction tasks: deterministic stochastic domain adaptation momentary observation and few-shot. These associated tasks are defined by various factors such as the length of input paths data split and pre-processing methods. Interestingly even though they commonly take sequential coordinates of observations as input and infer future paths in the same coordinates as output designing specialized architectures for each task is still necessary. For the other task generality issues can lead to sub-optimal performances. In this paper we propose SingularTrajectory a diffusion-based universal trajectory prediction framework to reduce the performance gap across the five tasks. The core of SingularTrajectory is to unify a variety of human dynamics representations on the associated tasks. To do this we first build a Singular space to project all types of motion patterns from each task into one embedding space. We next propose an adaptive anchor working in the Singular space. Unlike traditional fixed anchor methods that sometimes yield unacceptable paths our adaptive anchor enables correct anchors which are put into a wrong location based on a traversability map. Finally we adopt a diffusion-based predictor to further enhance the prototype paths using a cascaded denoising process. Our unified framework ensures the generality across various benchmark settings such as input modality and trajectory lengths. Extensive experiments on five public benchmarks demonstrate that SingularTrajectory substantially outperforms existing models highlighting its effectiveness in estimating general dynamics of human movements.

In particular we make two interesting and surprising empirical observations. First to outperform a simple Linear Probing baseline these methods require to optimize their hyper-parameters on each target task. And second they typically underperform --sometimes dramatically-- standard zero-shot predictions in the presence of distributional drifts. Motivated by the unrealistic assumptions made in the existing literature i.e. access to a large validation set and case-specific grid-search for optimal hyperparameters we propose a novel approach that meets the requirements of real-world scenarios. More concretely we introduce a CLass-Adaptive linear Probe (CLAP) objective whose balancing term is optimized via an adaptation of the general Augmented Lagrangian method tailored to this context.

Since symbolic sequences are naturally graph-structured data we formulate HMEG as a graph-to-image (G2I) generation problem. Unlike the generation of natural images HMEG requires critic layout clarity for synthesizing correct and recognizable formulas but has no real masks available to supervise the learning process. To alleviate this challenge we propose a novel end-to-end G2I generation pipeline (i.e. graph - layout - mask - image) which requires no real masks or nondifferentiable alignment between layouts and masks. Technically to boost the capacity of predicting detailed relations among adjacent symbols we propose a Less-is-More (LiM) learning strategy. In addition we design a differentiable layout refinement module which maps bounding boxes to pixel-level soft masks so as to further alleviate ambiguous layout areas. Our whole model including layout prediction mask refinement and image generation can be jointly optimized in an end-to-end manner. Experimental results show that our model can generate high-quality HME images and outperforms previous generative methods.

Most previous approaches rely on extracting high-level feature maps from the frozen visual encoder to compute the pixel-wise similarity as a key prior guidance for the decoder. However such a prior representation suffers from coarse granularity and poor generalization to new classes since these high-level feature maps have obvious category bias. In this work we propose to replace the visual prior representation with the visual-text alignment capacity to capture more reliable guidance and enhance the model generalization. Specifically we design two kinds of training-free prior information generation strategy that attempts to utilize the semantic alignment capability of the Contrastive Language-Image Pre-training model (CLIP) to locate the target class. Besides to acquire more accurate prior guidance we build a high-order relationship of attention maps and utilize it to refine the initial prior information.

We propose an Unsupervised Universal Segmentation model (U2Seg) adept at performing various image segmentation tasks---instance semantic and panoptic---using a novel unified framework. U2Seg generates pseudo semantic labels for these segmentation tasks via leveraging self-supervised models followed by clustering; each cluster represents different semantic and/or instance membership of pixels. We then self-train the model on these pseudo semantic labels yielding substantial performance gains over specialized methods tailored to each task: a +2.6 APbox boost (vs. CutLER) in unsupervised instance segmentation on COCO and a +7.0 PixelAcc increase (vs. STEGO) in unsupervised semantic segmentation on COCOStuff. Moreover our method sets up a new baseline for unsupervised panoptic segmentation which has not been previously explored.

There exist methods to adapt 3D-ODs to these domains; however these methods treat 3D-ODs as a black box neglecting underlying architectural decisions and source-domain training strategies. Instead we dive deep into the details of 3D-ODs focusing our efforts on fundamental factors that influence robustness prior to domain adaptation. We systematically investigate four design choices (and the interplay between them) often overlooked in 3D-OD robustness and domain adaptation: architecture voxel encoding data augmentations and anchor strategies. We assess their impact on the robustness of nine state-of-the-art 3D-ODs across six benchmarks encompassing three types of domain gaps - sensor type weather and location. Our main findings are: (1) transformer backbones with local point features are more robust than 3D CNNs (2) test-time anchor size adjustment is crucial for adaptation across geographical locations significantly boosting scores without retraining (3) source-domain augmentations allow the model to generalize to low-resolution sensors and (4) surprisingly robustness to bad weather is improved when training directly on more clean weather data than on training with bad weather data.

Yet these models have not been systematically evaluated on data captured by BLV users. We address this by empirically assessing CLIP a widely-used LMM likely to underpin many assistive technologies. Testing 25 CLIP variants in a zero-shot classification task we find that their accuracy is 15 percentage points lower on average for images captured by BLV users than web-crawled images. This disparity stems from CLIP's sensitivities to 1) image content (e.g. not recognizing disability objects as well as other objects); 2) image quality (e.g. not being robust to lighting variation); and 3) text content (e.g. not recognizing objects described by tactile adjectives as well as visual ones). We delve deeper with a textual analysis of three common pre-training datasets: LAION-400M LAION-2B and DataComp-1B showing that disability content is rarely mentioned. We then provide three examples that illustrate how the performance disparities extend to three downstream models underpinned by CLIP: OWL-ViT CLIPSeg and DALL-E2.

This underscores the critical need for dataset pruning as the quality of these datasets is strongly correlated with the performance of VLMs on downstream tasks. Using CLIPScore from a pretrained model to only train models using highly-aligned samples is one of the most successful methods for pruning. We argue that this approach suffers from multiple limitations including: false positives and negatives due to CLIP's pretraining on noisy labels. We propose a pruning signal Sieve that employs synthetic captions generated by image-captioning models pretrained on small diverse and well-aligned image-text pairs to evaluate the alignment of noisy image-text pairs. To bridge the gap between the limited diversity of generated captions and the high diversity of alternative text (alt-text) we estimate the semantic textual similarity in the embedding space of a language model pretrained on unlabeled text corpus. Using DataComp a multimodal dataset filtering benchmark when evaluating on 38 downstream tasks our pruning approach surpasses CLIPScore by 2.6% and 1.7% on medium and large scale respectively.

Moreover the self-attention mechanism in deep ViTs is also susceptible to the attention saturation issue. Accordingly we argue against the necessity of computing the attention scores in every layer and we propose the Less-Attention Vision Transformer (LaViT) which computes only a few attention operations at each stage and calculates the subsequent feature alignments in other layers via attention transformations that leverage the previously calculated attention scores. This novel approach can mitigate two primary issues plaguing traditional self-attention modules: the heavy computational burden and attention saturation.

To tackle the problem this paper designs a versatile framework to capture high-quality supervision signals from three aspects: 1) The adaptive thresholds are employed to determine the reliability of pseudo-labels; 2) The knowledge from the source pre-trained model is utilized to adjust the unreliable one and 3) By evaluating past supervision signals we calculate a diversity score to ensure subsequent generalization. In this way we form a complete supervisory signal generation framework which can capture the current domain discriminative and reserve generalization in future domains.

Inspired by this we propose a method to improve resilience to adversarial attacks by learning a robust text prompt for VLMs. The proposed method named Adversarial Prompt Tuning (APT) is effective while being both computationally and data efficient. Extensive experiments are conducted across 15 datasets and 4 data sparsity schemes (from 1-shot to full training data settings) to show APT's superiority over hand-engineered prompts and other state-of-the-art adaption methods. APT demonstrated excellent abilities in terms of the in-distribution performance and the generalization under input distribution shift and across datasets.

While existing 3D hair modeling methods have achieved impressive performance the challenge of achieving high-quality hair reconstruction persists: they either require strict capture conditions making practical applications difficult or heavily rely on learned prior data obscuring fine-grained details in images. To address these challenges we propose MonoHair a generic framework to achieve high-fidelity hair reconstruction from a monocular video without specific requirements for environments. Our approach bifurcates the hair modeling process into two main stages: precise exterior reconstruction and interior structure inference. The exterior is meticulously crafted using our Patch-based Multi-View Optimization PMVO. This method strategically collects and integrates hair information from multiple views independent of prior data to produce a high-fidelity exterior 3D line map. This map not only captures intricate details but also facilitates the inference of the hair's inner structure. For the interior we employ a data-driven multi-view 3D hair reconstruction method. This method utilizes 2D structural renderings derived from the reconstructed exterior mirroring the synthetic 2D inputs used during training. This alignment effectively bridges the domain gap between our training data and real-world data thereby enhancing the accuracy and reliability of our interior structure inference. Lastly we generate a strand model and resolve the directional ambiguity by our hair growth algorithm. Our experiments demonstrate that our method exhibits robustness across diverse hairstyles and achieves state-of-the-art performance.

However current SDS-based models still struggle with intricate text prompts and commonly result in distorted 3D models with unrealistic textures or cross-view inconsistency issues. In this work we introduce a novel Visual Prompt-guided text-to-3D diffusion model (VP3D) that explicitly unleashes the visual appearance knowledge in 2D visual prompt to boost text-to-3D generation. Instead of solely supervising SDS with text prompt VP3D first capitalizes on 2D diffusion model to generate a high-quality image from input text which subsequently acts as visual prompt to strengthen SDS optimization with explicit visual appearance. Meanwhile we couple the SDS optimization with additional differentiable reward function that encourages rendering images of 3D models to better visually align with 2D visual prompt and semantically match with text prompt. Through extensive experiments we show that the 2D Visual Prompt in our VP3D significantly eases the learning of visual appearance of 3D models and thus leads to higher visual fidelity with more detailed textures.

To alleviate this issue in this paper we propose a novel Content-Style Decoupled Makeup Transfer (CSD-MT) method which works in a purely unsupervised manner and thus eliminates the negative effects of generating PGTs. Specifically based on the frequency characteristics analysis we assume that the low-frequency (LF) component of a face image is more associated with its makeup style information while the high-frequency (HF) component is more related to its content details. This assumption allows CSD-MT to decouple the content and makeup style information in each face image through the frequency decomposition. After that CSD-MT realizes makeup transfer by maximizing the consistency of these two types of information between the transferred result and input images respectively. Two newly designed loss functions are also introduced to further improve the transfer performance. Extensive quantitative and qualitative analyses show the effectiveness of our CSD-MT method.

Jeni, Simon Lucey", "abstract": "The lifting of a 3D structure and camera from 2D landmarks is at the cornerstone of the discipline of computer vision. Traditional methods have been confined to specific rigid objects such as those in Perspective-n-Point (PnP) problems but deep learning has expanded our capability to reconstruct a wide range of object classes (e.g. C3DPO [??] and PAUL [??]) with resilience to noise occlusions and perspective distortions. However all these techniques have been limited by the fundamental need to establish correspondences across the 3D training data significantly limiting their utility to applications where one has an abundance of \"in-correspondence\" 3D data. Our approach harnesses the inherent permutation equivariance of transformers to manage varying numbers of points per 3D data instance withstands occlusions and generalizes to unseen categories. We demonstrate state-of-the-art performance across 2D-3D lifting task benchmarks. Since our approach can be trained across such a broad class of structures we refer to it simply as a 3D Lifting Foundation Model (3D-LFM) -- the first of its kind."},

Unfortunately existing methods usually formulate this task as a voxel-wise classification problem and treat each voxel equally in 3D space during training. As the hard voxels have not been paid enough attention the performance in some challenging regions is limited. The 3D dense space typically contains a large number of empty voxels which are easy to learn but require amounts of computation due to handling all the voxels uniformly for the existing models. Furthermore the voxels in the boundary region are more challenging to differentiate than those in the interior. In this paper we propose HASSC approach to train the semantic scene completion model with hardness-aware design. The global hardness from the network optimization process is defined for dynamical hard voxel selection. Then the local hardness with geometric anisotropy is adopted for voxel-wise refinement. Besides self-distillation strategy is introduced to make training process stable and consistent. Extensive experiments show that our HASSC scheme can effectively promote the accuracy of the baseline model without incurring the extra inference cost.

Given the novelty of these models the impact of visual adversarial attacks on LMMs has not been thoroughly examined. We conduct a comprehensive study of the robustness of various LMMs against different adversarial attacks evaluated across tasks including image classification image captioning and Visual Question Answer (VQA). We find that in general LMMs are not robust to visual adversarial inputs. However our findings suggest that context provided to the model via prompts--such as questions in a QA pair--helps to mitigate the effects of visual adversarial inputs. Notably the LMMs evaluated demonstrated remarkable resilience to such attacks on the ScienceQA task with only an 8.10% drop in performance compared to their visual counterparts which dropped 99.73%. We also propose a new approach to real-world image classification which we term query decomposition. By incorporating existence queries into our input prompt we observe diminished attack effectiveness and improvements in image classification accuracy. This research highlights a previously under explored facet of LMM robustness and sets the stage for future work aimed at strengthening the resilience of multimodal systems in adversarial environments."},

Many few-shot object detection (FSOD) methods have been proposed to tackle this issue by adopting image-level augmentations in linear manners. Nevertheless those handcrafted enhancements often suffer from limited diversity and lack of semantic awareness resulting in unsatisfactory performance. To this end we propose a Semantic-guided Non-linear Instance-level Data Augmentation method (SNIDA) for FSOD by decoupling the foreground and background to increase their diversities respectively. We design a semantic awareness enhancement strategy to separate objects from backgrounds. Concretely masks of instances are extracted by an unsupervised semantic segmentation module. Then the diversity of samples would be improved by fusing instances into different backgrounds. Considering the shortcomings of augmenting images in a limited transformation space of existing traditional data augmentation methods we introduce an object reconstruction enhancement module. The aim of this module is to generate sufficient diversity and non-linear training data at the instance level through a semantic-guided masked autoencoder. In this way the potential of data can be fully exploited in various object detection scenarios. Extensive experiments on PASCAL VOC and MS-COCO demonstrate that the proposed method outperforms baselines by a large margin and achieves new state-of-the-art results under different shot settings."},

To overcome the fundamental limitation of missing 3D consistency in 2D diffusion models our key insight is to introduce three synergetic strategies that augment the input of the 2D diffusion model to become 3D-aware and to explicitly enforce 3D consistency during the training process. Specifically we design surrounding views as context-rich input for the 2D diffusion model and generate 3D-consistent structured noise instead of image-independent noise. Moreover we introduce self-supervised consistency-enforcing training within the per-scene editing procedure. Extensive evaluation shows that our ConsistDreamer achieves state-of-the-art performance for instruction-guided scene editing across various scenes and editing instructions particularly in complicated large-scale indoor scenes from ScanNet++ with significantly improved sharpness and fine-grained textures.

Essentially the 3D hand pose estimation can be regarded as a 3D point subset generative problem conditioned on input frames. Thanks to the recent significant progress on diffusion-based generative models hand pose estimation can also benefit from the diffusion model to estimate keypoint locations with high quality. However directly deploying the existing diffusion models to solve hand pose estimation is non-trivial since they cannot achieve the complex permutation mapping and precise localization. Based on this motivation this paper proposes HandDiff a diffusion-based hand pose estimation model that iteratively denoises accurate hand pose conditioned on hand-shaped image-point clouds. In order to recover keypoint permutation and accurate location we further introduce joint-wise condition and local detail condition. Experimental results demonstrate that the proposed HandDiff significantly outperforms the existing approaches on four challenging hand pose benchmark datasets.

To achieve the personalization capability existing methods rely on finetuning a text-to-image foundation model on a user's custom dataset which can be non-trivial for general users resource-intensive and time-consuming. Despite attempts to develope finetuning-free methods their generation quality is much lower compared to their finetuning counterparts.

Our key idea is to learn the joint distribution of multiple related text-image pairs that share a common subject. To facilitate learning we propose a scalable synthetic dataset generation technique.

In this work we aim to develop a vision-language model that can take locations for example a set of points or boxes as either inputs or outputs. When taking locations as inputs the model performs location-conditioned captioning which generates captions for the indicated object or region. When generating locations as outputs our model regresses pixel coordinates for each output word generated by the language model and thus performs dense word grounding. Our model is pre-trained on the Localized Narrative dataset which contains pixel-word-aligned captioning from human attention.

Despite current Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) and Large Language Models (LLMs) being trained on mega-scale datasets recognizing unseen images or understanding novel concepts in a training-free manner remains a challenge. In-Context Learning (ICL) explores training-free few-shot learning where models are encouraged to \"learn to learn\" from limited tasks and generalize to unseen tasks. In this work we propose link-context learning (LCL) which emphasizes \"reasoning from cause and effect\" to augment the learning capabilities of MLLMs. LCL goes beyond traditional ICL by explicitly strengthening the causal relationship between the support set and the query set. By providing demonstrations with causal links LCL guides the model to discern not only the analogy but also the underlying causal associations between data points which empowers MLLMs to recognize unseen images and understand novel concepts more effectively. To facilitate the evaluation of this novel approach we introduce the ISEKAI dataset comprising exclusively of unseen generated image-label pairs designed for link-context learning.

Most of existing methods need to infer pseudo segmentation for training by serial alignment between all frames and the transcript which is time-consuming and hard to be parallelized while training. In this work we aim to escape from this inefficient alignment with massive but redundant frames and instead to directly localize a few action transitions for pseudo segmentation generation where a transition refers to the change from an action segment to its next adjacent one in the transcript. As the true transitions are submerged in noisy boundaries due to intra-segment visual variation we propose a novel Action-Transition-Aware Boundary Alignment (ATBA) framework to efficiently and effectively filter out noisy boundaries and detect transitions. In addition to boost the semantic learning in the case that noise is inevitably present in the pseudo segmentation we also introduce video-level losses to utilize the trusted video-level supervision. Extensive experiments show the effectiveness of our approach on both performance and training speed."},

{"title": "High-fidelity Person-centric Subject-to-Image Synthesis", "authors": "Yibin Wang, Weizhong Zhang, Jianwei Zheng, Cheng Jin", "abstract": "Current subject-driven image generation methods encounter significant challenges in person-centric image generation. The reason is that they learn the semantic scene and person generation by fine-tuning a common pre-trained diffusion which involves an irreconcilable training imbalance. Precisely to generate realistic persons they need to sufficiently tune the pre-trained model which inevitably causes the model to forget the rich semantic scene prior and makes scene generation over-fit to the training data. Moreover even with sufficient fine-tuning these methods can still not generate high-fidelity persons since joint learning of the scene and person generation also lead to quality compromise. In this paper we propose Face-diffuser an effective collaborative generation pipeline to eliminate the above training imbalance and quality compromise. Specifically we first develop two specialized pre-trained diffusion models i.e. Text-driven Diffusion Model (TDM) and Subject-augmented Diffusion Model (SDM) for scene and person generation respectively. The sampling process is divided into three sequential stages i.e. semantic scene construction subject-scene fusion and subject enhancement. The first and last stages are performed by TDM and SDM respectively. The subject-scene fusion stage that is the collaboration achieved through a novel and highly effective mechanism Saliency-adaptive Noise Fusion (SNF). Specifically it is based on our key observation that there exists a robust link between classifier-free guidance responses and the saliency of generated images. In each time step SNF leverages the unique strengths of each model and allows for the spatial blending of predicted noises from both models automatically in a saliency-aware manner all of which can be seamlessly integrated into the DDIM sampling process. Extensive experiments confirm the impressive effectiveness and robustness of the Face-diffuser in generating high-fidelity person images depicting multiple unseen persons with varying contexts.

Recent advancements have predominantly embraced a coarse-to-fine matching mechanism with the key to matching the superpoints located in patches with inter-frame consistent structures. However previous methods still face challenges with ambiguous matching because the interference information aggregated from irrelevant regions may disturb the capture of inter-frame consistency relations leading to wrong matches. To address this issue we propose Dynamic Cues-Assisted Transformer (DCATr). Firstly the interference from irrelevant regions is greatly reduced by constraining attention to certain cues i.e. regions with highly correlated structures of potential corresponding superpoints. Secondly cues-assisted attention is designed to mine the inter-frame consistency relations while more attention is assigned to pairs with high consistent confidence in feature aggregation. Finally a dynamic updating fashion is proposed to facilitate mining richer consistency information further improving aggregated features' distinctiveness and relieving matching ambiguity. Extensive evaluations on indoor and outdoor standard benchmarks demonstrate that DCATr outperforms all state-of-the-art methods."},

Patch2Self (P2S) employing self-supervised techniques and regression on a Casorati matrix effectively denoises dMRI images and has become the new de-facto standard in this field. P2S however is resource intensive both in terms of running time and memory usage as it uses all voxels (n) from all-but-one held-in volumes (d-1) to learn a linear mapping Phi : \\mathbb R ^ n x(d-1)  \\mapsto \\mathbb R ^ n  for denoising the held-out volume. The increasing size and dimensionality of higher resolution dMRI acquisitions can make P2S infeasible for large-scale analyses. This work exploits the redundancy imposed by P2S to alleviate its performance issues and inspect regions that influence the noise disproportionately. Specifically this study makes a three-fold contribution: (1) We present Patch2Self2 (P2S2) a method that uses matrix sketching to perform self-supervised denoising. By solving a sub-problem on a smaller sub-space so called coreset we show how P2S2 can yield a significant speedup in training time while using less memory. (2) We present a theoretical analysis of P2S2 focusing on determining the optimal sketch size through rank estimation a key step in achieving a balance between denoising accuracy and computational efficiency. (3) We show how the so-called statistical leverage scores can be used to interpret the denoising of dMRI data a process that was traditionally treated as a black-box. Experimental results on both simulated and real data affirm that P2S2 maintains denoising quality while significantly enhancing speed and memory efficiency achieved by training on a reduced data subset."},

In contrast to image-based methods that measure the quality of downscaled images ours is process-based that draws ideas from rate-distortion theory to measure the distortion incurred during downscaling. Our main idea is that downscaling and super-resolution (SR) can be viewed as the encoding and decoding processes in the rate-distortion model respectively and that a downscaling algorithm that preserves more details in the resulting low-resolution (LR) images should lead to less distorted high-resolution (HR) images in SR. In other words the distortion should increase as the downscaling algorithm deteriorates. However it is non-trivial to measure this distortion as it requires the SR algorithm to be blind and stochastic. Our key insight is that such requirements can be met by recent SR algorithms based on deep generative models that can find all matching HR images for a given LR image on their learned image manifolds. Extensive experimental results show the effectiveness of our IDA-RD measure."},

Such methods are employed to perceive the vehicle surroundings given sensor data. 3D LiDAR sensors are commonly used to collect sparse 3D point clouds from the scene. However compared to human perception such systems struggle to deduce the unseen parts of the scene given those sparse point clouds. In this matter the scene completion task aims at predicting the gaps in the LiDAR measurements to achieve a more complete scene representation. Given the promising results of recent diffusion models as generative models for images we propose extending them to achieve scene completion from a single 3D LiDAR scan. Previous works used diffusion models over range images extracted from LiDAR data directly applying image-based diffusion methods. Distinctly we propose to directly operate on the points reformulating the noising and denoising diffusion process such that it can efficiently work at scene scale. Together with our approach we propose a regularization loss to stabilize the noise predicted during the denoising process. Our experimental evaluation shows that our method can complete the scene given a single LiDAR scan as input producing a scene with more details compared to state-of-the-art scene completion methods.

Our DiffusionTrack possesses two appealing properties: 1) It follows a novel noise-to-target tracking paradigm that leverages multiple denoising diffusion steps to localize the target in a dynamic searching manner per frame. 2) It models the diffusion process using a point set representation which can better handle appearance variations for more precise localization. One side benefit is that DiffusionTrack greatly simplifies the post-processing e.g. removing window penalty scheme.

One challenge of multimodal fusion is that the unimodal data in their unique embedding space mostly contains potential noise which leads to corrupted cross-modal interactions. However in this paper we show that the potential noise in unimodal data could be well quantified and further employed to enhance more stable unimodal embeddings via contrastive learning. Specifically we propose a novel generic and robust multimodal fusion strategy termed Embracing Aleatoric Uncertainty (EAU) which is simple and can be applied to kinds of modalities. It consists of two key steps: (1) the Stable Unimodal Feature Augmentation (SUFA) that learns a stable unimodal representation by incorporating the aleatoric uncertainty into self-supervised contrastive learning. (2) Robust Multimodal Feature Integration (RMFI) leveraging an information-theoretic strategy to learn a robust compact joint representation. We evaluate our proposed EAU method on five multimodal datasets where the video RGB image text audio and depth image are involved. Extensive experiments demonstrate the EAU method is more noise-resistant than existing multimodal fusion strategies and establishes new state-of-the-art on several benchmarks."},

In this paper we propose the first end-to-end framework to recover 3D human poses and shapes from lensless measurements to our knowledge. We specifically design a multi-scale lensless feature decoder to decode the lensless measurements through the optically encoded mask for efficient feature extraction.

In order to identify anchor points we introduce a novel correspondence algorithm that first matches RGB-based pairs then leverages multi-view information and 3D reprojection to robustly filter false positives in two steps. We also introduce a new dataset for exploring the problem of modifying a NeRF scene through a single observation.

Existing dense binary classification methods without proper regularisation of model confidence are prone to being over-confident. To calibrate Deep Neural Networks (DNNs) we propose a Self-Calibrating Vicinal Risk Minimisation (SCVRM) that explores the vicinity space of labeled data where vicinal images that are farther away from labeled images adopt the groundtruth label with decreasing label confidence. We prove that in the logistic regression problem SCVRM can be seen as a Vicinal Risk Minimisation plus a regularisation term that penalises the over-confident predictions. In practical implementation SCVRM is approximated using Monte Carlo sampling that samples additional augmented training images and labels from the vicinal distributions. Experimental results demonstrate that SCVRM can significantly enhance model calibration for different dense classification tasks on both in-distribution and out-of-distribution data.

Specifically DreamComposer first uses a view-aware 3D lifting module to obtain 3D representations of an object from multiple views. Then it renders the latent features of the target view from 3D representations with the multi-view feature fusion module. Finally the target view features extracted from multi-view inputs are injected into a pre-trained diffusion model.

It is clear that the pivotal factor for successful navigation lies in the comprehensive scene understanding. Previous VLN agents employ monocular frameworks to extract 2D features of perspective views directly. Though straightforward they struggle for capturing 3D geometry and semantics leading to a partial and incomplete environment representation. To achieve a comprehensive 3D representation with fine-grained details we introduce a Volumetric Environment Representation (VER) which voxelizes the physical world into structured 3D cells. For each cell VER aggregates multi-view 2D features into such a unified 3D space via 2D-3D sampling. Through coarse-to-fine feature extraction and multi-task learning for VER our agent predicts 3D occupancy 3D room layout and 3D bounding boxes jointly. Based on online collected VERs our agent performs volume state estimation and builds episodic memory for predicting the next step. Experimental results show our environment representations from multi-task learning lead to evident performance gains on VLN. Our model achieves state-of-the-art performance across VLN benchmarks (R2R REVERIE and R4R)."},

Existing methods mitigate this issue with either training with specific designed data or inferencing with external knowledge from other sources incurring inevitable additional costs. In this paper we present OPERA a novel MLLM decoding method grounded in an Over-trust Penalty and a Retrospection-Allocation strategy serving as a nearly free lunch to alleviate the hallucination issue without additional data knowledge or training. Our approach begins with an interesting observation that most hallucinations are closely tied to the knowledge aggregation patterns manifested in the self-attention matrix i.e. MLLMs tend to generate new tokens by focusing on a few summary tokens but not all the previous tokens. Such partial over-trust inclination results in the neglecting of image tokens and describes the image content with hallucination. Based on the observation OPERA introduces a penalty term on the model logits during the beam-search decoding to mitigate the over-trust issue along with a rollback strategy that retrospects the presence of summary tokens in the previously generated tokens and re-allocate the token selection if necessary. With extensive experiments OPERA shows significant hallucination-mitigating performance on different MLLMs and metrics proving its effectiveness and generality.

Martínez", "abstract": "Diffusion models represent a new paradigm in text-to-image generation. Beyond generating high-quality images from text prompts models such as Stable Diffusion have been successfully extended to the joint generation of semantic segmentation pseudo-masks. However current extensions primarily rely on extracting attentions linked to prompt words used for image synthesis. This approach limits the generation of segmentation masks derived from word tokens not contained in the text prompt. In this work we introduce Open-Vocabulary Attention Maps (OVAM)--a training-free method for text-to-image diffusion models that enables the generation of attention maps for any word. In addition we propose a lightweight optimization process based on OVAM for finding tokens that generate accurate attention maps for an object class with a single annotation. We evaluate these tokens within existing state-of-the-art Stable Diffusion extensions. The best-performing model improves its mIoU from 52.1 to 86.6 for the synthetic images' pseudo-masks demonstrating that our optimized tokens are an efficient way to improve the performance of existing methods without architectural changes or retraining."},

Both 2D and 3D diffusion models can help generate decent 3D objects based on prompts. 3D diffusion models have good 3D consistency but their quality and generalization are limited as trainable 3D data is expensive and hard to obtain. 2D diffusion models enjoy strong abilities of generalization and fine generation but 3D consistency is hard to guarantee. This paper attempts to bridge the power from the two types of diffusion models via the recent explicit and efficient 3D Gaussian splatting representation. A fast 3D object generation framework named as GaussianDreamer is proposed where the 3D diffusion model provides priors for initialization and the 2D diffusion model enriches the geometry and appearance. Operations of noisy point growing and color perturbation are introduced to enhance the initialized Gaussians. Our GaussianDreamer can generate a high-quality 3D instance or 3D avatar within 15 minutes on one GPU much faster than previous methods while the generated instances can be directly rendered in real time.

{"title": "Self-Supervised Facial Representation Learning with Facial Region Awareness", "authors": "Zheng Gao, Ioannis Patras", "abstract": "Self-supervised pre-training has been proved to be effective in learning transferable representations that benefit various visual tasks. This paper asks this question: can self-supervised pre-training learn general facial representations for various facial analysis tasks? Recent efforts toward this goal are limited to treating each face image as a whole i.e. learning consistent facial representations at the image-level which overlooks the consistency of local facial representations (i.e. facial regions like eyes nose etc). In this work we make a first attempt to propose a novel self-supervised facial representation learning framework to learn consistent global and local facial representations Facial Region Awareness (FRA). Specifically we explicitly enforce the consistency of facial regions by matching the local facial representations across views which are extracted with learned heatmaps highlighting the facial regions. Inspired by the mask prediction in supervised semantic segmentation we obtain the heatmaps via cosine similarity between the per-pixel projection of feature maps and facial mask embeddings computed from learnable positional embeddings which leverage the attention mechanism to globally look up the facial image for facial regions. To learn such heatmaps we formulate the learning of facial mask embeddings as a deep clustering problem by assigning the pixel features from the feature maps to them. The transfer learning results on facial classification and regression tasks show that our FRA outperforms previous pre-trained models and more importantly using ResNet as the unified backbone for various tasks our FRA achieves comparable or even better performance compared with SOTA methods in facial analysis tasks."},

Our work introduces a novel perspective by tackling this challenge in a contrastive context.

We conducted extensive experiments across a wide variety of scenarios each involving unique combinations of objects attributes and scenes.

Efficient Post-training Quantization (PTQ) is pivotal for addressing these issues in traditional models. Different from traditional models diffusion models heavily depend on the time-step t to achieve satisfactory multi-round denoising. Usually t from the finite set \\ 1 \\ldots T\\  is encoded to a temporal feature by a few modules totally irrespective of the sampling data. However existing PTQ methods do not optimize these modules separately. They adopt inappropriate reconstruction targets and complex calibration methods resulting in a severe disturbance of the temporal feature and denoising trajectory as well as a low compression efficiency. To solve these we propose a Temporal Feature Maintenance Quantization (TFMQ) framework building upon a Temporal Information Block which is just related to the time-step t and unrelated to the sampling data. Powered by the pioneering block design we devise temporal information aware reconstruction (TIAR) and finite set calibration (FSC) to align the full-precision temporal features in a limited time. Equipped with the framework we can maintain the most temporal information and ensure the end-to-end generation quality. Extensive experiments on various datasets and diffusion models prove our state-of-the-art results. Remarkably our quantization approach for the first time achieves model performance nearly on par with the full-precision model under 4-bit weight quantization. Additionally our method incurs almost no extra computational cost and accelerates quantization time by 2.0 xon LSUN-Bedrooms 256 x256 compared to previous works.

Poudel, Harit Pandya, Stephan Liwicki, Roberto Cipolla", "abstract": "While recent model-free Reinforcement Learning (RL) methods have demonstrated human-level effectiveness in gaming environments their success in everyday tasks like visual navigation has been limited particularly under significant appearance variations. This limitation arises from (i) poor sample efficiency and (ii) over-fitting to training scenarios. To address these challenges we present a world model that learns invariant features using (i) contrastive unsupervised learning and (ii) an intervention-invariant regularizer. Learning an explicit representation of the world dynamics i.e. a world model improves sample efficiency while contrastive learning implicitly enforces learning of invariant features which improves generalization. However the naive integration of contrastive loss to world models is not good enough as world-model-based RL methods independently optimize representation learning and agent policy. To overcome this issue we propose an intervention-invariant regularizer in the form of an auxiliary task such as depth prediction image denoising image segmentation etc. that explicitly enforces invariance to style interventions. Our method outperforms current state-of-the-art model-based and model-free RL methods and significantly improves on out-of-distribution point navigation tasks evaluated on the iGibson benchmark. With only visual observations we further demonstrate that our approach outperforms recent language-guided foundation models for point navigation which is essential for deployment on robots with limited computation capabilities. Finally we demonstrate that our proposed model excels at the sim-to-real transfer of its perception module on the Gibson benchmark."},

Davison", "abstract": "Joint camera pose and dense geometry estimation from a set of images or a monocular video remains a challenging problem due to its computational complexity and inherent visual ambiguities. Most dense incremental reconstruction systems operate directly on image pixels and solve for their 3D positions using multi-view geometry cues. Such pixel-level approaches suffer from ambiguities or violations of multi-view consistency (e.g. caused by textureless or specular surfaces). We address this issue with a new image representation which we call a SuperPrimitive. SuperPrimitives are obtained by splitting images into semantically correlated local regions and enhancing them with estimated surface normal directions both of which are predicted by state-of-the-art single image neural networks. This provides a local geometry estimate per SuperPrimitive while their relative positions are adjusted based on multi-view observations. We demonstrate the versatility of our new representation by addressing three 3D reconstruction tasks: depth completion few-view structure from motion and monocular dense visual odometry.

One of the most popular is the Frechet Inception Distance (FID). FID estimates the distance between a distribution of Inception-v3 features of real images and those of images generated by the algorithm. We highlight important drawbacks of FID: Inception's poor representation of the rich and varied content generated by modern text-to-image models incorrect normality assumptions and poor sample complexity. We call for a reevaluation of FID's use as the primary quality metric for generated images. We empirically demonstrate that FID contradicts human raters it does not reflect gradual improvement of iterative text-to-image models it does not capture distortion levels and that it produces inconsistent results when varying the sample size. We also propose an alternative new metric CMMD based on richer CLIP embeddings and the maximum mean discrepancy distance with the Gaussian RBF kernel. It is an unbiased estimator that does not make any assumptions on the probability distribution of the embeddings and is sample efficient. Through extensive experiments and analysis we demonstrate that FID-based evaluations of text-to-image models may be unreliable and that CMMD offers a more robust and reliable assessment of image quality."},

One prominent approach for mitigating this issue is to lift 3D points to 3D lines thereby reducing the effectiveness of the scene inversion attacks but this comes at the cost of increased algorithmic complexity for camera localization due to weaker geometric constraints induced by line clouds. To overcome this limitation we propose a new lifting approach called \"ray cloud\" whereby each lifted 3D line intersects at one of two predefined locations depicting omnidirectional rays from two cameras. This yields two benefits i) camera localization can now be cast as relative pose estimation between the query image and the calibrated rig of two perspective cameras which can be efficiently solved using a variant of the 5-point algorithm and ii) the ray cloud introduces erroneous estimations for the density-based inversion attack degrading the quality of scene recovery. Moreover we explore possible modifications of the inversion attack to better recover scenes from the ray clouds and propose a ray sampling technique to reduce the effectiveness of the modified attack. Experimental results on two public datasets show real-time localization speed as well as enhanced privacy-preserving capability over the state-of-the-art without overly sacrificing the localization accuracy."},

The SVS encodes the geometric appearance and semantic structural information (e.g. classifying trunks branches and leaves) which retains the intricate internal tree features. Tailored to the SVS we present SVDTree a new hybrid tree modeling approach by combining structure-oriented branch reconstruction and self-organization-based foliage reconstruction. We validate SVDTree by using images from both synthetic and real trees.

Prior studies have primarily focused on probing such bias attributes individually while ignoring biases associated with intersections between social attributes.

To address this challenge we employ text-to-image diffusion models to produce counterfactual examples for probing intersectional social biases at scale. Our approach utilizes Stable Diffusion with cross attention control to produce sets of counterfactual image-text pairs that are highly similar in their depiction of a subject (e.g. a given occupation) while differing only in their depiction of intersectional social attributes (e.g. race & gender). Through our over-generate-then-filter methodology we produce SocialCounterfactuals a high-quality dataset containing 171k image-text pairs for probing intersectional biases related to gender race and physical characteristics.

In particular one discriminator is utilized to enable the SR network to learn the distribution of real-world high-quality images in an adversarial training manner. However the distribution learning is overly coarse-grained which is susceptible to virtual textures and causes counter-intuitive generation results. To mitigate this we propose the simple and effective Semantic-aware Discriminator (denoted as SeD) which encourages the SR network to learn the fine-grained distributions by introducing the semantics of images as a condition. Concretely we aim to excavate the semantics of images from a well-trained semantic extractor. Under different semantics the discriminator is able to distinguish the real-fake images individually and adaptively which guides the SR network to learn the more fine-grained semantic-aware textures. To obtain accurate and abundant semantics we take full advantage of recently popular pretrained vision models (PVMs) with extensive datasets and then incorporate its semantic features into the discriminator through a well-designed spatial cross-attention module. In this way our proposed semantic-aware discriminator empowered the SR network to produce more photo-realistic and pleasing images.

Test predictions are made from all classifiers while training only focuses on the current task classifier without holistic alignment leading to Classifier inconsistency. Prompt inconsistency indicates that the prompt selected during testing may not correspond to the one associated with this task during training. In this paper we propose a novel prompt-based method Consistent Prompting (CPrompt) for more aligned training and testing. Specifically all existing classifiers are exposed to prompt training resulting in classifier consistency learning.

Since text prior is important to guarantee the correctness of the restored text structure according to existing arts we also propose a Text Diffusion Model (TDM) for text recognition which can guide IDM to generate text images with correct structures.

For camera-based 3D perception the annotation of 3d bounding relies heavily on LiDAR for accurate depth information. As such the distance of annotation is often limited due to the sparsity of LiDAR points on distant objects which hampers the capability of existing detectors for long-range scenarios. We address this challenge by considering only 2D box supervision for distant objects since they are easy to annotate. We propose LR3D a framework that learns to recover the missing depth of distant objects. LR3D adopts an implicit projection head to learn the generation of mapping between 2D boxes and depth using the 3D supervision on close objects. This mapping allows the depth estimation of distant objects conditioned on their 2D boxes making long-range 3D detection with 2D supervision feasible. Experiments show that without distant 3D annotations LR3D allows camera-based methods to detect distant objects (over 200m) with comparable accuracy to full 3D supervision. Our framework is general and could widely benefit 3D detection methods to a large extent."},

To address these challenges we initially extend the analysis of loss landscapes from the parameter space to the representation space which allows us to simultaneously interpret the transferring and fine-tuning difficulties of CDFSL models. We observe that sharp minima in the loss landscapes of the representation space result in representations that are hard to transfer and fine-tune. Moreover existing flatness-based methods have limited generalization ability due to their short-range flatness. To enhance the transferability and facilitate fine-tuning we introduce a simple yet effective approach to achieve long-range flattening of the minima in the loss landscape. This approach considers representations that are differently normalized as minima in the loss landscape and flattens the high-loss region in the middle by randomly sampling interpolated representations. We implement this method as a new normalization layer that replaces the original one in both CNNs and ViTs. This layer is simple and lightweight introducing only a minimal number of additional parameters. Experimental results on 8 datasets demonstrate that our approach outperforms state-of-the-art methods in terms of average accuracy. Moreover our method achieves performance improvements of up to 9% compared to the current best approaches on individual datasets. Our code will be released."},

Henderson", "abstract": "Single-photon Light Detection and Ranging (LiDAR) systems are often equipped with an array of detectors for improved spatial resolution and sensing speed. However given a fixed amount of flux produced by the laser transmitter across the scene the per-pixel Signal-to-Noise Ratio (SNR) will decrease when more pixels are packed in a unit space. This presents a fundamental trade-off between the spatial resolution of the sensor array and the SNR received at each pixel. Theoretical characterization of this fundamental limit is explored. By deriving the photon arrival statistics and introducing a series of new approximation techniques the Mean Squared Error (MSE) of the maximum-likelihood estimator of the time delay is derived. The theoretical predictions align well with simulations and real data."},

We leverage the emergent knowledge within text-to-image diffusion models towards more robust unsupervised keypoints. Our core idea is to find text embeddings that would cause the generative model to consistently attend to compact regions in images (i.e. keypoints). To do so we simply optimize the text embedding such that the cross-attention maps within the denoising network are localized as Gaussians with small standard deviations. We validate our performance on multiple datasets: the CelebA CUB-200-2011 Tai-Chi-HD DeepFashion and Human3.6m datasets.

Our key idea is that to track a object through frames we can obtain multiple different association results from a model by varying the frames it can observe i.e. skipping frames in observation. As the differences in observations do not alter the identities of objects the obtained association results should be consistent. Based on this rationale we generate multiple observation paths each specifying a different set of frames to be skipped and formulate the Path Consistency Loss that enforces the association results are consistent across different observation paths. We use the proposed loss to train our object matching model with only self-supervision. By extensive experiments on three tracking datasets (MOT17 PersonPath22 KITTI) we demonstrate that our method outperforms existing unsupervised methods with consistent margins on various evaluation metrics and even achieves performance close to supervised methods."},

{"title": "Discontinuity-preserving Normal Integration with Auxiliary Edges", "authors": "Hyomin Kim, Yucheol Jung, Seungyong Lee", "abstract": "Many surface reconstruction methods incorporate normal integration which is a process to obtain a depth map from surface gradients. In this process the input may represent a surface with discontinuities e.g. due to self-occlusion. To reconstruct an accurate depth map from the input normal map hidden surface gradients occurring from the jumps must be handled. To model these jumps correctly we design a novel discretization for the domain of normal integration. Our key idea is to introduce auxiliary edges which bridge between piecewise-smooth planes in the domain so that the magnitude of hidden jumps can be explicitly expressed on finite elements. Using the auxiliary edges we design a novel algorithm to optimize the discontinuity and the depth map from the input normal map. Our method optimizes discontinuities by using a combination of iterative re-weighted least squares and iterative filtering of the jump magnitudes on auxiliary edges to provide strong sparsity regularization. Compared to previous discontinuity-preserving normal integration methods which model the magnitude of jumps only implicitly our method reconstructs subtle discontinuities accurately thanks to our explicit representation allowing for strong sparsity regularization."},

Recent data-driven metrics have demonstrated a stronger correlation with human judgments than classic metrics such as CIDEr; however they lack sufficient capabilities to handle hallucinations and generalize across diverse images and texts partially because they compute scalar similarities merely using embeddings learned from tasks unrelated to image captioning evaluation. In this study we propose Polos a supervised automatic evaluation metric for image captioning models. Polos computes scores from multimodal inputs using a parallel feature extraction mechanism that leverages embeddings trained through large-scale contrastive learning. To train Polos we introduce Multimodal Metric Learning from Human Feedback (M2LHF) a framework for developing metrics based on human feedback. We constructed the Polaris dataset which comprises 131K human judgments from 550 evaluators which is approximately ten times larger than standard datasets. Our approach achieved state-of-the-art performance on Composite Flickr8K-Expert Flickr8K-CF PASCAL-50S FOIL and the Polaris dataset thereby demonstrating its effectiveness and robustness."},

We rigorously proved that such permutation equivariance property can be satisfied on most vanilla Transformer-based models with almost no adaptation. We examine the property over a range of state-of-the-art models including ViT Bert GPT and others with experimental validations.

However as a consequence of the heavy quality degradation of input low-resolution (LR) images the destruction of local structures can lead to ambiguous image semantics. As a result the content of reproduced high-resolution image may have semantic errors deteriorating the super-resolution performance. To address this issue we present a semantics-aware approach to better preserve the semantic fidelity of generative real-world image super-resolution. First we train a degradation-aware prompt extractor which can generate accurate soft and hard semantic prompts even under strong degradation. The hard semantic prompts refer to the image tags aiming to enhance the local perception ability of the T2I model while the soft semantic prompts compensate for the hard ones to provide additional representation information. These semantic prompts encourage the T2I model to generate detailed and semantically accurate results. Furthermore during the inference process we integrate the LR images into the initial sampling noise to mitigate the diffusion model's tendency to generate excessive random details. The experiments show that our method can reproduce more realistic image details and hold better the semantics. The source code of our method can be found at https://github.com/cswry/SeeSR"},

Despite the ill-posed nature of this problem most methods are deterministic and output a single solution often resulting in a lack of geometric detail and blurriness in unseen or uncertain regions. In contrast DiffHuman predicts a probability distribution over 3D reconstructions conditioned on an input 2D image which allows us to sample multiple detailed 3D avatars that are consistent with the image. DiffHuman is implemented as a conditional diffusion model that denoises pixel-aligned 2D observations of an underlying 3D shape representation. During inference we may sample 3D avatars by iteratively denoising 2D renders of the predicted 3D representation. Furthermore we introduce a generator neural network that approximates rendering with considerably reduced runtime (55x speed up) resulting in a novel dual-branch diffusion framework. Our experiments show that DiffHuman can produce diverse and detailed reconstructions for the parts of the person that are unseen or uncertain in the input image while remaining competitive with the state-of-the-art when reconstructing visible surfaces."},

Specifically by forcing vision- language models (VLMs) to answer questions and simultane- ously provide visual evidence we seek to ascertain the extent to which the predictions of such techniques are genuinely anchored in relevant video content versus spurious corre- lations from language or irrelevant visual context. Towards this we construct NExT-GQA - an extension of NExT-QA with 10.5K temporal grounding (or location) labels tied to the original QA pairs. With NExT-GQA we scrutinize a series of state-of-the-art VLMs. Through post-hoc atten- tion analysis we find that these models are extremely weak in substantiating the answers despite their strong QA per- formance. This exposes the limitation of current VLMs in making reliable predictions. As a remedy we further explore and propose a grounded-QA method via Gaussian mask optimization and cross-modal learning. Experiments with different backbones demonstrate that this grounding mechanism improves both grounding and QA. With these efforts we aim to push towards trustworthy VLMs in VQA systems.

O. Cruz, Marc-André Carbonneau", "abstract": "Reconstructing an avatar from a portrait image has many applications in multimedia but remains a challenging research problem. Extracting reflectance maps and geometry from one image is ill-posed: recovering geometry is a one-to-many mapping problem and reflectance and light are difficult to disentangle. Accurate geometry and reflectance can be captured under the controlled conditions of a light stage but it is costly to acquire large datasets in this fashion. Moreover training solely with this type of data leads to poor generalization with in-the-wild images. This motivates the introduction of MoSAR a method for 3D avatar generation from monocular images. We propose a semi-supervised training scheme that improves generalization by learning from both light stage and in-the-wild datasets. This is achieved using a novel differentiable shading formulation. We show that our approach effectively disentangles the intrinsic face parameters producing relightable avatars. As a result MoSAR estimates a richer set of skin reflectance maps and generates more realistic avatars than existing state-of-the-art methods. We also release a new dataset that provides intrinsic face attributes (diffuse specular ambient occlusion and translucency maps) for 10k subjects."},

Then our weather-conditional radar-flow gating network modulates the information flow of fusion features depending on weather conditions and obtains enhanced feature that effectively incorporates the strength of two domains under various weather conditions.

However most existing methods follow an \"adapt then align\" paradigm which adapts pre-trained image encoders to model video-level representations and utilizes one-hot or text embedding of the action labels for supervision. This paradigm overlooks the challenge of mapping from static images to complicated activity concepts. In this paper we propose a novel \"Align before Adapt\" (ALT) paradigm. Prior to adapting to video representation learning we exploit the entity-to-region alignments for each frame. The alignments are fulfilled by matching the region-aware image embeddings to an offline-constructed text corpus. With the aligned entities we feed their text embeddings to a transformer-based video adapter as the queries which can help extract the semantics of the most important entities from a video to a vector. This paradigm reuses the visual-language alignment of VLP during adaptation and tries to explain an action by the underlying entities. This helps understand actions by bridging the gap with complex activity semantics particularly when facing unfamiliar or unseen categories. ALT demonstrates competitive performance while maintaining remarkably low computational costs. In fully supervised experiments it achieves 88.1% top-1 accuracy on Kinetics-400 with only 4947 GFLOPs.

Recently diffusion models have showcased remarkable generative abilities across various domains. They hold promise for human motion generation due to their adaptable many-to-many nature. Nonetheless current diffusion-based motion generation models often create entire motion sequences directly and unidirectionally lacking focus on the motion with local and bidirectional enhancement. When choreographing high-quality dance movements people need to take into account not only the musical context but also the nearby music-aligned dance motions. To authentically capture human behavior we propose a Bidirectional Autoregressive Diffusion Model (BADM) for music-to-dance generation where a bidirectional encoder is built to enforce that the generated dance is harmonious in both the forward and backward directions. To make the generated dance motion smoother a local information decoder is built for local motion enhancement. The proposed framework is able to generate new motions based on the input conditions and nearby motions which foresees individual motion slices iteratively and consolidates all predictions. To further refine the synchronicity between the generated dance and the beat the beat information is incorporated as an input to generate better music-aligned dance movements. Experimental results demonstrate that the proposed model achieves state-of-the-art performance compared to existing unidirectional approaches on the prominent benchmark for music-to-dance generation."},

Tackling this problem is nontrivial due to the semantic mismatches style discrepancies and inevitable distortion of panoramic images. To this end we propose a novel method that utilizes Tangent Projection (TP) as it has less distortion and meanwhile slits the equirectangular projection (ERP) with a fixed FoV to mimic the pinhole images. Both projections are shown effective in extracting knowledge from the source model. However the distinct projection discrepancies between source and target domains impede the direct knowledge transfer; thus we propose a panoramic prototype adaptation module (PPAM) to integrate panoramic prototypes from the extracted knowledge for adaptation. We then impose the loss constraints on both predictions and prototypes and propose a cross-dual attention module (CDAM) at the feature level to better align the spatial and channel characteristics across the domains and projections. Both knowledge extraction and transfer processes are synchronously updated to reach the best performance. Extensive experiments on the synthetic and real-world benchmarks including outdoor and indoor scenarios demonstrate that our method achieves significantly better performance than prior SFUDA methods for pinhole-to-panoramic adaptation."},

Then we devise a knowledge-aware attention mechanism that can update the head node features by learning the joint attention score of each neighbor and edge. Finally we obtain a graph-level embedding through the global pooling process of the updated head serving as an implicit representation for the WSI classification.

In this task difficulty arises often due to three challenges: confusing regions with similar appearance inconsistent object scale and indistinguishable nearby pixels. Recognizing these challenges our paper proposes a novel semantic matching pipeline named LPMFlow toward extracting fine-grained semantics and geometry layouts for building pixel-level semantic correspondences. LPMFlow consists of three modules each addressing one of the aforementioned challenges. The layout-aware representation learning module uniformly encodes source and target tokens to distinguish pixels or regions with similar appearances but different geometry semantics. The progressive feature superresolution module outputs four sets of 4D correlation tensors to generate accurate semantic flow between objects in different scales. Finally the matching flow integration and refinement module is exploited to fuse matching flow in different scales to give the final flow predictions. The whole pipeline can be trained end-to-end with a balance of computational cost and correspondence details. Extensive experiments based on benchmarks such as SPair-71K PF-PASCAL and PF-WILLOW have proved that the proposed method can well tackle the three challenges and outperform the previous methods especially in more stringent settings.

{"title": "Shadow-Enlightened Image Outpainting", "authors": "Hang Yu, Ruilin Li, Shaorong Xie, Jiayan Qiu", "abstract": "Conventional image outpainting methods usually treat unobserved areas as unknown and extend the scene only in terms of semantic consistency thus overlooking the hidden information in shadows cast by unobserved areas such as the invisible shapes and semantics. In this paper we propose to extract and utilize the hidden information of unobserved areas from their shadows to enhance image outpainting. To this end we propose an end-to-end deep approach that explicitly looks into the shadows within the image. Specifically we extract shadows from the input image and identify instance-level shadow regions cast by the unobserved areas. Then the instance-level shadow representations are concatenated to predict the scene layout of each unobserved instance and outpaint the unobserved areas. Finally two discriminators are implemented to enhance alignment between the extended semantics and their shadows. In the experiments we show that our proposed approach provides complementary cues for outpainting and achieves considerable improvement on all datasets by adopting our approach as a plug-in module."},
{"title": "On the Faithfulness of Vision Transformer Explanations", "authors": "Junyi Wu, Weitai Kang, Hao Tang, Yuan Hong, Yan Yan", "abstract": "To interpret Vision Transformers post-hoc explanations assign salience scores to input pixels providing human-understandable heatmaps. However whether these interpretations reflect true rationales behind the model's output is still underexplored. To address this gap we study the faithfulness criterion of explanations: the assigned salience scores should represent the influence of the corresponding input pixels on the model's predictions. To evaluate faithfulness we introduce Salience-guided Faithfulness Coefficient (SaCo) a novel evaluation metric leveraging essential information of salience distribution. Specifically we conduct pair-wise comparisons among distinct pixel groups and then aggregate the differences in their salience scores resulting in a coefficient that indicates the explanation's degree of faithfulness. Our explorations reveal that current metrics struggle to differentiate between advanced explanation methods and Random Attribution thereby failing to capture the faithfulness property. In contrast our proposed SaCo offers a reliable faithfulness measurement establishing a robust metric for interpretations. Furthermore our SaCo demonstrates that the use of gradient and multi-layer aggregation can markedly enhance the faithfulness of attention-based explanation shedding light on potential paths for advancing Vision Transformer explainability."},

The newly initialized 3D modeling module preserves the original feature distribution of the diffusion model exhibiting compatibility with a variety of base diffusion models. Experiments show that EpiDiff generates 16 multiview images in just 12 seconds and it surpasses previous methods in quality evaluation metrics including PSNR SSIM and LPIPS.

This work introduces a novel \"Low-Res Leads the Way\" (LWay) training framework merging Supervised Pre-training with Self-supervised Learning to enhance the adaptability of SR models to real-world images. Our approach utilizes a low-resolution (LR) reconstruction network to extract degradation embeddings from LR images merging them with super-resolved outputs for LR reconstruction. Leveraging unseen LR images for self-supervised learning guides the model to adapt its modeling space to the target domain facilitating fine-tuning of SR models without requiring paired high-resolution (HR) images. The integration of Discrete Wavelet Transform (DWT) further refines the focus on high-frequency details. Extensive evaluations show that our method significantly improves the generalization and detail restoration capabilities of SR models on unseen real-world datasets outperforming existing methods. Our training regime is universally compatible requiring no network architecture modifications making it a practical solution for real-world SR applications."},

However success in tumor synthesis hinges on creating visually realistic tumors that are generalizable across multiple organs and furthermore the resulting AI models being capable of detecting real tumors in images sourced from different domains (e.g. hospitals). This paper made a progressive stride toward generalizable tumor synthesis by leveraging a critical observation: early-stage tumors (< 2cm) tend to have similar imaging characteristics in computed tomography (CT) whether they originate in the liver pancreas or kidneys. We have ascertained that generative AI models e.g. Diffusion Models can create realistic tumors generalized to a range of organs even when trained on a limited number of tumor examples from only one organ. Moreover we have shown that AI models trained on these synthetic tumors can be generalized to detect and segment real tumors from CT volumes encompassing a broad spectrum of patient demographics imaging protocols and healthcare facilities."},

However low-resource problems are under-explored in computer vision. In this paper we address this gap and explore the challenges of low-resource image tasks with vision foundation models. We first collect a benchmark of genuinely low-resource image data covering historic maps circuit diagrams and mechanical drawings. These low-resource settings all share three challenges: data scarcity fine-grained differences and the distribution shift from natural images to the specialized domain of interest. While existing foundation models have shown impressive generalizability we find they cannot transfer well to our low-resource tasks. To begin to tackle the challenges of low-resource vision we introduce one simple baseline per challenge. Specifically we i) enlarge the data space by generative models ii) adopt the best sub-kernels to encode local regions for fine-grained difference discovery and iii) learn attention for specialized domains. Experiments on our three low-resource tasks demonstrate our proposals already provide a better baseline than transfer learning data aug- mentation and fine-grained methods.

It is mainly caused by the characteristic of discriminative models. With the growing popularity of the generative multi-modal models we would explore replacing discriminative models with generative ones for CIL. However transitioning from discriminative to generative models requires addressing two key challenges. The primary challenge lies in transferring the generated textual information into the classification of distinct categories. Additionally it requires formulating the task of CIL within a generative framework. To this end we propose a novel generative multi-modal model (GMM) framework for class incremental learning. Our approach directly generates labels for images using an adapted generative model. After obtaining the detailed text we use a text encoder to extract text features and employ feature matching to determine the most similar label as the classification prediction. In the conventional CIL settings we achieve significantly better results in long-sequence task scenarios. Under the Few-shot CIL setting we have improved by at least 14% over the current state-of-the-art methods with significantly less forgetting."},

Our algorithm determines for each test input which pre-trained models in the model zoo are capable of identifying the test input as an OOD sample. If no such models exist in the model zoo the test input is classified as an in-distribution (ID) sample. We theoretically demonstrate that our method maintains the true positive rate of ID samples and accurately identifies OOD samples with high probability when there are a sufficient number of diverse pre-trained models in the model zoo. Extensive experiments were conducted to validate our method demonstrating that it leverages the complementarity among single-model detectors to consistently improve the effectiveness of OOD sample identification.

Particularly it improves local 3D semantic occupancy predictions by hybrid fusion of (i) semantic and occupancy task features and (ii) compressed orthogonal attention features shared between vehicles. Additionally due to the lack of a collaborative perception dataset designed for semantic occupancy prediction we augment a current collaborative perception dataset to include 3D collaborative semantic occupancy labels for a more robust evaluation. The experimental findings highlight that: (i) our collaborative semantic occupancy predictions excel above the results from single vehicles by over 30% and (ii) models anchored on semantic occupancy outpace state-of-the-art collaborative 3D detection techniques in subsequent perception applications showcasing enhanced accuracy and enriched semantic-awareness in road environments."},

Hence recovering the depth of a textureless object-- for example a large white wall--is not just hard but perhaps even impossible. Or is it? We show that spatial coherence a property of natural light sources can be used to resolve the depth of a scene point even when it is textureless. Our approach relies on the idea that natural light scattered off a scene point is locally coherent with itself while incoherent with the light scattered from other surface points; we use this insight to design an optical setup that uses self-interference as a texture feature for estimating depth. Our lab prototype is capable of resolving the depths of textureless objects in sunlight as well as indoor lights."},

We first propose a semantic guidance network to leverage rich semantic knowledge from a language model as intelligent priors enhancing the functional understanding of real-world instances beyond relying solely on geometrical information. We explicitly instruct the basic instance queries using text embeddings of each instance to learn deep semantic details. Further we utilize the edge prediction module encouraging the segmentation network to be edge-aware. We extract voxel-wise edge maps from point features and use them as auxiliary information for learning edge cues.

Theoretical analysis demonstrates the minimal compression noise of JointSQ and extensive experiments on various network architectures including CNN RNN and Transformer also validate this point.

To meet the recent decentralization trend in the community we introduce a practical yet challenging task Federated GCD (Fed-GCD) where the training data are distributed in local clients and cannot be shared among clients. Fed-GCD aims to train a generic GCD model by client collaboration under the privacy-protected constraint. The Fed-GCD leads to two challenges: 1) representation degradation caused by training each client model with fewer data than centralized GCD learning and 2) highly heterogeneous label spaces across different clients. To this end we propose a novel Associated Gaussian Contrastive Learning (AGCL) framework based on learnable GMMs which consists of a Client Semantics Association (CSA) and a global-local GMM Contrastive Learning (GCL). On the server CSA aggregates the heterogeneous categories of local-client GMMs to generate a global GMM containing more comprehensive category knowledge. On each client GCL builds class-level contrastive learning with both local and global GMMs. The local GCL learns robust representation with limited local data. The global GCL encourages the model to produce more discriminative representation with the comprehensive category relationships that may not exist in local data. We build a benchmark based on six visual datasets to facilitate the study of Fed-GCD. Extensive experiments show that our AGCL outperforms multiple baselines on all datasets."},

Although supervised learning has shown promise in PU its utility is limited in ground-truth (GT) scarce scenarios. This paper presents an unsupervised learning approach that eliminates the need for GTs during end-to-end training. Our approach leverages the insight that both the gradients and wrapped gradients of wrapped phases serve as noisy labels for GT phase gradients along with sparse outliers induced by the wrapping operation. A recorruption-based self-reconstruction loss in the gradient domain is proposed to mitigate the adverse effects of label noise complemented with a self-distillation loss for improved generalization. Additionally by unfolding a variational model of PU that utilizes wrapped gradients of wrapped phases for its data-fitting term we develop a deep unrolling network that encodes physics of phase wrapping and incorporates special treatments on outliers. In the experiments on three types of phase data our approach outperforms existing GT-free methods and competes well against the supervised ones."},

To do that we first extend the EDM framework to take into account spatially and temporally redundant pixels and naturally support video generation. Second we show that a U-Net--a workhorse behind image generation--scales poorly when generating videos requiring significant computational overhead. Hence we propose a new transformer-based architecture that trains 3.31 times faster than U-Nets (and is  4.5 faster at inference).

In this work we present a unifying formalism for PCA and its variants and introduce a framework based on the flags of linear subspaces i.e. a hierarchy of nested linear subspaces of increasing dimension which not only allows for a common implementation but also yields novel variants not explored previously. We begin by generalizing traditional PCA methods that either maximize variance or minimize reconstruction error. We expand these interpretations to develop a wide array of new dimensionality reduction algorithms by accounting for outliers and the data manifold. To devise a common computational approach we recast robust and dual forms of PCA as optimization problems on flag manifolds. We then integrate tangent space approximations of principal geodesic analysis (tangent-PCA) into this flag-based framework creating novel robust and dual geodesic PCA variations. The remarkable flexibility offered by the `flagification' introduced here enables even more algorithmic variants identified by specific flag types. Last but not least we propose an effective convergent solver for these flag-formulations employing the Stiefel manifold. Our empirical results on both real-world and synthetic scenarios demonstrate the superiority of our novel algorithms especially in terms of robustness to outliers on manifolds."},

Unlike existing methods that only take spatial information of the raw data into account we regard point cloud upsampling as generating dense point clouds from deformable topology. Motivated by this we present SPU-PMD a self-supervised topological mesh deformation network for 3D densification. As a cascaded framework our architecture is formulated by a series of coarse mesh interpolator and mesh deformers. At each stage the mesh interpolator first produces the initial dense point clouds via mesh interpolation which allows the model to perceive the primitive topology better. Meanwhile the deformer infers the morphing by estimating the movements of mesh nodes and reconstructs the descriptive topology structure. By associating mesh deformation with feature expansion this module progressively refines point clouds' surface uniformity and structural details.

The alignment between 3D scene graphs is the first step of many downstream tasks such as scene graph aided point cloud registration mosaicking overlap checking and robot navigation. In this work we treat 3D scene graph alignment as a partial graph-matching problem and propose to solve it with a graph neural network. We reuse the geometric features learned by a point cloud registration method and associate the clustered point-level geometric features with the node-level semantic feature via our designed feature fusion module. Partial matching is enabled by using a learnable method to select the top-k similar node pairs. Subsequent downstream tasks such as point cloud registration are achieved by running a pre-trained registration network within the matched regions. We further propose a point-matching rescoring method that uses the node-wise alignment of the 3D scene graph to reweight the matching candidates from a pre-trained point cloud registration method. It reduces the false point correspondences estimated especially in low-overlapping cases. Experiments show that our method improves the alignment accuracy by 10 20% in low-overlap and random transformation scenarios and outperforms the existing work in multiple downstream tasks.

Narasimhan", "abstract": "Adding artificial patterns to objects like QR codes can ease tasks such as object tracking robot navigation and conveying information (e.g. a label or a website link). However these patterns require a physical application and they alter the object's appearance. Conversely projected patterns can temporarily change the object's appearance aiding tasks like 3D scanning and retrieving object textures and shading. However projected patterns impede dynamic tasks like object tracking because they do not `stick' to the object's surface. Or do they? This paper introduces a novel approach combining the advantages of projected and persistent physical patterns. Our system projects heat patterns using a laser beam (similar in spirit to a LIDAR) which a thermal camera observes and tracks. Such thermal patterns enable tracking poorly-textured objects whose tracking is highly challenging with standard cameras while not affecting the object's appearance or physical properties. To avail these thermal patterns in existing vision frameworks we train a network to reverse heat diffusion's effects and remove inconsistent pattern points between different thermal frames. We prototyped and tested this approach on dynamic vision tasks like structure from motion optical flow and object tracking of everyday textureless objects."},

The applications of listener agent generation in virtual interaction have promoted many works achieving diverse and fine-grained motion generation. However they can only manipulate motions through simple emotional labels but cannot freely control the listener's motions. Since listener agents should have human-like attributes (e.g. identity personality) which can be freely customized by users this limits their realism. In this paper we propose a user-friendly framework called CustomListener to realize the free-form text prior guided listener generation. To achieve speaker-listener coordination we design a Static to Dynamic Portrait module (SDP) which interacts with speaker information to transform static text into dynamic portrait token with completion rhythm and amplitude information. To achieve coherence between segments we design a Past Guided Generation module (PGG) to maintain the consistency of customized listener attributes through the motion prior and utilize a diffusion-based structure conditioned on the portrait token and the motion prior to realize the controllable generation.

A critical hurdle in this endeavor is preventing overfitting to the limited classes seen during training the few-shot segmentation model. As our main discovery we find that the concept of \"relationship descriptors\" initially conceived for enhancing the CLIP model for zero-shot semantic segmentation offers a potential solution. We adapt and refine this concept to craft a relationship descriptor construction tailored for few-shot semantic segmentation extending its application across multiple layers to enhance performance. Building upon this adaptation we proposed a few-shot semantic segmentation framework that is not only easy to implement and train but also effectively scales with the number of support examples and categories. Through rigorous experimentation across various datasets including PASCAL-5^ i  and COCO-20^ i  we demonstrate a clear advantage of our method in diverse few-shot semantic segmentation scenarios and a range of pre-trained vision transformer models.

{"title": "Contrastive Learning for DeepFake Classification and Localization via Multi-Label Ranking", "authors": "Cheng-Yao Hong, Yen-Chi Hsu, Tyng-Luh Liu", "abstract": "We propose a unified approach to simultaneously addressing the conventional setting of binary deepfake classification and a more challenging scenario of uncovering what facial components have been forged as well as the exact order of the manipulations. To solve the former task we consider multiple instance learning (MIL) that takes each image as a bag and its patches as instances. A positive bag corresponds to a forged image that includes at least one manipulated patch (i.e. a pixel in the feature map). The formulation allows us to estimate the probability of an input image being a fake one and establish the corresponding contrastive MIL loss. On the other hand tackling the component-wise deepfake problem can be reduced to solving multi-label prediction but the requirement to recover the manipulation order further complicates the learning task into a multi-label ranking problem. We resolve this difficulty by designing a tailor-made loss term to enforce that the rank order of the predicted multi-label probabilities respects the ground-truth order of the sequential modifications of a deepfake image. Through extensive experiments and comparisons with other relevant techniques we provide extensive results and ablation studies to demonstrate that the proposed method is an overall more comprehensive solution to deepfake detection."},

However the heterogeneous traffic density on interactions which caused by physical laws social norms and so on is often overlooked in existing methods. When the density varies the number of agents involved in interactions and the corresponding interaction probability change dynamically. To tackle this issue we propose a new method called \\underline D ensity-\\underline A daptive Model based on \\underline M otif \\underline M atrix for Multi-Agent Trajectory Prediction (DAMM) to gain insights into multi-agent systems. Here we leverage the motif matrix to represent dynamic connectivity in a higher-order pattern and distill the interaction information from the perspectives of the spatial and the temporal dimensions. Specifically in spatial dimension we utilize multi-scale feature fusion to adaptively select the optimal range of neighbors participating in interactions for each time slot. In temporal dimension we extract the temporal interaction features and adapt a pyramidal pooling layer to generate the interaction probability for each agent. Experimental results demonstrate that our approach surpasses state-of-the-art methods on autonomous driving dataset."},
{"title": "Depth Information Assisted Collaborative Mutual Promotion Network for Single Image Dehazing", "authors": "Yafei Zhang, Shen Zhou, Huafeng Li", "abstract": "Recovering a clear image from a single hazy image is an open inverse problem. Although significant research progress has been made most existing methods ignore the effect that downstream tasks play in promoting upstream dehazing. From the perspective of the haze generation mechanism there is a potential relationship between the depth information of the scene and the hazy image. Based on this we propose a dual-task collaborative mutual promotion framework to achieve the dehazing of a single image. This framework integrates depth estimation and dehazing by a dual-task interaction mechanism and achieves mutual enhancement of their performance. To realize the joint optimization of the two tasks an alternative implementation mechanism with the difference perception is developed. On the one hand the difference perception between the depth maps of the dehazing result and the ideal image is proposed to promote the dehazing network to pay attention to the non-ideal areas of the dehazing. On the other hand by improving the depth estimation performance in the difficult-to-recover areas of the hazy image the dehazing network can explicitly use the depth information of the hazy image to assist the clear image recovery. To promote the depth estimation we propose to use the difference between the dehazed image and the ground truth to guide the depth estimation network to focus on the dehazed unideal areas. It allows dehazing and depth estimation to leverage their strengths in a mutually reinforcing manner. Experimental results show that the proposed method can achieve better performance than that of the state-of-the-art approaches. The source code is released at https://github.com/zhoushen1/DCMPNet."},

In recent advancements two-stage detectors have taken a prominent position. However they are encumbered by two primary challenges. First the misalignment between feature representation and relation reasoning gives rise to a deficiency in discriminative features crucial for interaction detection. Second due to sparse annotation the second-stage interaction head generates numerous candidate <human object> pairs with only a small fraction receiving supervision. Towards these issues we propose a hybrid learning method based on pose-aware HOI feature refinement. Specifically we devise pose-aware feature refinement that encodes spatial features by considering human body pose characteristics. It can direct attention towards key regions ultimately offering a wealth of fine-grained features imperative for HOI detection. Further we introduce a hybrid learning method that combines HOI triplets with probabilistic soft labels supervision which is regenerated from decoupled verb-object pairs. This method explores the implicit connections between the interactions enhancing model generalization without requiring additional data. Our method establishes state-of-the-art performance on HICO-DET benchmark and excels notably in detecting rare HOIs."},

Federated Domain Generalization (FedDG) attempts to train a global model using collaborative clients in a privacy-preserving manner that can generalize well to unseen clients possibly with domain shift. However most existing FedDG methods either cause additional privacy risks of data leakage or induce significant costs in client communication and computation which are major concerns in the Federated Learning paradigm. To circumvent these challenges here we introduce a novel architectural method for FedDG namely gPerXAN which relies on a normalization scheme working with a guiding regularizer. In particular we carefully design Personalized eXplicitly Assembled Normalization to enforce client models selectively filtering domain-specific features that are biased towards local data while retaining discrimination of those features. Then we incorporate a simple yet effective regularizer to guide these models in directly capturing domain-invariant representations that the global model's classifier can leverage. Extensive experimental results on two benchmark datasets i.e. PACS and Office-Home and a real-world medical dataset Camelyon17 indicate that our proposed method outperforms other existing methods in addressing this particular problem."},

In this paper we first identify a granularity gap between generic and fine-grained datasets for unsupervised hashing methods highlighting the inadequacy of conventional self-supervised learning for fine-grained visual objects. To bridge this gap we propose the Asymmetric Augmented Self-Supervised Learning (A^2-SSL) method comprising three modules. The asymmetric augmented SSL module employs suitable augmentation strategies for positive/negative views preventing fine-grained category confusion inherent in conventional SSL. Part-oriented dense contrastive learning utilizes the Fisher Vector framework to capture and model fine-grained object parts enhancing unsupervised representations through part-level dense contrastive learning. Self-consistent hash code learning introduces a reconstruction task aligned with the self-consistency principle guiding the model to emphasize comprehensive features particularly fine-grained patterns. Experimental results on five benchmark datasets demonstrate the superiority of A^2-SSL over existing methods affirming its efficacy in unsupervised fine-grained image hashing."},

Despite increasing advancement in detection recognizing subtle and intricate interactions remains challenging. Recent methods have endeavored to leverage the rich semantic representation from pre-trained CLIP yet fail to efficiently capture finer-grained spatial features that are highly informative for interaction discrimination. In this work instead of solely using representations from CLIP we fill the gap by proposing a spatial adapter that efficiently utilizes the multi-scale spatial information in the pre-trained detector. This leads to a bilateral adaptation that mutually produces complementary features. To further improve interaction recognition under occlusion which is common in crowded scenarios we propose an Occluded Part Extrapolation module that guides the model to recover the spatial details from manually occluded feature maps. Moreover we design a Conditional Contextual Mining module that further mines informative contextual clues from the spatial features via a tailored cross-attention mechanism. Extensive experiments on V-COCO and HICO-DET benchmarks demonstrate that our method significantly outperforms prior art on both standard and zero-shot settings resulting in new state-of-the-art performance.

However we observe that the speed and accuracy of YOLOs are negatively affected by the NMS. Recently end-to-end Transformer-based detectors (DETRs) have provided an alternative to eliminating NMS. Nevertheless the high computational cost limits their practicality and hinders them from fully exploiting the advantage of excluding NMS. In this paper we propose the Real-Time DEtection TRansformer (RT-DETR) the first real-time end-to-end object detector to our best knowledge that addresses the above dilemma. We build RT-DETR in two steps drawing on the advanced DETR: first we focus on maintaining accuracy while improving speed followed by maintaining speed while improving accuracy. Specifically we design an efficient hybrid encoder to expeditiously process multi-scale features by decoupling intra-scale interaction and cross-scale fusion to improve speed. Then we propose the uncertainty-minimal query selection to provide high-quality initial queries to the decoder thereby improving accuracy. In addition RT-DETR supports flexible speed tuning by adjusting the number of decoder layers to adapt to various scenarios without retraining. Our RT-DETR-R50 / R101 achieves 53.1% / 54.3% AP on COCO and 108 / 74 FPS on T4 GPU outperforming previously advanced YOLOs in both speed and accuracy. We also develop scaled RT-DETRs that outperform the lighter YOLO detectors (S and M models). Furthermore RT-DETR-R50 outperforms DINO-R50 by 2.2% AP in accuracy and about 21 times in FPS.

This is mainly because generic category-specified VS tasks need to detect all objects and track them across consecutive frames while prompt-guided VS tasks require re-identifying the target with visual/text prompts throughout the entire video making it hard to handle the different tasks with the same architecture. We make an attempt to address these issues and present a novel unified VS architecture namely UniVS by using prompts as queries. UniVS averages the prompt features of the target from previous frames as its initial query to explicitly decode masks and introduces a target-wise prompt cross-attention layer in the mask decoder to integrate prompt features in the memory pool. By taking the predicted masks of entities from previous frames as their visual prompts UniVS converts different VS tasks into prompt-guided target segmentation eliminating the heuristic inter-frame matching process. Our framework not only unifies the different VS tasks but also naturally achieves universal training and testing ensuring robust performance across different scenarios. UniVS shows a commendable balance between performance and universality on 10 challenging VS benchmarks covering video instance semantic panoptic object and referring segmentation tasks.

Yet a central challenge in UDF-based volume rendering is formulating a proper way to convert unsigned distance values into volume density ensuring that the resulting weight function remains unbiased and sensitive to occlusions. Falling short on these requirements often results in incorrect topology or large reconstruction errors in resulting models. This paper addresses this challenge by presenting a novel two-stage algorithm 2S-UDF for learning a high-quality UDF from multi-view images. Initially the method applies an easily trainable density function that while slightly biased and transparent aids in coarse reconstruction. The subsequent stage then refines the geometry and appearance of the object to achieve a high-quality reconstruction by directly adjusting the weight function used in volume rendering to ensure that it is unbiased and occlusion-aware. Decoupling density and weight in two stages makes our training stable and robust distinguishing our technique from existing UDF learning approaches. Evaluations on the DeepFashion3D DTU and BlendedMVS datasets validate the robustness and effectiveness of our proposed approach. In both quantitative metrics and visual quality the results indicate our superior performance over other UDF learning techniques in reconstructing 3D non-watertight models from multi-view images.

While this simplicity is attractive it is necessary to train such models on large and varied datasets which are difficult to capture. It has been shown that using embeddings from pre-trained foundational models such as CLIP improves zero shot transfer in several applications. Taking inspiration from this in our paper we explore the use of global image priors generated from a pre-trained ViT model to provide more detailed contextual information. We argue that the embedding vector from a ViT model pre-trained on a large dataset captures greater relevant information for SIDE than the usual route of generating pseudo image captions followed by CLIP based text embeddings. Based on this idea we propose a new SIDE model using a diffusion backbone which is conditioned on ViT embeddings. Our proposed design establishes a new state-of-the-art (SOTA) for SIDE on NYUv2 dataset achieving Abs Rel error of 0.059(14% improvement) compared to 0.069 by the current SOTA (VPD).

Inspired by influence functions the proposed method forges protective watermarks on more important pixels for these reference images from both heuristic and statistical perspectives. In this way the personal semantics of these images are under protection even if these images are modified to some extent.

To address the above problem this paper proposes a one-class prompt learning method for few-shot anomaly detection termed PromptAD.

Furthermore to mitigate the training challenge caused by the absence of anomaly images we introduce the concept of explicit anomaly margin which is used to explicitly control the margin between normal prompt features and anomaly prompt features through a hyper-parameter.

In this paper we propose to learn a hyperbolic scaling of the unsigned distance field which defines a new Eikonal problem with distinct boundary conditions. This allows our formulation to integrate seamlessly with state-of-the-art continuously differentiable implicit neural representation networks largely applied in the literature to represent signed distance fields. Our approach not only addresses the challenge of open surface representation but also demonstrates significant improvement in reconstruction quality and training performance. Moreover the unlocked field's differentiability allows the accurate computation of essential topological properties such as normal directions and curvatures pervasive in downstream tasks such as rendering.

These issues can be traced back to two pivotal factors: unavoidable motion errors and misalignment in supervision. In practice motion estimates often prove to be error-prone resulting in misaligned features. Furthermore the reconstruction loss tends to bring blurry results particularly in misaligned regions. To mitigate these challenges we propose a new paradigm called PerVFI (Perception-oriented Video Frame Interpolation). Our approach incorporates an Asymmetric Synergistic Blending module (ASB) that utilizes features from both sides to synergistically blend intermediate features. One reference frame emphasizes primary content while the other contributes complementary information. To impose a stringent constraint on the blending process we introduce a self-learned sparse quasi-binary mask which effectively mitigates ghosting and blur artifacts in the output. Additionally we employ a normalizing flow-based generator and utilize the negative log-likelihood loss to learn the conditional distribution of the output which further facilitates the generation of clear and fine details.

Simultaneously PUDM aligns with a dual mapping paradigm to further improve the discernment of point features. In this context PUDM enables learning complex geometry details in the ground truth through the dominant features while avoiding an additional upsampling module design. Furthermore to generate high-quality arbitrary-scale point clouds during inference PUDM exploits the prior knowledge of the scale between sparse point clouds and dense point clouds during training by parameterizing a rate factor.

This mismatch particularly when non-co-occurring elements are masked undermines the training of conventional VLM objectives like Masked Language Modeling and Masked Image Modeling thereby hindering the model's ability to accurately align fine-grained visual and textual features. Addressing this problem we propose Synchronized attentional Masking (SyncMask) which generate masks that pinpoint the image patches and word tokens where the information co-occur in both image and text. This synchronization is accomplished by harnessing cross-attentional features obtained from a momentum model ensuring a precise alignment between the two modalities.

To deal with online 3D scene per- ception tasks where data collection and perception should be performed simultaneously the model should be able to process 3D scenes frame by frame and make use of the temporal information. To this end we propose an adapter-based plug-and-play module for the backbone of 3D scene perception model which constructs memory to cache and aggregate the extracted RGB-D features to empower offline models with temporal learning ability. Specifically we propose a queued memory mechanism to cache the supporting point cloud and image features. Then we devise aggregation modules which directly perform on the memory and pass temporal information to current frame. We further propose 3D-to-2D adapter to enhance image features with strong global context.

We systematically evaluate LLMs' abilities to generate and recognize an assortment of visual concepts of increasing complexity and then demonstrate how a preliminary visual representation learning system can be trained using models of text. As language models lack the ability to consume or output visual information as pixels we use code to represent images in our study. Although LLM-generated images do not look like natural images results on image generation and the ability of models to correct these generated images indicate that precise modeling of strings can teach language models about numerous aspects of the visual world. Furthermore experiments on self-supervised visual representation learning utilizing images generated with text models highlight the potential to train vision models capable of making semantic assessments of natural images using just LLMs."},

Building on the foundation of its predecessor ARTrackV2 extends the concept by introducing a unified generative framework to \"read out\" object's trajectory and \"retell\" its appearance in an autoregressive manner. This approach fosters a time-continuous methodology that models the joint evolution of motion and visual features guided by previous estimates. Furthermore ARTrackV2 stands out for its efficiency and simplicity obviating the less efficient intra-frame autoregression and hand-tuned parameters for appearance updates. Despite its simplicity ARTrackV2 achieves state-of-the-art performance on prevailing benchmark datasets while demonstrating a remarkable efficiency improvement. In particular ARTrackV2 achieves an AO score of 79. 5% on GOT-10k and an AUC of 86. 1% on TrackingNet while being 3.6 xfaster than ARTrack."},

Little", "abstract": "The emergence of attention-based transformer models has led to their extensive use in various tasks due to their superior generalization and transfer properties. Recent research has demonstrated that such models when prompted appropriately are excellent for few-shot inference. However such techniques are under-explored for dense prediction tasks like semantic segmentation. In this work we examine the effectiveness of prompting a transformer-decoder with learned visual prompts for the generalized few-shot segmentation (GFSS) task. Our goal is to achieve strong performance not only on novel categories with limited examples but also to retain performance on base categories. We propose an approach to learn visual prompts with limited examples. These learned visual prompts are used to prompt a multiscale transformer decoder to facilitate accurate dense predictions. Additionally we introduce a unidirectional causal attention mechanism between the novel prompts learned with limited examples and the base prompts learned with abundant data. This mechanism enriches the novel prompts without deteriorating the base class performance. Overall this form of prompting helps us achieve state-of-the-art performance for GFSS on two different benchmark datasets: COCO-20^i and Pascal-5^i without the need for test-time optimization (or transduction). Furthermore test-time optimization leveraging unlabelled test data can be used to improve the prompts which we refer to as transductive prompt tuning."},

Nascimento", "abstract": "We introduce a lightweight and accurate architecture for resource-efficient visual correspondence. Our method dubbed XFeat (Accelerated Features) revisits fundamental design choices in convolutional neural networks for detecting extracting and matching local features. Our new model satisfies a critical need for fast and robust algorithms suitable to resource-limited devices. In particular accurate image matching requires sufficiently large image resolutions -- for this reason we keep the resolution as large as possible while limiting the number of channels in the network. Besides our model is designed to offer the choice of matching at the sparse or semi-dense levels each of which may be more suitable for different downstream applications such as visual navigation and augmented reality. Our model is the first to offer semi-dense matching efficiently leveraging a novel match refinement module that relies on coarse local descriptors. XFeat is versatile and hardware-independent surpassing current deep learning-based local features in speed (up to 5x faster) with comparable or better accuracy proven in pose estimation and visual localization. We showcase it running in real-time on an inexpensive laptop CPU without specialized hardware optimizations. Code and weights are available at verlab.dcc.ufmg.br/descriptors/xfeat_cvpr24."},

We propose an effective approach that involves two key steps: diversifying the source domain and aligning detections based on class prediction confidence and localization. Firstly we demonstrate that by carefully selecting a set of augmentations a base detector can outperform existing methods for single domain generalization by a good margin. This highlights the importance of domain diversification in improving the performance of object detectors. Secondly we introduce a method to align detections from multiple views considering both classification and localization outputs. This alignment procedure leads to better generalized and well-calibrated object detector models which are crucial for accurate decision-making in safety-critical applications. Our approach is detector-agnostic and can be seamlessly applied to both single-stage and two-stage detectors. To validate the effectiveness of our proposed methods we conduct extensive experiments and ablations on challenging domain-shift scenarios.

Existing approaches primarily utilize a closed-vocabulary and static text embeddings setting. These methods often fall short in effectively handling the ingredients particularly new and diverse ones. In response to these limitations we introduce OVFoodSeg a framework that adopts an open-vocabulary setting and enhances text embeddings with visual context. By integrating vision-language models (VLMs) our approach enriches text embedding with image-specific information through two innovative modules e.g. an image-to-text learner FoodLearner and an Image-Informed Text Encoder. The training process of OVFoodSeg is divided into two stages: the pre-training of FoodLearner and the subsequent learning phase for segmentation. The pre-training phase equips FoodLearner with the capability to align visual information with corresponding textual representations that are specifically related to food while the second phase adapts both the FoodLearner and the Image-Informed Text Encoder for the segmentation task. By addressing the deficiencies of previous models OVFoodSeg demonstrates a significant improvement achieving an 4.9% increase in mean Intersection over Union (mIoU) on the FoodSeg103 dataset setting a new milestone for food image segmentation."},

It entails not only authorizing usage but also ensuring the deployment of models in authorized data domains i.e. making models exclusive to certain target domains. Previous methods necessitate concurrent access to source training data and target unauthorized data when performing IP protection making them risky and inefficient for decentralized private data. In this paper we target a practical setting where only a well-trained source model is available and investigate how we can realize IP protection. To achieve this we propose a novel MAsk Pruning (MAP) framework. MAP stems from an intuitive hypothesis i.e. there are target-related parameters in a well-trained model locating and pruning them is the key to IP protection. Technically MAP freezes the source model and learns a target-specific binary mask to prevent unauthorized data usage while minimizing performance degradation on authorized data. Moreover we introduce a new metric aimed at achieving a better balance between source and target performance degradation. To verify the effectiveness and versatility we have evaluated MAP in a variety of scenarios including vanilla source-available practical source-free and challenging data-free. Extensive experiments indicate that MAP yields new state-of-the-art performance."},

Instead of training a task-specific diffusion model for each new task DNO operates by optimizing the diffusion latent noise of an existing pre-trained text-to-motion model. Given the corresponding latent noise of a human motion it propagates the gradient from the target criteria defined on the motion space through the whole denoising process to update the diffusion latent noise. As a result DNO supports any use cases where criteria can be defined as a function of motion. In particular we show that for motion editing and control DNO outperforms existing methods in both achieving the objective and preserving the motion content. DNO accommodates a diverse range of editing modes including changing trajectory pose joint locations or avoiding newly added obstacles. In addition DNO is effective in motion denoising and completion producing smooth and realistic motion from noisy and partial inputs. DNO achieves these results at inference time without the need for model retraining offering great versatility for any defined reward or loss function on the motion representation."},

While existing methods facilitate high-fidelity customization for individual concepts or a limited pre-defined set of them they fall short of achieving scalability where a single model can seamlessly render countless concepts. In this paper we address a new problem called Modular Customization with the goal of efficiently merging customized models that were fine-tuned independently for individual concepts. This allows the merged model to jointly synthesize concepts in one image without compromising fidelity or incurring any additional computational costs. To address this problem we introduce Orthogonal Adaptation a method designed to encourage the customized models which do not have access to each other during fine-tuning to have orthogonal residual weights. This ensures that during inference time the customized models can be summed with minimal interference. Our proposed method is both simple and versatile applicable to nearly all optimizable weights in the model architecture. Through an extensive set of quantitative and qualitative evaluations our method consistently outperforms relevant baselines in terms of efficiency and identity preservation demonstrating a significant leap toward scalable customization of diffusion models."},

However the generation quality and generalization ability of 3D diffusion models is hindered by the scarcity of high-quality and large-scale 3D datasets. In this paper we present PI3D a framework that fully leverages the pre-trained text-to-image diffusion models' ability to generate high-quality 3D shapes from text prompts in minutes. The core idea is to connect the 2D and 3D domains by representing a 3D shape as a set of Pseudo RGB Images. We fine-tune an existing text-to-image diffusion model to produce such pseudo-images using a small number of text-3D pairs. Surprisingly we find that it can already generate meaningful and consistent 3D shapes given complex text descriptions. We further take the generated shapes as the starting point for a lightweight iterative refinement using score distillation sampling to achieve high-quality generation under a low budget. PI3D generates a single 3D shape from text in only 3 minutes and the quality is validated to outperform existing 3D generative models by a large margin."},

Inspired by clinical diagnostics using the past sampling instances can facilitate the final WSI analysis but it is barely explored in prior technologies. To break free these limitations we integrate the dynamic instance sampling and reinforcement learning into a unified framework to improve the instance selection and feature aggregation forming a novel Dynamic Policy Instance Selection (DPIS) scheme for better and more credible decision-making. Specifically the measurement of feature distance and reward function are employed to boost continuous instance sampling.

The mainstream two-stage frameworks of them perform dense self-attention and select a fraction of queries for sparse cross-attention which is proven effective for improving performance but also introduces a heavy computational burden and high dependence on stable query selection. This paper demonstrates that suboptimal two-stage selection strategies result in scale bias and redundancy due to the mismatch between selected queries and objects in two-stage initialization. To address these issues we propose hierarchical salience filtering refinement which performs transformer encoding only on filtered discriminative queries for a better trade-off between computational efficiency and precision.

Without incorporating extra feedback they are still prone to generate unhelpful hallucinated or harmful responses. Second while the visual instruction tuning data is generally structured in a multi-turn dialogue format the connections and dependencies among consecutive conversational turns are weak. This reduces the capacity for effective multi-turn interactions. To tackle these we propose a novel categorization of the NLF into two key types: critique and refinement. The critique NLF identifies the strengths and weaknesses of the responses and is used to align the LVLMs with human preferences. The refinement NLF offers concrete suggestions for improvement and is adopted to improve the interaction ability of the LVLMs-- which focuses on LVLMs' ability to refine responses by incorporating feedback in multi-turn interactions. To address the non-differentiable nature of NLF we generalize conditional reinforcement learning for training.

{"title": "Dual Pose-invariant Embeddings: Learning Category and Object-specific Discriminative Representations for Recognition and Retrieval", "authors": "Rohan Sarkar, Avinash Kak", "abstract": "In the context of pose-invariant object recognition and retrieval we demonstrate that it is possible to achieve significant improvements in performance if both the category-based and the object-identity-based embeddings are learned simultaneously during training. In hindsight that sounds intuitive because learning about the categories is more fundamental than learning about the individual objects that correspond to those categories. However to the best of what we know no prior work in pose invariant learning has demonstrated this effect. This paper presents an attention-based dual-encoder architecture with specially designed loss functions that optimize the inter- and intra-class distances simultaneously in two different embedding spaces one for the category embeddings and the other for the object level embeddings. The loss functions we have proposed are pose-invariant ranking losses that are designed to minimize the intra-class distances and maximize the inter-class distances in the dual representation spaces. We demonstrate the power of our approach with three challenging multi-view datasets ModelNet-40 ObjectPI and FG3D. With our dual approach for single view object recognition we outperform the previous best by 20.0% on ModelNet40 2.0% on ObjectPI and 46.5% on FG3D. On the other hand for single-view object retrieval we outperform the previous best by 33.7% on ModelNet40 18.8% on ObjectPI and 56.9% on FG3D."},

Existing works primarily focus on improving the generalization ability of static networks. However static networks are unable to dynamically adapt to the diverse variations in different image scenes leading to limited generalization capability. Different scenes exhibit varying levels of complexity and the complexity of images further varies significantly in cross-domain scenarios. In this paper we propose a dynamic object-centric perception network based on prompt learning aiming to adapt to the variations in image complexity. Specifically we propose an object-centric gating module based on prompt learning to focus attention on the object-centric features guided by the various scene prompts. Then with the object-centric gating masks the dynamic selective module dynamically selects highly correlated feature regions in both spatial and channel dimensions enabling the model to adaptively perceive object-centric relevant features thereby enhancing the generalization capability. Extensive experiments were conducted on single-domain generalization tasks in image classification and object detection. The experimental results demonstrate that our approach outperforms state-of-the-art methods which validates the effectiveness and versatility of our proposed method."},

Notably the established COCO benchmark has propelled the development of modern detection and segmentation systems. However the COCO segmentation benchmark has seen comparatively slow improvement over the last decade. Originally equipped with coarse polygon annotations for thing instances it gradually incorporated coarse superpixel annotations for stuff regions which were subsequently heuristically amalgamated to yield panoptic segmentation annotations. These annotations executed by different groups of raters have resulted not only in coarse segmentation masks but also in inconsistencies between segmentation types. In this study we undertake a comprehensive reevaluation of the COCO segmentation annotations. By enhancing the annotation quality and expanding the dataset to encompass 383K images with more than 5.18M panoptic masks we introduce COCONut the COCO Next Universal segmenTation dataset. COCONut harmonizes segmentation annotations across semantic instance and panoptic segmentation with meticulously crafted high-quality masks and establishes a robust benchmark for all segmentation tasks. To our knowledge COCONut stands as the inaugural large-scale universal segmentation dataset verified by human raters. We anticipate that the release of COCONut will significantly contribute to the community's ability to assess the progress of novel neural networks."},

Despite the meaningful semantics generation the existing arts suffer from the semantic discrepancy between the masked and unmasked regions since the semantically dense unmasked texture fails to be completely degraded while the masked regions turn to the pure noise in diffusion process leading to the large discrepancy between them. In this paper we aim to answer how the unmasked semantics guide the texture denoising process; together with how to tackle the semantic discrepancy to facilitate the consistent and meaningful semantics generation. To this end we propose a novel structure-guided diffusion model for image inpainting named StrDiffusion to reformulate the conventional texture denoising process under the structure guidance to derive a simplified denoising objective for image inpainting while revealing: 1) the semantically sparse structure is beneficial to tackle the semantic discrepancy in the early stage while the dense texture generates the reasonable semantics in the late stage; 2) the semantics from the unmasked regions essentially offer the time-dependent structure guidance for the texture denoising process benefiting from the time-dependent sparsity of the structure semantics. For the denoising process a structure-guided neural network is trained to estimate the simplified denoising objective by exploiting the consistency of the denoised structure between masked and unmasked regions. Besides we devise an adaptive resampling strategy as a formal criterion as whether the structure is competent to guide the texture denoising process while regulate their semantic correlations. Extensive experiments validate the merits of StrDiffusion over the state-of-the-arts. Our code is available at https://github.com/htyjers/StrDiffusion."},

Extracting accurate point correspondences is to the center of the problem. Existing approaches usually treat the scene point cloud as a whole overlooking the separation of instances. Therefore point features could be easily polluted by other points from the background or different instances leading to inaccurate correspondences oblivious to separate instances especially in cluttered scenes. In this work we propose MIRETR Multi-Instance REgistration TRansformer a coarse-to-fine approach to the extraction of instance-aware correspondences. At the coarse level it jointly learns instance-aware superpoint features and predicts per-instance masks. With instance masks the influence from outside of the instance being concerned is minimized such that highly reliable superpoint correspondences can be extracted. The superpoint correspondences are then extended to instance candidates at the fine level according to the instance masks. At last an efficient candidate selection and refinement algorithm is devised to obtain the final registrations. Extensive experiments on three public benchmarks demonstrate the efficacy of our approach. In particular MIRETR outperforms the state of the arts by 16.6 points on F1 score on the challenging ROBI benchmark. Code and models are available at https://github.com/zhiyuanYU134/MIRETR"},

However most prior works on multimodal social cues focus predominantly on single-person behaviors or rely on holistic visual representations that are not aligned to utterances in multi-party environments. Consequently they are limited in modeling the intricate dynamics of multi-party interactions. In this paper we introduce three new challenging tasks to model the fine-grained dynamics between multiple people: speaking target identification pronoun coreference resolution and mentioned player prediction. We contribute extensive data annotations to curate these new challenges in social deduction game settings. Furthermore we propose a novel multimodal baseline that leverages densely aligned language-visual representations by synchronizing visual features with their corresponding utterances. This facilitates concurrently capturing verbal and non-verbal cues pertinent to social reasoning.

This strategy offers two significant advantages. a) It allows us to take full advantage of the recent advances in text-to-image models such as Stable Diffusion Midjourney and DALLE to generate photorealistic and highly detailed images. b) Leveraging the generated image the model can allocate less focus to fine-grained appearance details prioritizing the efficient learning of motion dynamics.

However these methods usually ignore the utilization of valuable coding priors inherently embedded in compressed videos such as motion vectors and residual frames which carry abundant temporal and spatial information. To remedy this problem we propose the Coding Priors-Guided Aggregation (CPGA) network to utilize temporal and spatial information from coding priors. The CPGA mainly consists of an inter-frame temporal aggregation (ITA) module and a multi-scale non-local aggregation (MNA) module. Specifically the ITA module aggregates temporal information from consecutive frames and coding priors while the MNA module globally captures spatial information guided by residual frames. In addition to facilitate research in VQE task we newly construct the Video Coding Priors (VCP) dataset comprising 300 videos with various coding priors extracted from corresponding bitstreams.

The main challenges arise from the difficulty in accurately segmenting densely overlapping instances and the high cost of precise mask-level annotations. Existing fully-supervised nuclear instance segmentation methods such as boundary-based methods struggle to capture differences between overlapping instances and thus fail in densely distributed blurry regions. They also face challenges transitioning to point supervision where annotations are simple and effective. Inspired by natural mudslides we propose a universal method called Mudslide that uses simple representations to characterize differences between different instances and can easily be extended from fully-supervised to point-supervised. oncretely we introduce a collapse field and leverage it to construct a force map and initial boundary enabling a distinctive representation for each instance. Each pixel is assigned a collapse force with distinct directions between adjacent instances. Starting from the initial boundary Mudslide executes a pixel-by-pixel collapse along various force directions. Pixels that collapse into the same region are considered as one instance concurrently accounting for both inter-instance distinctions and intra-instance coherence.

Unreasonable step sizes and undesirable parameter updates in the prediction.In this paper we design a novel and symplectic integral-inspired framework named symplectic integral neural network (SINN) which engages symplectic trajectories to optimize the pose representation and employs a stable symplectic operator to alternately model the dynamic context. Specifically we design a Symplectic Representation Encoder that performs on enhanced human pose representation to obtain trajectories on the symplectic manifold ensuring numerical stability based on Hamiltonian mechanics and symplectic spatial splitting algorithm. We further present the Symplectic Temporal Aggregation module in the light of the symplectic temporal splitting algorithm which splits the long-term prediction into multiple accurate short-term predictions generated by a symplectic operator to secure modeling stability.

In order to harness pre-trained diffusion models effectively we introduce a straightforward yet powerful strategy focused on two key aspects: selecting optimal feature layers and utilising visual and textual prompts. For the former we identify which layers are most enriched with information and are best suited for the specific retrieval requirements (category-level or fine-grained). Then we employ visual and textual prompts to guide the model's feature extraction process enabling it to generate more discriminative and contextually relevant cross-modal representations.

It is essential for this task to capture scene-distinguishable affinity among shots by similarity assessment. However most methods relies on ordinary shot-to-shot similarities which may inveigle similar shots into being linked even though they are from different scenes and meanwhile hinder dissimilar shots from being blended into a complete scene. In this paper we propose NeighborNet to inject shot contexts into shot-to-shot similarities through carefully exploring the relations between semantic/temporal neighbors of shots over a local time period. In this way shot-to-shot similarities are remeasured as semantic/temporal neighbor-aware similarities so that NeighborNet can learn context embedding into shot features using graph convolutional network. As a result not only do the learned shot features suppress the affinity among similar shots from different scenes but they also promote the affinity among dissimilar shots in the same scene. Experimental results on public benchmark datasets show that our proposed NeighborNet yields substantial improvements in video scene detection especially outperforms released state-of-the-arts by at least 6% in Average Precision (AP).

A promising approach is to utilize mono audio and corresponding vision to synthesize binaural audio thereby avoiding expensive binaural audio recording.

In this paper we advocate generating binaural audio using fine-grained raw waveform and object-level visual information as guidance. Specifically we propose a Cyclic Locating-and-UPmixing (CLUP) framework that jointly learns visual sounding object localization and binaural audio generation. Visual sounding object localization establishes the correspondence between specific visual objects and sound modalities which provides object-aware guidance to improve binaural generation performance. Meanwhile the spatial information contained in the generated binaural audio can further improve the performance of sounding object localization. In this case visual sounding object localization and binaural audio generation can achieve cyclic learning and benefit from each other.

However recent works have shifted towards a more realistic scenario where tasks have shared classes creating blurred task boundaries. Under this setting although existing approaches could be directly applied challenges like data imbalance and varying class-wise data volumes complicate the critical coreset selection used for replay. To tackle these challenges we introduce DECO (Dual-Enhanced Coreset Selection with Class-wise Collaboration) an approach that starts by establishing a class-wise balanced memory to address data imbalances followed by a tailored class-wise gradient-based similarity scoring system for refined coreset selection strategies with reasonable score guidance to all classes. DECO is distinguished by two main strategies: (1) Collaborative Diverse Score Guidance that mitigates biased knowledge in less-exposed classes through guidance from well-established classes simultaneously consolidating the knowledge in the established classes to enhance overall stability. (2) Adaptive Similarity Score Constraint that relaxes constraints between class types boosting learning plasticity for less-exposed classes and assisting well-established classes in defining clearer boundaries thereby improving overall plasticity. Overall DECO helps effectively identify critical coreset samples improving learning stability and plasticity across all classes. Extensive experiments are conducted on four benchmark datasets to demonstrate the effectiveness and superiority of DECO over other competitors under this online blurry class incremental learning setting."},

To answer this we design a strong regression-based model called ZeroShape based on the converging findings in this field and a novel insight.

Therefore we present ConvoFusion a diffusion-based approach for multi-modal gesture synthesis which can not only generate gestures based on multi-modal speech inputs but can also facilitate controllability in gesture synthesis. Our method proposes two guidance objectives that allow the users to modulate the impact of different conditioning modalities (e.g. audio vs text) as well as to choose certain words to be emphasized during gesturing. Our method is versatile in that it can be trained either for generating monologue gestures or even the conversational gestures.

Unfortunately those studies have primarily focused on pixel-level corruptions thereby lacking the generalization to adapt to a broader range of OOD types. We introduce Generalized Diffusion Adaptation (GDA) a novel diffusion-based test-time adaptation method robust against diverse OOD types. Specifically GDA iteratively guides the diffusion by applying a marginal entropy loss derived from the model in conjunction with style and content preservation losses during the reverse sampling process. In other words GDA considers the model's output behavior and the samples' semantic information as a whole reducing ambiguity in downstream tasks. based adaptation.

Conventional lidar sensors are capable of providing centimeter-accurate distance information by emitting laser pulses into a scene and measuring the time-of-flight (ToF) of the reflection. However the polarization of the received light that depends on the surface orientation and material properties is usually not considered. As such the polarization modality has the potential to improve scene reconstruction beyond distance measurements. In this work we introduce a novel long-range polarization wavefront lidar sensor (PolLidar) that modulates the polarization of the emitted and received light. Departing from conventional lidar sensors PolLidar allows access to the raw time-resolved polarimetric wavefronts. We leverage polarimetric wavefronts to estimate normals distance and material properties in outdoor scenarios with a novel learned reconstruction method. To train and evaluate the method we introduce a simulated and real-world long-range dataset with paired raw lidar data ground truth distance and normal maps. We find that the proposed method improves normal and distance reconstruction by 53% mean angular error and 41% mean absolute error compared to existing shape-from-polarization (SfP) and ToF methods. Code and data are open-sourced here."},

Most existing methods treat semantic prediction as an additional rendering task i.e. the \"label rendering\" task to build semantic NeRFs. However by rendering semantic/instance labels per pixel without considering the contextual information of the rendered image these methods usually suffer from unclear boundary segmentation and abnormal segmentation of pixels within an object. To solve this problem we propose Generalized Perception NeRF (GP-NeRF) a novel pipeline that makes the widely used segmentation model and NeRF work compatibly under a unified framework for facilitating context-aware 3D scene perception. To accomplish this goal we introduce transformers to aggregate radiance as well as semantic embedding fields jointly for novel views and facilitate the joint volumetric rendering of both fields. In addition we propose two self-distillation mechanisms i.e. the Semantic Distill Loss and the Depth-Guided Semantic Distill Loss to enhance the discrimination and quality of the semantic field and the maintenance of geometric consistency. In evaluation as shown in Fig. 1 we conduct experimental comparisons under two perception tasks (i.e. semantic and instance segmentation) using both synthetic and real-world datasets. Notably our method outperforms SOTA approaches by 6.94% 11.76% and 8.47% on generalized semantic segmentation finetuning semantic segmentation and instance segmentation respectively"},

The key is to first learn a part-wise 4D generative model from monocular images via adversarial learning to synthesize multi-view images of diverse identities and full motions as training data; then leverage a transformer-based animatable triplane reconstructor to learn 4D head reconstruction using the synthetic data. A novel learning strategy is enforced to enhance the generalizability to real images by disentangling the learning process of 3D reconstruction and reenactment.

In this work we take a different perspective and propose a novel and simple Transfer Learning-based Defense against Model Inversion (TL-DMI) to render MI-robust models. Particularly by leveraging TL we limit the number of layers encoding sensitive information from private training dataset thereby degrading the performance of MI attack.

While state-of-the-art methods achieve impressive performance they perform a dense perception of images which incorporates redundant visual regions unrelated to linguistic queries leading to additional computational overhead. This inspires us to explore a question: can we eliminate linguistic-irrelevant redundant visual regions to improve the efficiency of the model? Existing relevant methods primarily focus on fundamental visual tasks with limited exploration in vision-language fields. To address this we propose a coarse-to-fine iterative perception framework called ScanFormer. It can iteratively exploit the image scale pyramid to extract linguistic-relevant visual patches from top to bottom. In each iteration irrelevant patches are discarded by our designed informativeness prediction. Furthermore we propose a patch selection strategy for discarded patches to accelerate inference. Experiments on widely used datasets namely RefCOCO RefCOCO+ RefCOCOg and ReferItGame verify the effectiveness of our method which can strike a balance between accuracy and efficiency."},

Existing methods mainly address this issue by retraining diffusion models with images rendered from 3D data to ensure multi-view consistency while struggling to balance 2D generation quality with 3D consistency. In this paper we present a new framework Sculpt3D that equips the current pipeline with explicit injection of 3D priors from retrieved reference objects without re-training the 2D diffusion model. Specifically we demonstrate that high-quality and diverse 3D geometry can be guaranteed by keypoints supervision through a sparse ray sampling approach. Moreover to ensure accurate appearances of different views we further modulate the output of the 2D diffusion model to the correct patterns of the template views without altering the generated object's style. These two decoupled designs effectively harness 3D information from reference objects to generate 3D objects while preserving the generation quality of the 2D diffusion model.

The goal is to design a set of infrared adversarial stickers to make cars invisible to infrared detectors at various viewing angles distances and scenes. We build a 3D infrared car model with real infrared characteristics and propose an infrared adversarial pattern generation method based on 3D mesh shadow. We propose a 3D control points-based mesh smoothing algorithm and use a set of smoothness loss functions to enhance the smoothness of adversarial meshes and facilitate the sticker implementation.

DriveTrack is motivated by the observation that the accuracy of state-of-the-art trackers depends strongly on visual attributes around the selected keypoints such as texture and lighting. The problem is that these artifacts are especially pronounced in real-world videos but these trackers are unable to train on such scenes due to a dearth of annotations. DriveTrack bridges this gap by building a framework to automatically annotate point tracks on autonomous driving datasets. We release a dataset consisting of 1 billion point tracks across 24 hours of video which is seven orders of magnitude greater than prior real-world benchmarks and on par with the scale of synthetic benchmarks. DriveTrack unlocks new use cases for point tracking in real-world videos. First we show that fine-tuning keypoint trackers on DriveTrack improves accuracy on real-world scenes by up to 7%. Second we analyze the sensitivity of trackers to visual artifacts in real scenes and motivate the idea of running assistive keypoint selectors alongside trackers."},

Although great progress has been witnessed we experimentally reveal that current methods reach marginal performance gain within the use of the unlabeled frames leading to the underutilization issue. To fully explore the potential of the unlabeled frames for AVS we explicitly divide them into two categories based on their temporal characteristics i.e. neighboring frame (NF) and distant frame (DF). NFs temporally adjacent to the labeled frame often contain rich motion information that assists in the accurate localization of sounding objects. Contrary to NFs DFs have long temporal distances from the labeled frame which share semantic-similar objects with appearance variations. Considering their unique characteristics we propose a versatile framework that effectively leverages them to tackle AVS. Specifically for NFs we exploit the motion cues as the dynamic guidance to improve the objectness localization. Besides we exploit the semantic cues in DFs by treating them as valid augmentations to the labeled frames which are then used to enrich data diversity in a self-training manner. Extensive experimental results demonstrate the versatility and superiority of our method unleashing the power of the abundant unlabeled frames."},

The first stage is targeted for context-agnostic identity-preserving pretraining of the object encoder enabling the encoder to learn an embedding that is both view-invariant and conducive to enhanced detail preservation. The subsequent stage leverages this representation to learn seamless harmonization of the object composited to the background.

Despite their success LVLMs still suffer from the issue of object hallucinations where models generate plausible yet incorrect outputs that include objects that do not exist in the images. To mitigate this issue we introduce Visual Contrastive Decoding (VCD) a simple and training-free method that contrasts output distributions derived from original and distorted visual inputs. The proposed VCD effectively reduces the over-reliance on statistical bias and unimodal priors two essential causes of object hallucinations. This adjustment ensures the generated content is closely grounded to visual inputs resulting in contextually accurate outputs. Our experiments show that VCD without either additional training or the usage of external tools significantly mitigates the object hallucination issue across different LVLM families. Beyond mitigating object hallucinations VCD also excels in general LVLM benchmarks highlighting its wide-ranging applicability."},

As such we aim to develop a black-box approach to optimize VLMs through  natural language prompts  thereby avoiding the need to access model parameters feature embeddings or even output logits. We propose employing chat-based LLMs to search for the best text prompt for VLMs. Specifically we adopt an automatic \"hill-climbing\" procedure that converges to an effective prompt by evaluating the performance of current prompts and asking LLMs to refine them based on textual feedback all within a conversational process without human-in-the-loop. In a challenging 1-shot image classification setup our simple approach surpasses the white-box continuous prompting method (CoOp) by an average of 1.5% across 11 datasets including ImageNet. Our approach also outperforms both human-engineered and LLM-generated prompts. We highlight the advantage of conversational feedback that incorporates both positive and negative prompts suggesting that LLMs can utilize the implicit \"gradient\" direction in textual feedback for a more efficient search. In addition we find that the text prompts generated through our strategy are not only more interpretable but also transfer well across different VLM architectures in a black-box manner. Lastly we demonstrate our framework on a state-of-the-art black-box VLM (DALL-E 3) for text-to-image optimization."},

In distinction to the traditional paradigm that is limited to predefined categories this setting promises a continual and generalizable way of estimating objectness using class-agnostic information. However achieving such decorrelation between objectness and class information proves challenging. Without explicit consideration existing methods usually exhibit low recall on unknown objects and can misclassify them into known classes. To address this problem we exploit three levels of orthogonality in the detection process: First the objectness and classification heads are disentangled by operating on separate sets of features that are orthogonal to each other in a devised polar coordinate system. Secondly a prediction decorrelation loss is introduced to guide the detector towards more general and class-independent prediction. Furthermore we propose a calibration scheme that helps maintain orthogonality throughout the training process to mitigate catastrophic interference and facilitate incremental learning of previously unseen objects. Our method is comprehensively evaluated on open world and incremental object detection benchmarks demonstrating its effectiveness in detecting both known and unknown objects.

The main challenge of this task is handling the different degradation distributions at once. Existing methods mainly utilize task-specific conditions (e.g. prompt) to guide the model to learn different distributions separately named multi-partite mapping. However it is not suitable for universal model learning as it ignores the shared information between different tasks. In this work we propose an advanced selective hourglass mapping strategy based on diffusion model termed DiffUIR. Two novel considerations make our DiffUIR non-trivial. Firstly we equip the model with strong condition guidance to obtain accurate generation direction of diffusion model (selective). More importantly DiffUIR integrates a flexible shared distribution term (SDT) into the diffusion algorithm elegantly and naturally which gradually maps different distributions into a shared one. In the reverse process combined with SDT and strong condition guidance DiffUIR iteratively guides the shared distribution to the task-specific distribution with high image quality (hourglass). Without bells and whistles by only modifying the mapping strategy we achieve state-of-the-art performance on five image restoration tasks 22 benchmarks in the universal setting and zero-shot generalization setting.

While end-to-end text spotting efficiently mitigates the issues of error accumulation and sub-optimal performance seen in traditional two-step methodologies the two-step methods continue to be favored in many competitions and practical settings due to their superior modularity. In this paper we introduce Bridging Text Spotting a novel approach that resolves the error accumulation and suboptimal performance issues in two-step methods while retaining modularity. To achieve this we adopt a well-trained detector and recognizer that are developed and trained independently and then lock their parameters to preserve their already acquired capabilities. Subsequently we introduce a Bridge that connects the locked detector and recognizer through a zero-initialized neural network.

{"title": "Boosting Adversarial Transferability by Block Shuffle and Rotation", "authors": "Kunyu Wang, Xuanran He, Wenxuan Wang, Xiaosen Wang", "abstract": "Adversarial examples mislead deep neural networks with imperceptible perturbations and have brought significant threats to deep learning. An important aspect is their transferability which refers to their ability to deceive other models thus enabling attacks in the black-box setting. Though various methods have been proposed to boost transferability the performance still falls short compared with white-box attacks. In this work we observe that existing input transformation based attacks one of the mainstream transfer-based attacks result in different attention heatmaps on various models which might limit the transferability. We also find that breaking the intrinsic relation of the image can disrupt the attention heatmap of the original image. Based on this finding we propose a novel input transformation based attack called block shuffle and rotation (BSR). Specifically BSR splits the input image into several blocks then randomly shuffles and rotates these blocks to construct a set of new images for gradient calculation. Empirical evaluations on the ImageNet dataset demonstrate that BSR could achieve significantly better transferability than the existing input transformation based methods under single-model and ensemble-model settings. Combining BSR with the current input transformation method can further improve the transferability which significantly outperforms the state-of-the-art methods.

Some works use high-level conditioning such as text while others use low-level conditioning. Nevertheless most of them lack fine-grained control over the properties of the different objects present in the image i.e. object-level image editing. In this work we tackle the task by perceiving the images as an amalgamation of various objects and aim to control the properties of each object in a fine-grained manner. Out of these properties we identify structure and appearance as the most intuitive to understand and useful for editing purposes. We propose PAIR Diffusion a generic framework that enables a diffusion model to control the structure and appearance properties of each object in the image. We show that having control over the properties of each object in an image leads to comprehensive editing capabilities. Our framework allows for various object-level editing operations on real images such as reference image-based appearance editing free-form shape editing adding objects and variations. Thanks to our design we do not require any inversion step. Additionally we propose multimodal classifier-free guidance which enables editing images using both reference images and text when using our approach with foundational diffusion models. We validate the above claims by extensively evaluating our framework on both unconditional and foundational diffusion models."},

However the recent development of IAD approach has encountered certain difficulties due to dataset limitations. On the one hand most of the state-of-the-art methods have achieved saturation (over 99% in AUROC) on mainstream datasets such as MVTec and the differences of methods cannot be well distinguished leading to a significant gap between public datasets and actual application scenarios. On the other hand the research on various new practical anomaly detection settings is limited by the scale of the dataset posing a risk of overfitting in evaluation results. Therefore we propose a large-scale Real-world and multi-view Industrial Anomaly Detection dataset named Real-IAD which contains 150K high-resolution images of 30 different objects an order of magnitude larger than existing datasets. It has a larger range of defect area and ratio proportions making it more challenging than previous datasets. To make the dataset closer to real application scenarios we adopted a multi-view shooting method and proposed sample-level evaluation metrics. In addition beyond the general unsupervised anomaly detection setting we propose a new setting for Fully Unsupervised Industrial Anomaly Detection (FUIAD) based on the observation that the yield rate in industrial production is usually greater than 60% which has more practical application value. Finally we report the results of popular IAD methods on the Real-IAD dataset providing a highly challenging benchmark to promote the development of the IAD field."},

While previous work mainly focuses on accurately estimating depth or height for 2D-to-3D mapping ignoring the position approximation error in the voxel pooling process. Inspired by this insight we propose a novel voxel pooling strategy to reduce such error dubbed BEVSpread. Specifically instead of bringing the image features contained in a frustum point to a single BEV grid BEVSpread considers each frustum point as a source and spreads the image features to the surrounding BEV grids with adaptive weights. To achieve superior propagation performance a specific weight function is designed to dynamically control the decay speed of the weights according to distance and depth. Aided by customized CUDA parallel acceleration BEVSpread achieves comparable inference time as the original voxel pooling. Extensive experiments on two large-scale roadside benchmarks demonstrate that as a plug-in BEVSpread can significantly improve the performance of existing frustum-based BEV methods by a large margin of (1.12 5.26 3.01) AP in vehicle pedestrian and cyclist."},

{"title": "Learning to Produce Semi-dense Correspondences for Visual Localization", "authors": "Khang Truong Giang, Soohwan Song, Sungho Jo", "abstract": "This study addresses the challenge of performing visual localization in demanding conditions such as night-time scenarios adverse weather and seasonal changes. While many prior studies have focused on improving image matching performance to facilitate reliable dense keypoint matching between images existing methods often heavily rely on predefined feature points on a reconstructed 3D model. Consequently they tend to overlook unobserved keypoints during the matching process. Therefore dense keypoint matches are not fully exploited leading to a notable reduction in accuracy particularly in noisy scenes. To tackle this issue we propose a novel localization method that extracts reliable semi-dense 2D-3D matching points based on dense keypoint matches. This approach involves regressing semi-dense 2D keypoints into 3D scene coordinates using a point inference network. The network utilizes both geometric and visual cues to effectively infer 3D coordinates for unobserved keypoints from the observed ones. The abundance of matching information significantly enhances the accuracy of camera pose estimation even in scenarios involving noisy or sparse 3D models. Comprehensive evaluations demonstrate that the proposed method outperforms other methods in challenging scenes and achieves competitive results in large-scale visual localization benchmarks.

Our approach namely MS-DETR is simple and places one-to-many supervision to the object queries of the primary decoder that is used for inference. In comparison to existing DETR variants with one-to-many supervision such as Group DETR and Hybrid DETR our approach does not need additional decoder branches or object queries. The object queries of the primary decoder in our approach directly benefit from one-to-many supervision and thus are superior in object candidate prediction.

Federated Multi-Task Learning (FMTL) builds on FL to handle multiple tasks assuming model congruity that identical model architecture is deployed in each client. To relax this assumption and thus extend real-world applicability we introduce a novel problem setting Hetero-Client Federated Multi-Task Learning (HC-FMTL) to accommodate diverse task setups. The main challenge of HC-FMTL is the model incongruity issue that invalidates conventional aggregation methods. It also escalates the difficulties in model aggregation to deal with data and task heterogeneity inherent in FMTL. To address these challenges we propose the FedHCA^2 framework which allows for federated training of personalized models by modeling relationships among heterogeneous clients. Drawing on our theoretical insights into the difference between multi-task and federated optimization we propose the Hyper Conflict-Averse Aggregation scheme to mitigate conflicts during encoder updates.

With the success of Vision Transformer (ViT) the migration of ViT is actively conducted in WSSS. This work proposes a novel WSSS framework with Class Token Infusion (CTI). By infusing the class tokens from images we guide class tokens to possess class-specific distinct characteristics and global-local consistency. For this we devise two kinds of token infusion: 1) Intra-image Class Token Infusion (I-CTI) and 2) Cross-Image Class Token Infusion (C-CTI). In I-CTI we infuse the class tokens from the same but differently augmented images and thus make CAMs consistent among various deformations (view color). In C-CTI by infusing the class tokens from the other images and imposing the resulting CAMs to be similar it learns class-specific distinct characteristics. Besides the CTI we bring the background (BG) concept into ViT with the BG token to reduce the false positive activation of CAMs. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our method on PASCAL VOC 2012 and MS COCO 2014 datasets achieving state-of-the-art results in weakly supervised semantic segmentation.

Yet efficiently editing these representations while retaining photorealism is an emerging challenge. Recent methods face three primary limitations: they're slow for interactive use lack precision at object boundaries and struggle to ensure multi-view consistency. We introduce IReNe to address these limitations enabling swift near real-time color editing in NeRF. Leveraging a pre-trained NeRF model and a single training image with user-applied color edits IReNe swiftly adjusts network parameters in seconds. This adjustment allows the model to generate new scene views accurately representing the color changes from the training image while also controlling object boundaries and view-specific effects. Object boundary control is achieved by integrating a trainable segmentation module into the model. The process gains efficiency by retraining only the weights of the last network layer. We observed that neurons in this layer can be classified into those responsible for view-dependent appearance and those contributing to diffuse appearance. We introduce an automated classification approach to identify these neuron types and exclusively fine-tune the weights of the diffuse neurons. This further accelerates training and ensures consistent color edits across different views. A thorough validation on a new dataset with edited object colors shows significant quantitative and qualitative advancements over competitors accelerating speeds by 5x and 500x."},

Correspondingly we propose an end-to-end network for HDR video reconstruction where a novel two-stage strategy is designed to perform alignment sequentially. Specifically the first stage performs global alignment with the adaptively estimated global offsets reducing the difficulty of subsequent alignment. The second stage implicitly performs local alignment in a coarse-to-fine manner at the feature level using the adaptive separable convolution. Extensive experiments demonstrate that: (1) models trained on our dataset can achieve better performance on real scenes than those trained on synthetic datasets; (2) our method outperforms previous state-of-the-art methods.

However a notable limitation of diffusion models in comparison to GANs is their difficulty in smoothly interpolating between two image samples due to their highly unstructured latent space. Such a smooth interpolation is intriguing as it naturally serves as a solution for the image morphing task with many applications. In this work we address this limitation via DiffMorpher an approach that enables smooth and natural image interpolation by harnessing the prior knowledge of a pre-trained diffusion model. Our key idea is to capture the semantics of the two images by fitting two LoRAs to them respectively and interpolate between both the LoRA parameters and the latent noises to ensure a smooth semantic transition where correspondence automatically emerges without the need for annotation. In addition we propose an attention interpolation and injection technique an adaptive normalization adjustment method and a new sampling schedule to further enhance the smoothness between consecutive images. Extensive experiments demonstrate that DiffMorpher achieves starkly better image morphing effects than previous methods across a variety of object categories bridging a critical functional gap that distinguished diffusion models from GANs."},

Despite its potential to revolutionize the mobile industry challenges in various environments such as communication bandwidth limitations localization errors and information aggregation inefficiencies hinder its implementation in practical applications. In this work we propose ERMVP a communication-Efficient and collaboration-Robust Multi-Vehicle Perception method in challenging environments. Specifically ERMVP has three distinct strengths: i) It utilizes the hierarchical feature sampling strategy to abstract a representative set of feature vectors using less communication overhead for efficient communication; ii) It employs the sparse consensus features to execute precise spatial location calibrations effectively mitigating the implications of vehicle localization errors; iii) A pioneering feature fusion and interaction paradigm is introduced to integrate holistic spatial semantics among different vehicles and data sources. To thoroughly validate our method we conduct extensive experiments on real-world and simulated datasets. The results demonstrate that the proposed ERMVP is significantly superior to the state-of-the-art collaborative perception methods."},

In this paper we investigate this task from a few-shot unconstrained photo album. The reconstruction of human avatars from such data sources is challenging because of limited data amount and dynamic articulated poses. For handling dynamic data we integrate a skinning mechanism with deep marching tetrahedra (DMTet) to form a drivable tetrahedral representation which drives arbitrary mesh topologies generated by the DMTet for the adaptation of unconstrained images. To effectively mine instructive information from few-shot data we devise a two-phase optimization method with few-shot reference and few-shot guidance. The former focuses on aligning avatar identity with reference images while the latter aims to generate plausible appearances for unseen regions. Overall our framework called HaveFun can undertake avatar reconstruction rendering and animation. Extensive experiments on our developed benchmarks demonstrate that HaveFun exhibits substantially superior performance in reconstructing the human body and hand."},

Current state-of-the-art methods develop Transformer-based implicit field learning necessitating an intensive learning paradigm that requires dense query-supervision uniformly sampled throughout the entire space. We propose a novel approach IPoD which harmonizes implicit field learning with point diffusion. This approach treats the query points for implicit field learning as a noisy point cloud for iterative denoising allowing for their dynamic adaptation to the target object shape. Such adaptive query points harness diffusion learning's capability for coarse shape recovery and also enhances the implicit representation's ability to delineate finer details. Besides an additional self-conditioning mechanism is designed to use implicit predictions as the guidance of diffusion learning leading to a cooperative system. Experiments conducted on the CO3D-v2 dataset affirm the superiority of IPoD achieving 7.8% improvement in F-score and 28.6% in Chamfer distance over existing methods.

However the lack of high-level semantics in pre-training still heavily hinders the performance of downstream tasks. We observe that 3D medical images contain relatively consistent contextual position information i.e. consistent geometric relations between different organs which leads to a potential way for us to learn consistent semantic representations in pre-training. In this paper we propose a simple-yet-effective Volume Contrast (VoCo) framework to leverage the contextual position priors for pre-training. Specifically we first generate a group of base crops from different regions while enforcing feature discrepancy among them where we employ them as class assignments of different regions. Then we randomly crop sub-volumes and predict them belonging to which class (located at which region) by contrasting their similarity to different base crops which can be seen as predicting contextual positions of different sub-volumes. Through this pretext task VoCo implicitly encodes the contextual position priors into model representations without the guidance of annotations enabling us to effectively improve the performance of downstream tasks that require high-level semantics. Extensive experimental results on six downstream tasks demonstrate the superior effectiveness of VoCo. Code will be available at https://github.com/Luffy03/VoCo."},

Yao, Belinda Zeng, Mubarak Shah, Trishul Chilimbi", "abstract": "In this paper we propose VidLA an approach for video-language alignment at scale. There are two major limitations of previous video-language alignment approaches. First they do not capture both short-range and long-range temporal dependencies and typically employ complex hierarchical deep network architectures that are hard to integrate with existing pretrained image-text foundation models. To effectively address this limitation we instead keep the network architecture simple and use a set of data tokens that operate at different temporal resolutions in a hierarchical manner accounting for the temporally hierarchical nature of videos. By employing a simple two-tower architecture we are able to initialize our video-language model with pretrained image-text foundation models thereby boosting the final performance. Second existing video-language alignment works struggle due to the lack of semantically aligned large-scale training data. To overcome it we leverage recent LLMs to curate the largest video-language dataset to date with better visual grounding. Furthermore unlike existing video-text datasets which only contain short clips our dataset is enriched with video clips of varying durations to aid our temporally hierarchical data tokens in extracting better representations at varying temporal scales. Overall empirical results show that our proposed approach surpasses state-of-the-art methods on multiple retrieval benchmarks especially on longer videos and performs competitively on classification benchmarks."},

To overcome this challenge we propose a novel zero-shot tone mapping framework that utilizes shared structure knowledge allowing us to transfer a pre-trained mapping model from the LDR domain to HDR fields without paired training data. Our approach involves decomposing both the LDR and HDR images into two components: structural information and tonal information. To preserve the original image's structure we modify the reverse sampling process of a diffusion model and explicitly incorporate the structure information into the intermediate results.

They can infer the camera settings implicitly or explicitly to mitigate the depth uncertainty impact showcasing significant potential in real applications. However due to the limited camera setting diversity in the available datasets the inferred camera parameters are always simply hardcoded into the model during training and not adaptable to the input in inference making the learned models cannot generalize well under unseen camera settings. A natural solution is to artificially synthesize some samples i.e. 2D-3D pose pairs under massive new camera settings. Unfortunately to prevent over-fitting the existing camera setting the number of synthesized samples for each new camera setting should be comparable with that for the existing one which multiplies the scale of training and even makes it computationally prohibitive. In this paper we propose a novel HPE approach under the invariant risk minimization (IRM) paradigm. Precisely we first synthesize 2D poses from myriad camera settings. We then train our model under the IRM paradigm which targets at learning a common optimal model across all camera settings and thus enforces the model to automatically learn the camera parameters based on the input data. This allows the model to accurately infer 3D poses on unseen data by training on only a handful of samples from each synthesized setting and thus avoid the unbearable training cost increment. Another appealing feature of our method is that benefited from the capability of IRM in identifying the invariant features its performance on the seen camera settings is enhanced as well. Comprehensive experiments verify the superiority of our approach."},

To address this we collect the first dataset consisting of human natural language feedback on low-level vision.

However map elements contain strong shape priors. Subtle and sparse annotations make current detection-based frameworks ambiguous in locating relevant feature scopes and cause the loss of detailed structures in prediction. To alleviate these problems we propose MGMap a mask-guided approach that effectively highlights the informative regions and achieves precise map element localization by introducing the learned masks. Specifically MGMap employs learned masks based on the enhanced multi-scale BEV features from two perspectives. At the instance level we propose the Mask-activated instance (MAI) decoder which incorporates global instance and structural information into instance queries by the activation of instance masks. At the point level a novel position-guided mask patch refinement (PG-MPR) module is designed to refine point locations from a finer-grained perspective enabling the extraction of point-specific patch information. Compared to the baselines our proposed MGMap achieves a notable improvement of around 10 mAP for different input modalities.

Furthermore modality-specific encoders achieve impressive performances in their respective domains. This raises a central question: does an alignment exist between uni-modal vision and language encoders since they fundamentally represent the same physical world? Analyzing the latent spaces structure of vision and language models on image-caption benchmarks using the Centered Kernel Alignment (CKA) we find that the representation spaces of unaligned and aligned encoders are semantically similar. In the absence of statistical similarity in aligned encoders like CLIP we show that a possible matching of unaligned encoders exists without any training. We frame this as a seeded graph-matching problem exploiting the semantic similarity between graphs and propose two methods - a Fast Quadratic Assignment Problem optimization and a novel localized CKA metric-based matching/retrieval. We demonstrate the effectiveness of this on several downstream tasks including cross-lingual cross-domain caption matching and image classification.

In this work for the first time we synergize information from image text and event-data domains and introduce OpenESS to enable scalable ESS in an open-world annotation-efficient manner.

While some studies explore the rich generative prior of pre-trained diffusion models they typically rely on the assumed degradation process and cannot handle unknown real-world degradations well. To address these problems we propose a novel zero-shot framework FourierDiff which embeds Fourier priors into a pre-trained diffusion model to harmoniously handle the joint degradation of luminance and structures. FourierDiff is appealing in its relaxed requirements on paired training data and degradation assumptions. The key zero-shot insight is motivated by image characteristics in the Fourier domain: most luminance information concentrates on amplitudes while structure and content information are closely related to phases. Based on this observation we decompose the sampled results of the reverse diffusion process in the Fourier domain and take advantage of the amplitude of the generative prior to align the enhanced brightness with the distribution of natural images. To yield a sharp and content-consistent enhanced result we further design a spatial-frequency alternating optimization strategy to progressively refine the phase of the input.

To address these issues we propose a neural MRF model where both potential functions and message passing are designed using data-driven neural networks. Our fully data-driven model is built on the foundation of variational inference theory to prevent convergence issues and retain stereo MRF's graph inductive bias.

To address this problem we propose first to back-project features from large pre-trained 2D vision models onto 3D shapes and employ them for this task. We show that we obtain robust 3D features that contain rich semantic information and analyze multiple candidate features stemming from different 2D foundation models.

It is note that the VRP encoder can support a variety of annotation formats for reference images including point box scribble and mask. VRP-SAM achieves a breakthrough within the SAM framework by extending its versatility and applicability while preserving SAM's inherent strengths thus enhancing user-friendliness. To enhance the generalization ability of VRP-SAM the VRP encoder adopts a meta-learning strategy. To validate the effectiveness of VRP-SAM we conducted extensive empirical studies on the Pascal and COCO datasets. Remarkably VRP-SAM achieved state-of-the-art performance in visual reference segmentation with minimal learnable parameters. Furthermore VRP-SAM demonstrates strong generalization capabilities allowing it to perform segmentation of unseen objects and enabling cross-domain segmentation.

Frame-based deblurring methods lack reliable motion cues to restore sharp images under extreme blur conditions. The spike camera is a novel neuromorphic visual sensor that outputs spike streams with ultra-high temporal resolution. It can supplement the temporal information lost in traditional cameras and guide motion deblurring. However in real-world scenarios aligning discrete RGB images and continuous spike streams along both temporal and spatial axes is challenging due to the complexity of calibrating their coordinates device displacements in vibrations and time deviations. Misalignment of pixels leads to severe degradation of deblurring. We introduce the first framework for spike-guided motion deblurring without knowing the spatiotemporal alignment between spikes and images. To address the problem we first propose a novel three-stage network containing a basic deblurring net a carefully designed bi-directional deformable aligning module and a flow-based multi-scale fusion net. Experimental results demonstrate that our approach can effectively guide the image deblurring with unknown alignment surpassing the performance of other methods.

While domain generalization (DG) methods have been developed to enhance FAS performance they predominantly focus on learning domain-invariant features during training which may not guarantee generalizability to unseen data that differs largely from the source distributions. Our insight is that testing data can serve as a valuable resource to enhance the generalizability beyond mere evaluation for DG FAS. In this paper we introduce a novel Test-Time Domain Generalization (TTDG) framework for FAS which leverages the testing data to boost the model's generalizability. Our method consisting of Test-Time Style Projection (TTSP) and Diverse Style Shifts Simulation (DSSS) effectively projects the unseen data to the seen domain space. In particular we first introduce the innovative TTSP to project the styles of the arbitrarily unseen samples of the testing distribution to the known source space of the training distributions. We then design the efficient DSSS to synthesize diverse style shifts via learnable style bases with two specifically designed losses in a hyperspherical feature space. Our method eliminates the need for model updates at the test time and can be seamlessly integrated into not only the CNN but also ViT backbones. Comprehensive experiments on widely used cross-domain FAS benchmarks demonstrate our method's state-of-the-art performance and effectiveness."},

The missing of task labels in training leads to low-quality and noisy predictions as can be observed from state-of-the-art methods. To tackle this issue we reformulate the partially-labeled multi-task dense prediction as a pixel-level denoising problem and propose a novel multi-task denoising diffusion framework coined as DiffusionMTL. It designs a joint diffusion and denoising paradigm to model a potential noisy distribution in the task prediction or feature maps and generate rectified outputs for different tasks. To exploit multi-task consistency in denoising we further introduce a Multi-Task Conditioning strategy which can implicitly utilize the complementary nature of the tasks to help learn the unlabeled tasks leading to an improvement in the denoising performance of the different tasks. Extensive quantitative and qualitative experiments demonstrate that the proposed multi-task denoising diffusion model can significantly improve multi-task prediction maps and outperform the state-of-the-art methods on three challenging multi-task benchmarks under two different partial-labeling evaluation settings.

Yet the existing methods often fail or produce implausible motions with unseen text inputs which limits the applications. In this paper we present OMG a novel framework which enables compelling motion generation from zero-shot open-vocabulary text prompts. Our key idea is to carefully tailor the pretrain-then-finetune paradigm into the text-to-motion generation. At the pre-training stage our model improves the generation ability by learning the rich out-of-domain inherent motion traits. To this end we scale up a large unconditional diffusion model up to 1B parameters so as to utilize the massive unlabeled motion data up to over 20M motion instances. At the subsequent fine-tuning stage we introduce motion ControlNet which incorporates text prompts as conditioning information through a trainable copy of the pre-trained model and the proposed novel Mixture-of-Controllers (MoC) block. MoC block adaptively recognizes various ranges of the sub-motions with a cross-attention mechanism and processes them separately with the text-token-specific experts. Such a design effectively aligns the CLIP token embeddings of text prompts to various ranges of compact and expressive motion features.

Recent advancements in CoOp-based methods propose a set of learnable domain-shared or image-conditional textual tokens to facilitate the generation of task-specific textual classifiers.

To tackle this issue we present a novel Textual-based Class-aware Prompt tuning(TCP) that explicitly incorporates prior knowledge about classes to enhance their discriminability. The critical concept of TCP involves leveraging Textual Knowledge Embedding (TKE) to map the high generalizability of class-level textual knowledge into class aware textual tokens. By seamlessly integrating these class-aware prompts into the Text Encoder a dynamic class-aware classifier is generated to enhance discriminability for unseen domains. During inference TKE dynamically generates class-aware prompts related to the unseen classes. Comprehensive evaluations demonstrate that TKE serves as a plug-and-play module effortlessly combinable with existing methods.

However there are growing concerns that DMs could be used to imitate unauthorized creations and thus raise copyright issues. To address this issue we propose a novel framework that embeds personal watermarks in the generation of adversarial examples. Such examples can force DMs to generate images with visible watermarks and prevent DMs from imitating unauthorized images. We construct a generator based on conditional adversarial networks and design three losses (adversarial loss GAN loss and perturbation loss) to generate adversarial examples that have subtle perturbation but can effectively attack DMs to prevent copyright violations. Training a generator for a personal watermark by our method only requires 5-10 samples within 2-3 minutes and once the generator is trained it can generate adversarial examples with that watermark significantly fast (0.2s per image). We conduct extensive experiments in various conditional image-generation scenarios. Compared to existing methods that generate images with chaotic textures our method adds visible watermarks on the generated images which is a more straightforward way to indicate copyright violations. We also observe that our adversarial examples exhibit good transferability across unknown generative models. Therefore this work provides a simple yet powerful way to protect copyright from DM-based imitation."},

While existing methods simply align the person appearance to the target pose they are prone to overfitting due to the lack of a high-level semantic understanding on the source person image. In this paper we propose a novel Coarse-to-Fine Latent Diffusion (CFLD) method for PGPIS. In the absence of image-caption pairs and textual prompts we develop a novel training paradigm purely based on images to control the generation process of a pre-trained text-to-image diffusion model. A perception-refined decoder is designed to progressively refine a set of learnable queries and extract semantic understanding of person images as a coarse-grained prompt. This allows for the decoupling of fine-grained appearance and pose information controls at different stages and thus circumventing the potential overfitting problem. To generate more realistic texture details a hybrid-granularity attention module is proposed to encode multi-scale fine-grained appearance features as bias terms to augment the coarse-grained prompt.

We explore deformation-aware face stylization that diverges from traditional single-image style reference opting for a real-style image pair instead. The cornerstone of our method is the utilization of a self-supervised vision transformer specifically DINO-ViT to establish a robust and consistent facial structure representation across both real and style domains. Our stylization process begins by adapting the StyleGAN generator to be deformation-aware through the integration of spatial transformers (STN). We then introduce two innovative constraints for generator fine-tuning under the guidance of DINO semantics: i) a directional deformation loss that regulates directional vectors in DINO space and ii) a relative structural consistency constraint based on DINO token self-similarities ensuring diverse generation. Additionally style-mixing is employed to align the color generation with the reference minimizing inconsistent correspondences. This framework delivers enhanced deformability for general one-shot face stylization achieving notable efficiency with a fine-tuning duration of approximately 10 minutes.

It is expected that the prediction can maintain the corresponding rotation when objects rotate but severe mutation in angular prediction is sometimes observed when objects rotate near the boundary angle which is well-known boundary discontinuity problem. The problem has been long believed to be caused by the sharp loss increase at the angular boundary and widely used joint-optim IoU-like methods deal with this problem by loss-smoothing. However we experimentally find that even state-of-the-art IoU-like methods actually fail to solve the problem. On further analysis we find that the key to solution lies in encoding mode of the smoothing function rather than in joint or independent optimization. In existing IoU-like methods the model essentially attempts to fit the angular relationship between box and object where the break point at angular boundary makes the predictions highly unstable. To deal with this issue we propose a dual-optimization paradigm for angles. We decouple reversibility and joint-optim from single smoothing function into two distinct entities which for the first time achieves the objectives of both correcting angular boundary and blending angle with other parameters. Extensive experiments on multiple datasets show that boundary discontinuity problem is well-addressed. Moreover typical IoU-like methods are improved to the same level without obvious performance gap. The code is available at https://github.com/hangxu-cv/cvpr24acm."},

With the goal of minimizing human supervision in the editing process this paper presents a novel method for interactive batch image editing using StyleGAN as the medium. Given an edit specified by users in an example image (e.g. make the face frontal) our method can automatically transfer that edit to other test images so that regardless of their initial state (pose) they all arrive at the same final state (e.g. all facing front).

Combined with a ControlNet-Inpaint model our experiments demonstrate that SmartMask achieves superior object insertion quality preserving the background content more effectively than previous methods. Notably unlike prior works the proposed approach can also be used even without user-mask guidance which allows it to perform mask-free object insertion at diverse positions and scales. Furthermore we find that when used iteratively with a novel instruction-tuning based planning model SmartMask can be used to design detailed layouts from scratch. As compared with user-scribble based layout design we observe that SmartMask allows for better quality outputs with layout-to-image generation methods."},

Metaxas, Praveen Krishnan", "abstract": "While diffusion models have significantly advanced the quality of image generation their capability to accurately and coherently render text within these images remains a substantial challenge. Conventional diffusion-based methods for scene text generation are typically limited by their reliance on an intermediate layout output. This dependency often results in a constrained diversity of text styles and fonts an inherent limitation stemming from the deterministic nature of the layout generation phase. To address these challenges this paper introduces SceneTextGen a novel diffusion-based model specifically designed to circumvent the need for a predefined layout stage. By doing so SceneTextGen facilitates a more natural and varied representation of text. The novelty of SceneTextGen lies in its integration of three key components: a character-level encoder for capturing detailed typographic properties coupled with a character-level instance segmentation model and a word-level spotting model to address the issues of unwanted text generation and minor character inaccuracies. We validate the performance of our method by demonstrating improved character recognition rates on generated images across different public visual text datasets in comparison to both standard diffusion based methods and text specific methods."},

The core idea is a dynamic 3D representation based on 3D Gaussian splats that are rigged to a parametric morphable face model. This combination facilitates photorealistic rendering while allowing for precise animation control via the underlying parametric model e.g. through expression transfer from a driving sequence or by manually changing the morphable model parameters. We parameterize each splat by a local coordinate frame of a triangle and optimize for explicit displacement offset to obtain a more accurate geometric representation. During avatar reconstruction we jointly optimize for the morphable model parameters and Gaussian splat parameters in an end-to-end fashion. We demonstrate the animation capabilities of our photorealistic avatar in several challenging scenarios. For instance we show reenactments from a driving video where our method outperforms existing works by a significant margin."},

Despite significant progress in recent years specialist segmentation approaches are limited to specific tasks and data distribution. Retraining a new model for adaptation to new scenarios or settings takes expensive computation and time cost which raises the demand for versatile and universal segmentation model that can cater to various granularity. Although some attempts have been made for unifying different segmentation tasks or generalization to various scenarios limitations in the definition of paradigms and input-output spaces make it difficult for them to achieve accurate understanding of content at arbitrary granularity. To this end we present UniLSeg a universal segmentation model that can perform segmentation at any semantic level with the guidance of language instructions. For training UniLSeg we reorganize a group of tasks from original diverse distributions into a unified data format where images with texts describing segmentation targets as input and corresponding masks are output. Combined with a automatic annotation engine for utilizing numerous unlabeled data UniLSeg achieves excellent performance on various tasks and settings surpassing both specialist and unified segmentation models."},
{"title": "Diffusion Reflectance Map: Single-Image Stochastic Inverse Rendering of Illumination and Reflectance", "authors": "Yuto Enyo, Ko Nishino", "abstract": "Reflectance bounds the frequency spectrum of illumination in the object appearance. In this paper we introduce the first stochastic inverse rendering method which recovers the attenuated frequency spectrum of an illumination jointly with the reflectance of an object of known geometry from a single image. Our key idea is to solve this blind inverse problem in the reflectance map an appearance representation invariant to the underlying geometry by learning to reverse the image formation with a novel diffusion model which we refer to as the Diffusion Reflectance Map Network (DRMNet). Given an observed reflectance map converted and completed from the single input image DRMNet generates a reflectance map corresponding to a perfect mirror sphere while jointly estimating the reflectance. The forward process can be understood as gradually filtering a natural illumination with lower and lower frequency reflectance and additive Gaussian noise. DRMNet learns to invert this process with two subnetworks IllNet and RefNet which work in concert towards this joint estimation. The network is trained on an extensive synthetic dataset and is demonstrated to generalize to real images showing state-of-the-art accuracy on established datasets."},

However most real-world videos last for minutes or hours and have a complex hierarchical structure spanning different temporal granularities. We propose Video ReCap a recursive video captioning model that can process video inputs of dramatically different lengths (from 1 second to 2 hours) and output video captions at multiple hierarchy levels. The recursive video-language architecture exploits the synergy between different video hierarchies and can process hour-long videos efficiently. We utilize a curriculum learning training scheme to learn the hierarchical structure of videos starting from clip-level captions describing atomic actions then focusing on segment-level descriptions and concluding with generating summaries for hour-long videos. Furthermore we introduce Ego4D-HCap dataset by augmenting Ego4D with 8267 manually collected long-range video summaries.

This surge presents a significant challenge in efficiently choosing the most suitable pre-trained models for downstream tasks. The critical aspect of this challenge lies in effectively predicting the model transferability by considering the underlying fine-tuning dynamics. Existing methods often model fine-tuning dynamics in feature space with linear transformations which do not precisely align with the fine-tuning objective and fail to grasp the essential nonlinearity from optimization. To this end we present LEAD a finetuning-aligned approach based on the network output of logits. LEAD proposes a theoretical framework to model the optimization process and derives an ordinary differential equation (ODE) to depict the nonlinear evolution toward the final logit state. Additionally we design a class-aware decomposition method to consider the varying evolution dynamics across classes and further ensure practical applicability. Integrating the closely aligned optimization objective and nonlinear modeling capabilities derived from the differential equation our method offers a concise solution to effectively bridge the optimization gap in a single step bypassing the lengthy fine-tuning process. The comprehensive experiments on 24 supervised and self-supervised pre-trained models across 10 downstream datasets demonstrate impressive performances and showcase its broad adaptability even in low-data scenarios."},
{"title": "Towards Realistic Scene Generation with LiDAR Diffusion Models", "authors": "Haoxi Ran, Vitor Guizilini, Yue Wang", "abstract": "Diffusion models (DMs) excel in photo-realistic image synthesis but their adaptation to LiDAR scene generation poses a substantial hurdle. This is primarily because DMs operating in the point space struggle to preserve the curve-like patterns and 3D geometry of LiDAR scenes which consumes much of their representation power. In this paper we propose LiDAR Diffusion Models (LiDMs) to generate LiDAR-realistic scenes from a latent space tailored to capture the realism of LiDAR scenes by incorporating geometric priors into the learning pipeline. Our method targets three major desiderata: pattern realism geometry realism and object realism. Specifically we introduce curve-wise compression to simulate real-world LiDAR patterns point-wise coordinate supervision to learn scene geometry and patch-wise encoding for a full 3D object context. With these three core designs our method achieves competitive performance on unconditional LiDAR generation in 64-beam scenario and state of the art on conditional LiDAR generation while maintaining high efficiency compared to point-based DMs (up to 107xfaster). Furthermore by compressing LiDAR scenes into a latent space we enable the controllability of DMs with various conditions such as semantic maps camera views and text prompts.

With advancements in sensor manufacture and multi-modal learning techniques many multi-modal FAS approaches have emerged. However they face challenges in generalizing to unseen attacks and deployment conditions. These challenges arise from (1) modality unreliability where some modality sensors like depth and infrared undergo significant domain shifts in varying environments leading to the spread of unreliable information during cross-modal feature fusion and (2) modality imbalance where training overly relies on a dominant modality hinders the convergence of others reducing effectiveness against attack types that are indistinguishable by sorely using the dominant modality. To address modality unreliability we propose the Uncertainty-Guided Cross-Adapter (U-Adapter) to recognize unreliably detected regions within each modality and suppress the impact of unreliable regions on other modalities. For modality imbalance we propose a Rebalanced Modality Gradient Modulation (ReGrad) strategy to rebalance the convergence speed of all modalities by adaptively adjusting their gradients. Besides we provide the first large-scale benchmark for evaluating multi-modal FAS performance under domain generalization scenarios.

This immersive perspective brings dramatic visual changes and unique challenges compared to third-person views. Synthetic data has empowered third-person-view vision models but its application to embodied egocentric perception tasks remains largely unexplored. A critical challenge lies in simulating natural human movements and behaviors that effectively steer the embodied cameras to capture a faithful egocentric representation of the 3D world. To address this challenge we introduce EgoGen a new synthetic data generator that can produce accurate and rich ground-truth training data for egocentric perception tasks. At the heart of EgoGen is a novel human motion synthesis model that directly leverages egocentric visual inputs of a virtual human to sense the 3D environment. Combined with collision-avoiding motion primitives and a two-stage reinforcement learning approach our motion synthesis model offers a closed-loop solution where the embodied perception and movement of the virtual human are seamlessly coupled. Compared to previous works our model eliminates the need for a pre-defined global path and is directly applicable to dynamic environments. Combined with our easy-to-use and scalable data generation pipeline we demonstrate EgoGen's efficacy in three tasks: mapping and localization for head-mounted cameras egocentric camera tracking and human mesh recovery from egocentric views. EgoGen will be fully open-sourced offering a practical solution for creating realistic egocentric training data and aiming to serve as a useful tool for egocentric computer vision research."},

Existing works utilizing mean shapes often fall short of capturing this variation. To address this issue we present SecondPose a novel approach integrating object-specific geometric features with semantic category priors from DINOv2. Leveraging the advantage of DINOv2 in providing SE(3)-consistent semantic features we hierarchically extract two types of SE(3)-invariant geometric features to further encapsulate local-to-global object-specific information. These geometric features are then point-aligned with DINOv2 features to establish a consistent object representation under SE(3) transformations facilitating the mapping from camera space to the pre-defined canonical space thus further enhancing pose estimation. Extensive experiments on NOCS-REAL275 demonstrate that SecondPose achieves a 12.4% leap forward over the state-of-the-art.

Although numerous adaptation methods have been proposed they are designed to be efficient only in terms of how many parameters are trained. They however typically still require backpropagating gradients throughout the model meaning that their training-time and -memory cost does not reduce as significantly. We propose an adaptation method which does not backpropagate gradients through the backbone. We achieve this by designing a lightweight network in parallel that operates on features from the frozen pretrained backbone. As a result our method is efficient not only in terms of parameters but also in training-time and memory usage. Our approach achieves state-of-the-art accuracy-parameter trade-offs on the popular VTAB benchmark and we further show how we outperform prior works with respect to training-time and -memory usage too. We further demonstrate the training efficiency and scalability of our method by adapting a vision transformer backbone of 4 billion parameters for the computationally demanding task of video classification without any intricate model parallelism. Here we outperform a prior adaptor-based method which could only scale to a 1 billion parameter backbone or fully-finetuning a smaller backbone with the same GPU and less training time."},

Our primary focus is a novel approach to autocalibration a long-standing problem in computer vision. Traditional approaches to this problem such as those based on Kruppa's equations or the modulus constraint rely explicitly on the knowledge of multiple fundamental matrices or a projective reconstruction. In contrast we consider a novel formulation involving constraints on image points the unknown depths of 3D points and a partially specified calibration matrix K. For 2 and 3 views we present a comprehensive taxonomy of minimal autocalibration problems obtained by relaxing some of these constraints. These problems are organized into classes according to the number of views and any assumed prior knowledge of K. Within each class we determine problems with the fewest---or a relatively small number of---solutions. From this zoo of problems we devise three practical solvers.

Effective filtering of neural fields is critical to enable level-of-detail processing in downstream applications and support operations that involve sampling the field on regular grids (e.g. marching cubes). Existing methods that attempt to decompose neural fields in the frequency domain either resort to heuristics or require extensive modifications to the neural field architecture. We show that via a simple modification one can obtain neural fields that are low-pass filtered and in turn show how this can be exploited to obtain a frequency decomposition of the entire signal. We demonstrate the validity of our technique by investigating level-of-detail reconstruction and showing how coarser representations can be computed effectively."},

Second in the real-world finetuning stage MOHO leverages the amodal-mask-weighted geometric supervision to mitigate the unfaithful guidance caused by the hand-occluded supervising views in real world. Moreover domain-consistent occlusion-aware features are amalgamated in MOHO to resist object's self-occlusion for inferring the complete object shape.

This is particularly the case of oracle bone scripts where visual glyphs seem intuitive to people from distant past prove difficult to be understood in contemporary eyes. While semantic correspondence of an oracle can be found via a dictionary lookup this proves to be not enough for public viewers to connect the dots i.e. why does this oracle mean that? Common solution relies on a laborious curation process to collect visual guide for each oracle (Fig.1) which hinges on the case-by-case effort and taste of curators. This paper delves into one natural follow-up question: can AI take over?Begin with a comprehensive human study we show participants could indeed make better sense of an oracle glyph subjected to a proper visual guide and its efficacy can be approximated via a novel metric termed TransOV (Transferable Oracle Visuals). We then define a new conditional visual generation task based on an oracle glyph and its semantic meaning and importantly approach it by circumventing any form of model training in the presence of fatal lack of oracle data. At its heart is to leverage foundation model like GPT-4V to reason about the visual cues hidden inside an oracle and take advantage of an existing text-to-image model for final visual guide generation. Extensive empirical evidence shows our AI-enabled visual guides achieve significantly comparable TransOV performance compared with those collected under manual efforts.

Along this line many of the latest works follow an open-loop evaluation setting on nuScenes to study the planning behavior. In this paper we delve deeper into the problem by conducting thorough analyses and demystifying more devils in the details. We initially observed that the nuScenes dataset characterized by relatively simple driving scenarios leads to an under-utilization of perception information in end-to-end models incorporating ego status such as the ego vehicle's velocity. These models tend to rely predominantly on the ego vehicle's status for future path planning. Beyond the limitations of the dataset we also note that current metrics do not comprehensively assess the planning quality leading to potentially biased conclusions drawn from existing benchmarks. To address this issue we introduce a new metric to evaluate whether the predicted trajectories adhere to the road. We further propose a simple baseline able to achieve competitive results without relying on perception annotations.

To address the above limitations we propose Compact Occupancy TRansformer (COTR) with a geometry-aware occupancy encoder and a semantic-aware group decoder to reconstruct a compact 3D OCC representation. The occupancy encoder first generates a compact geometrical OCC feature through efficient explicit-implicit view transformation. Then the occupancy decoder further enhances the semantic discriminability of the compact OCC representation by a coarse-to-fine semantic grouping strategy. Empirical experiments show that there are evident performance gains across multiple baselines e.g. COTR outperforms baselines with a relative improvement of 8%-15% demonstrating the superiority of our method."},

StreamingFlow is a novel BEV occupancy predictor that ingests asynchronous multi-sensor data streams for fusion and performs streaming forecasting of the future occupancy map at any future timestamps. By integrating neural ordinary differential equations (N-ODE) into recurrent neural networks StreamingFlow learns derivatives of BEV features over temporal horizons updates the implicit sensor's BEV features as part of the fusion process and propagates BEV states to the desired future time point. It shows good zero-shot generalization ability of prediction reflected in the interpolation of the observed prediction time horizon and the reasonable inference of the unseen farther future period.

While existing methods have made significant progress they often focus on predicting major body joints overlooking fine-grained gestures and their interaction with objects. Human hand movements particularly during object interactions play a pivotal role and provide more precise expressions of human poses. This work fills this gap and introduces a novel paradigm: forecasting 3D whole-body human poses with a focus on grasping objects. This task involves predicting activities across all joints in the body and hands encompassing the complexities of internal heterogeneity and external interactivity. To tackle these challenges we also propose a novel approach: C^3HOST cross-context cross-modal consolidation for 3D whole-body pose forecasting effectively handles the complexities of internal heterogeneity and external interactivity. C^3HOST involves distinct steps including the heterogeneous content encoding and alignment and cross-modal feature learning and interaction. These enable us to predict activities across all body and hand joints ensuring high-precision whole-body human pose prediction even during object grasping.

While this is a significant development most sampling methods still employ uniform time steps which is not optimal when using a small number of steps. To address this issue we propose a general framework for designing an optimization problem that seeks more appropriate time steps for a specific numerical ODE solver for DPMs. This optimization problem aims to minimize the distance between the ground-truth solution to the ODE and an approximate solution corresponding to the numerical solver. It can be efficiently solved using the constrained trust region method taking less than 15 seconds. Our extensive experiments on both unconditional and conditional sampling using pixel- and latent-space DPMs demonstrate that when combined with the state-of-the-art sampling method UniPC our optimized time steps significantly improve image generation performance in terms of FID scores for datasets such as CIFAR-10 and ImageNet compared to using uniform time steps."},

Our resulting model can \"see\" by detecting whether objects are present in an image \"say\" by telling the user if they are not proposing alternative queries or correcting semantic errors in the query and finally \"segment\" by outputting the mask of the desired objects if they exist. Additionally we introduce a novel False Premise Correction benchmark dataset an extension of existing RefCOCO(+/g) referring segmentation datasets (which we call FP-RefCOCO(+/g)). The results show that our method not only detects false premises up to 55% better than existing approaches but under false premise conditions produces relative cIOU improvements of more than 31% over baselines and produces natural language feedback judged helpful up to 67% of the time."},

While weakly supervised point cloud semantic segmentation (WSPCSS) with sparse annotation shows promise the limited information from initial sparse labels can place an upper bound on performance. As a new research direction for WSPCSS we propose a novel Region Exploration via Artificial Labeling (REAL) framework. It leverages a foundational image model as an artificial oracle within the active learning context eliminating the need for manual annotation by a human oracle. To integrate the 2D model into the 3D domain we first introduce a Projection-based Point-toSegment (PP2S) module designed to enable prompt segmentation of 3D data without additional training. The REAL framework samples query points based on model predictions and requests annotations from PP2S dynamically refining labels and improving model training. Furthermore to overcome several challenges of employing an artificial model as an oracle we formulate effective query sampling and label updating strategies. Our comprehensive experiments and comparisons demonstrate that the REAL framework significantly outperforms existing methods across various benchmarks.

Autofocus control (AC) plays a pivotal role in a camera to efficiently capture information in challenging real-world scenarios. Nevertheless due to disparities in data modality and information characteristics compared to frame stream and event stream the current lack of efficient AC methods has made it challenging for spike cameras to adapt to intricate real-world conditions. To address this challenge we introduce a spike-based autofocus framework that includes a spike-specific focus measure called spike dispersion (SD) which effectively mitigates the influence of variations in scene light intensity during the focusing process by leveraging the spike camera's ability to record full-time spatial light intensity. Additionally the framework integrates a fast search strategy called spike-based golden fast search (SGFS) allowing rapid focal positioning without the need for a complete focus range traversal. To validate the performance of our method we have collected a spike-based autofocus dataset (SAD) containing synthetic data and real-world data under varying scene brightness and motion scenarios. Experimental results on these datasets demonstrate that our method offers state-of-the-art accuracy and efficiency. Furthermore experiments with data captured under varying scene brightness levels illustrate the robustness of our method to changes in light intensity during the focusing process."},

However the explicit and discrete representation encounters challenges when applied to scenes featuring reflective surfaces. In this paper we present GaussianShader a novel method that applies a simplified shading function on 3D Gaussians to enhance the neural rendering in scenes with reflective surfaces while preserving the training and rendering efficiency. The main challenge in applying the shading function lies in the accurate normal estimation on discrete 3D Gaussians. Specifically we proposed a novel normal estimation framework based on the shortest axis directions of 3D Gaussians with a delicately designed loss to make the consistency between the normals and the geometries of Gaussian spheres. Experiments show that GaussianShader strikes a commendable balance between efficiency and visual quality. Our method surpasses Gaussian Splatting in PSNR on specular object datasets exhibiting an improvement of 1.57dB. When compared to prior works handling reflective surfaces such as Ref-NeRF our optimization time is significantly accelerated (23h vs. 0.58h)."},

Using Harvard-FairVLMed we conduct a comprehensive fairness analysis of two widely-used VL models (CLIP and BLIP2) pre-trained on both natural and medical domains across four different protected attributes.

Despite the notable advancements it remains challenging in human-centric content synthesis such as realistic dance generation. Current methodologies primarily tailored for human motion transfer encounter difficulties when confronted with real-world dance scenarios (e.g. social media dance) which require to generalize across a wide spectrum of poses and intricate human details. In this paper we depart from the traditional paradigm of human motion transfer and emphasize two additional critical attributes for the synthesis of human dance content in social media contexts: (i) Generalizability: the model should be able to generalize beyond generic human viewpoints as well as unseen human subjects backgrounds and poses; (ii) Compositionality: it should allow for the seamless composition of seen/unseen subjects backgrounds and poses from different sources. To address these challenges we introduce DISCO which includes a novel model architecture with disentangled control to improve the compositionality of dance synthesis and an effective human attribute pre-training for better generalizability to unseen humans.

However when learning with noisy labels (LNL) they can easily overfit and fail to generalize to new data. This paper introduces a simple and effective method named Learning to Bootstrap (L2B) which enables models to bootstrap themselves using their own predictions without being adversely affected by erroneous pseudo-labels. It achieves this by dynamically adjusting the importance weight between real observed and generated labels as well as between different samples through meta-learning. Unlike existing instance reweighting methods the key to our method lies in a new versatile objective that enables implicit relabeling concurrently leading to significant improvements without incurring additional costs. L2B offers several benefits over the baseline methods. It yields more robust models that are less susceptible to the impact of noisy labels by guiding the bootstrapping procedure more effectively. It better exploits the valuable information contained in corrupted instances by adapting the weights of both instances and labels. Furthermore L2B is compatible with existing LNL methods and delivers competitive results spanning natural and medical imaging tasks including classification and segmentation under both synthetic and real-world noise. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our method effectively mitigates the challenges of noisy labels often necessitating few to no validation samples and is well generalized to other tasks such as image segmentation.

However recent research has unveiled a susceptibility of ViTs to adversarial attacks akin to their CNN counterparts. Adversarial training and randomization are two representative effective defenses for CNNs. Some researchers have attempted to apply adversarial training to ViTs and achieved comparable robustness to CNNs while it is not easy to directly apply randomization to ViTs because of the architecture difference between CNNs and ViTs. In this paper we delve into the structural intricacies of ViTs and propose a novel defense mechanism termed Random entangled image Transformer (ReiT) which seamlessly integrates adversarial training and randomization to bolster the adversarial robustness of ViTs. Recognizing the challenge posed by the structural disparities between ViTs and CNNs we introduce a novel module input-independent random entangled self-attention (II-ReSA). This module optimizes random entangled tokens that lead to \"dissimilar\" self-attention outputs by leveraging model parameters and the sampled random tokens thereby synthesizing the self-attention module outputs and random entangled tokens to diminish adversarial similarity. ReiT incorporates two distinct random entangled tokens and employs dual randomization offering an effective countermeasure against adversarial examples while ensuring comprehensive deduction guarantees.

However due to the limited size and quality of existing 3D datasets they still suffer from multi-view inconsistencies and Neural Radiance Field (NeRF) reconstruction artifacts. We argue that multi-view diffusion models can benefit from further Reinforcement Learning Finetuning (RLFT) which allows models to learn from the data generated by themselves and improve beyond their dataset limitations during SFT. To this end we introduce Carve3D an improved RLFT algorithm coupled with a novel Multi-view Reconstruction Consistency (MRC) metric to enhance the consistency of multi-view diffusion models. To measure the MRC metric on a set of multi-view images we compare them with their corresponding NeRF renderings at the same camera viewpoints. The resulting model which we denote as Carve3DM demonstrates superior multi-view consistency and NeRF reconstruction quality than existing models.

How to improve token representation and optimize token decoding presents significant challenges. This paper introduces PredToken a novel predictive framework that addresses these issues by decoupling space-time tokens into distinct components for iterative cascaded decoding. Concretely we first design a \"decomposition quantization and reconstruction\" schema based on VQGAN to improve the token representation. This scheme disentangles low- and high-frequency representations and employs a dimension-aware quantization model allowing more low-level details to be preserved. Building on this we present a \"coarse-to-fine iterative decoding\" method. It leverages dynamic soft decoding to refine coarse tokens and static soft decoding for fine tokens enabling more high-level dynamics to be captured. These designs make PredToken produce high-quality predictions. Extensive experiments demonstrate the superiority of our method on various real-world spatiotemporal predictive benchmarks. Furthermore PredToken can also be extended to other visual generative tasks to yield realistic outcomes."},

These algorithms are predominantly based on heatmaps resulting in high computation and storage requirements per frame which limits their flexibility and real-time application in video scenarios particularly on edge devices. In this paper we develop an efficient and effective video-based human pose regression method which bypasses intermediate representations such as heatmaps and instead directly maps the input to the output joint coordinates. Despite the inherent spatial correlation among adjacent joints of the human pose the temporal trajectory of each individual joint exhibits relative independence. In light of this we propose a novel Decoupled Space-Time Aggregation network (DSTA) to separately capture the spatial contexts between adjacent joints and the temporal cues of each individual joint thereby avoiding the conflation of spatiotemporal dimensions. Concretely DSTA learns a dedicated feature token for each joint to facilitate the modeling of their spatiotemporal dependencies. With the proposed joint-wise local-awareness attention mechanism our method is capable of efficiently and flexibly utilizing the spatial dependency of adjacent joints and the temporal dependency of each joint itself. Extensive experiments demonstrate the superiority of our method. Compared to previous regression-based single-frame human pose estimation methods DSTA significantly enhances performance achieving an 8.9 mAP improvement on PoseTrack2017.

However the oversized neural networks render them impractical for deployment on resource-constrained systems which unavoidably requires more computational time and resources during reference. To handle this knowledge distillation offers a promising approach that compresses models by enabling a smaller student model to learn from a larger teacher model. Nevertheless how to apply knowledge distillation to compress motion planners has not been explored so far. In this paper we propose PlanKD the first knowledge distillation framework tailored for compressing end-to-end motion planners. First considering that driving scenes are inherently complex often containing planning-irrelevant or even noisy information transferring such information is not beneficial for the student planner. Thus we design an information bottleneck based strategy to only distill planning-relevant information rather than transfer all information indiscriminately. Second different waypoints in an output planned trajectory may hold varying degrees of importance for motion planning where a slight deviation in certain crucial waypoints might lead to a collision. Therefore we devise a safety-aware waypoint-attentive distillation module that assigns adaptive weights to different waypoints based on the importance to encourage the student to accurately mimic more crucial waypoints thereby improving overall safety. Experiments demonstrate that our PlanKD can boost the performance of smaller planners by a large margin and significantly reduce their reference time."},

However training SparseFormers from scratch is still expensive and scaling up the number of parameters can be challenging. In this paper we propose to bootstrap SparseFormers from ViT-based vision foundation models in a simple and efficient way. Since the majority of SparseFormer blocks are the standard transformer ones we can inherit weights from large-scale pre-trained vision transformers and freeze them as much as possible. Therefore we only need to train the SparseFormer-specific lightweight focusing transformer to adjust token RoIs and fine-tune a few early pre-trained blocks to align the final token representation. In such a way we can bootstrap SparseFormer architectures from various large-scale pre-trained models (e.g. IN-21K pre-trained AugRegs or CLIPs) using a rather smaller amount of training samples (e.g. IN-1K) and without labels or captions within just a few hours. As a result the bootstrapped unimodal SparseFormer (from AugReg-ViT-L/16-384) can reach 84.9% accuracy on IN-1K with only 49 tokens and the multimodal SparseFormer from CLIPs also demonstrates notable zero-shot performance with highly reduced computational cost without seeing any caption during the bootstrapping procedure. In addition CLIP-bootstrapped SparseFormers which align the output space with language without seeing a word can serve as efficient vision encoders in multimodal large language models.

To make full use of temporal images we design a Temporal Image Aggregation and Fusion (TIAF) module which can greatly expand the camera FOV and enhance the present features. Temporal LiDAR points in the camera FOV are used as mediums to transform temporal image features to the present coordinate for temporal multi-modal fusion. Moreover we develop a Static-Moving Switch Augmentation (SMSA) algorithm which utilizes sufficient temporal information to enable objects to switch their motion states freely thus greatly increasing static and moving training samples. Our TASeg ranks 1st on three challenging tracks i.e. SemanticKITTI single-scan track multi-scan track and nuScenes LiDAR segmentation track strongly demonstrating the superiority of our method.

{"title": "Mirasol3B: A Multimodal Autoregressive Model for Time-Aligned and Contextual Modalities", "authors": "AJ Piergiovanni, Isaac Noble, Dahun Kim, Michael S. Ryoo, Victor Gomes, Anelia Angelova", "abstract": "One of the main challenges of multimodal learning is the need to combine heterogeneous modalities (e.g. video audio text). For example video and audio are obtained at much higher rates than text and are roughly aligned in time. They are often not synchronized with text which comes as a global context e.g. a title or a description. Furthermore video and audio inputs are of much larger volumes and grow as the video length increases which naturally requires more compute dedicated to these modalities and makes modeling of long-range dependencies harder. We here decouple the multimodal modeling dividing it into separate autoregressive models processing the inputs according to the characteristics of the modalities. We propose a multimodal model consisting of an autoregressive component for the time-synchronized modalities (audio and video) and an autoregressive component for the context modalities which are not necessarily aligned in time but are still sequential. To address the long-sequences of the video-audio inputs we further partition the video and audio sequences in consecutive snippets and autoregressively process their representations. To that end we propose a Combiner mechanism which models the audio-video information jointly producing compact but expressive representations. This allows us to scale to 512 input video frames without increase in model parameters. Our approach achieves the state-of-the-art on multiple well established multimodal benchmarks. It effectively addresses the high computational demand of media inputs by learning compact representations controlling the sequence length of the audio-video feature representations and modeling their dependencies in time."},
{"title": "StraightPCF: Straight Point Cloud Filtering", "authors": "Dasith de Silva Edirimuni, Xuequan Lu, Gang Li, Lei Wei, Antonio Robles-Kelly, Hongdong Li", "abstract": "Point cloud filtering is a fundamental 3D vision task which aims to remove noise while recovering the underlying clean surfaces. State-of-the-art methods remove noise by moving noisy points along stochastic trajectories to the clean surfaces. These methods often require regularization within the training objective and/or during post-processing to ensure fidelity. In this paper we introduce StraightPCF a new deep learning based method for point cloud filtering. It works by moving noisy points along straight paths thus reducing discretization errors while ensuring faster convergence to the clean surfaces. We model noisy patches as intermediate states between high noise patch variants and their clean counterparts and design the VelocityModule to infer a constant flow velocity from the former to the latter. This constant flow leads to straight filtering trajectories. In addition we introduce a DistanceModule that scales the straight trajectory using an estimated distance scalar to attain convergence near the clean surface. Our network is lightweight and only has  530K parameters being 17% of IterativePFN (a most recent point cloud filtering network). Extensive experiments on both synthetic and real-world data show our method achieves state-of-the-art results. Our method also demonstrates nice distributions of filtered points without the need for regularization. The implementation code can be found at: https://github.com/ddsediri/StraightPCF."},

Compared with geometry the diverse texture design plays an important role in making 3D biped cartoon characters vivid and charming. Therefore we focus on automatic texture design for cartoon characters based on input instructions. This is challenging for domain-specific requirements and a lack of high-quality data. To address this challenge we propose Make-It-Vivid the first attempt to enable high-quality texture generation from text in UV space. We prepare a detailed text-texture paired data for 3D characters by using vision-question-answering agents. Then we customize a pretrained text-to-image model to generate texture map with template structure while preserving the natural 2D image knowledge. Furthermore to enhance fine-grained details we propose a novel adversarial learning scheme to shorten the domain gap between original dataset and realistic texture domain. Extensive experiments show that our approach outperforms current texture generation methods resulting in efficient character texturing and faithful generation with prompts. Besides we showcase various applications such as out of domain generation and texture stylization. We also provide an efficient generation system for automatic text-guided textured character generation and animation."},

However current 3DSGG methods struggle with two main challenges. 1) The dependency on labor-intensive ground-truth annotations. 2) Closed-set classes training hampers the recognition of novel objects and predicates. Addressing these issues our idea is to extract cross-modality features by CLIP from text and image data naturally related to 3D point clouds. Cross-modality features are used to train a robust 3D scene graph (3DSG) feature extractor. Specifically we propose a novel Cross-Modality Contrastive Learning 3DSGG (CCL-3DSGG) method. Firstly to align the text with 3DSG the text is parsed into word level that are consistent with the 3DSG annotation. To enhance robustness during the alignment adjectives are exchanged for different objects as negative samples. Then to align the image with 3DSG the camera view is treated as a positive sample and other views as negatives. Lastly the recognition of novel object and predicate classes is achieved by calculating the cosine similarity between prompts and 3DSG features. Our rigorous experiments confirm the superior open-vocabulary capability and applicability of CCL-3DSGG in real-world contexts."},

Compared with existing research this task involves predicting less controlled unpremeditated and pure reactive motions in response to external impact and how such motions can propagate through people. It brings new challenges such as data scarcity and predicting complex interactions. To this end we propose a new method capitalizing differentiable physics and deep neural networks leading to an explicit Latent Differentiable Physics (LDP) model. Through experiments we demonstrate that LDP has high data efficiency outstanding prediction accuracy strong generalizability and good explainability. Since there is no similar research a comprehensive comparison with 11 adapted baselines from several relevant domains is conducted showing LDP outperforming existing research both quantitatively and qualitatively improving prediction accuracy by as much as 70% and demonstrating significantly stronger generalization."},

SAM presents strong generalizability to segment anything while is short for semantic understanding. By introducing a lightweight query-based feature mixer we align the region-specific features with the embedding space of language models for later caption generation. As the number of trainable parameters is small (typically in the order of tens of millions) it costs less computation less memory usage and less communication bandwidth resulting in both fast and scalable training. To address the scarcity problem of regional caption data we propose to first pre-train our model on objection detection and segmentation tasks. We call this step weak supervision pretraining since the pretraining data only contains category names instead of full-sentence descriptions. The weak supervision pretraining allows us to leverage many publicly available object detection and segmentation datasets. We conduct extensive experiments to demonstrate the superiority of our method and validate each design choice. This work serves as a stepping stone towards scaling up regional captioning data and sheds light on exploring efficient ways to augment SAM with regional semantics."},

Without explicit 3D priors these methods often lead to geometric anomalies and multi-view inconsistency. Recently researchers have attempted to improve the genuineness of 3D objects by directly training on 3D datasets albeit at the cost of low-quality texture generation due to the limited texture diversity in 3D datasets. To harness the advantages of both approaches we propose Bidirectional Diffusion (BiDiff) a unified framework that incorporates both a 3D and a 2D diffusion process to preserve both 3D fidelity and 2D texture richness respectively. Moreover as a simple combination may yield inconsistent generation results we further bridge them with novel bidirectional guidance. In addition our method can be used as an initialization of optimization-based models to further improve the quality of 3D model and efficiency of optimization reducing the process from 3.4 hours to 20 minutes. Experimental results have shown that our model achieves high-quality diverse and scalable 3D generation. Project website https://bidiff.github.io/."},

With the burgeoning domains of the digital human the need for quick and personalized hand avatar creation has become increasingly critical. Existing techniques typically require extensive input data and may prove cumbersome or even impractical in certain scenarios. To enhance accessibility we present a novel method OHTA (One-shot Hand avaTAr) that enables the creation of detailed hand avatars from merely one image. OHTA tackles the inherent difficulties of this data-limited problem by learning and utilizing data-driven hand priors. Specifically we design a hand prior model initially employed for 1) learning various hand priors with available data and subsequently for 2) the inversion and fitting of the target identity with prior knowledge. OHTA demonstrates the capability to create high-fidelity hand avatars with consistent animatable quality solely relying on a single image. Furthermore we illustrate the versatility of OHTA through diverse applications encompassing text-to-avatar conversion hand editing and identity latent space manipulation."},

Additionally we develop a new channel-agnostic MAE architecture (CA-MAE) that allows for inputting images of different numbers and orders of channels at inference time. We demonstrate that CA-MAEs effectively generalize by inferring and evaluating on a microscopy image dataset (JUMP-CP) generated under different experimental conditions with a different channel structure than our pretraining data (RPI-93M).

Few-shot adaptation methods based on prompt tuning have been shown to further improve performance on downstream datasets. However these methods do not fare well in the taxonomic open set (TOS) setting where the classifier is asked to make prediction from label set across different levels of semantic granularity. Frequently they infer incorrect labels at coarser taxonomic class levels even when the inference at the leaf level (original class labels) is correct. To address this problem we propose a prompt tuning technique that calibrates the hierarchical consistency of model predictions. A set of metrics of hierarchical consistency the Hierarchical Consistent Accuracy (HCA) and the Mean Treecut Accuracy (MTA) are first proposed to evaluate TOS model performance. A new Prompt Tuning for Hierarchical Consistency (ProTeCt) technique is then proposed to calibrate classification across label set granularities. Results show that ProTeCt can be combined with existing prompt tuning methods to significantly improve TOS classification without degrading the leaf level classification performance."},

Unlike recent 3D generative models that rely on clean and well-aligned 3D data limiting them to single or few-class generation our model is directly trained on extensive noisy and unaligned `in-the-wild' 3D assets mitigating the key challenge (i.e. data scarcity) in large-scale 3D generation. In particular DIRECT-3D is a tri-plane diffusion model that integrates two innovations: 1) A novel learning framework where noisy data are filtered and aligned automatically during the training process. Specifically after an initial warm-up phase using a small set of clean data an iterative optimization is introduced in the diffusion process to explicitly estimate the 3D pose of objects and select beneficial data based on conditional density. 2) An efficient 3D representation that is achieved by disentangling object geometry and color features with two separate conditional diffusion models that are optimized hierarchically. Given a prompt input our model generates high-quality high-resolution realistic and complex 3D objects with accurate geometric details in seconds. We achieve state-of-the-art performance in both single-class generation and text-to-3D generation.

In this work we address the lack of reasoning ability by data augmentation. We leverage Large Language Models (LLMs) which have shown to have strong reasoning ability as an automatic data annotator that generates question-answer annotations for chart images. The key innovation in our method lies in the Synthesize Step-by-Step strategy: our LLM-based data generator learns to decompose the complex question into step-by-step sub-questions (rationales) which are then used to derive the final answer using external tools i.e. Python. This step-wise generation procedure is trained on synthetic data generated using a template-based QA generation pipeline. Experimental results highlight the significance of the proposed step-by-step generation. By training with the LLM-augmented data (LAMENDA) we significantly enhance the chart VQA models achieving the state-of-the-art accuracy on the ChartQA and PlotQA datasets. In particular our approach improves the accuracy of the previous state-of-the-art approach from 38% to 54% on the human-written questions in the ChartQA dataset which needs strong reasoning.

We propose a novel adversarial backdoor attack against trajectory prediction models as a means of studying their potential vulnerabilities. Our attack affects the victim at training time via naturalistic hence stealthy poisoned samples crafted using a novel two-step approach. First the triggers are crafted by perturbing the trajectory of attacking vehicle and then disguised by transforming the scene using a bi-level optimization technique. The proposed attack does not depend on a particular model architecture and operates in a black-box manner thus can be effective without any knowledge of the victim model. We conduct extensive empirical studies using state-of-the-art prediction models on two benchmark datasets using metrics customized for trajectory prediction. We show that the proposed attack is highly effective as it can significantly hinder the performance of prediction models unnoticeable by the victims and efficient as it forces the victim to generate malicious behavior even under constrained conditions. Via ablative studies we analyze the impact of different attack design choices followed by an evaluation of existing defence mechanisms against the proposed attack."},

In practice the image-text pairs inevitably exist under-correlated or even false-correlated a.k.a noisy correspondence (NC) due to the low quality of the images and annotation errors. To address this problem we propose a novel Robust Dual Embedding method (RDE) that can learn robust visual-semantic associations even with NC. Specifically RDE consists of two main components: 1) A Confident Consensus Division (CCD) module that leverages the dual-grained decisions of dual embedding modules to obtain a consensus set of clean training data which enables the model to learn correct and reliable visual-semantic associations. 2) A Triplet Alignment Loss (TAL) relaxes the conventional Triplet Ranking loss with the hardest negative samples to a log-exponential upper bound over all negative ones thus preventing the model collapse under NC and can also focus on hard-negative samples for promising performance.

MeLFusion is a text-to-music diffusion model with a novel \"visual synapse\" which effectively infuses the semantics from the visual modality into the generated music. To facilitate research in this area we introduce a new dataset MeLBench and propose a new evaluation metric IMSM. Our exhaustive experimental evaluation suggests that adding visual information to the music synthesis pipeline significantly improves the quality of generated music measured both objectively and subjectively with a relative gain of up to 67.98% on the FAD score.

However the field of transferable targeted 3D adversarial attacks remains vacant. The goal of this work is to develop a more effective technique that could generate transferable targeted 3D adversarial examples filling the gap in this field. To achieve this goal we design a novel framework named TT3D that could rapidly reconstruct from few multi-view images into Transferable Targeted 3D textured meshes. While existing mesh-based texture optimization methods compute gradients in the high-dimensional mesh space and easily fall into local optima leading to unsatisfactory transferability and distinct distortions TT3D innovatively performs dual optimization towards both feature grid and Multi-layer Perceptron (MLP) parameters in the grid-based NeRF space which significantly enhances black-box transferability while enjoying naturalness.

Many methods leverage data-driven learning due to the intricacies of scene complexity and significant indoor occlusions. Training these methods often requires a large-scale high-quality dataset with aligned and paired shape annotations with real-world scans. Existing datasets are either synthetic or misaligned restricting the performance of data-driven methods on real data. To this end we introduce LASA a Large-scale Aligned Shape Annotation Dataset comprising 10412 high-quality CAD annotations aligned with 920 real-world scene scans from ArkitScenes created manually by professional artists. On this top we propose a novel Diffusion-based Cross-Modal Shape Reconstruction (DisCo) method. It is empowered by a hybrid feature aggregation design to fuse multi-modal inputs and recover high-fidelity object geometries. Besides we present an Occupancy-Guided 3D Object Detection (OccGOD) method and demonstrate that our shape annotations provide scene occupancy clues that can further improve 3D object detection. Supported by LASA extensive experiments show that our methods achieve state-of-the-art performance in both instance-level scene reconstruction and 3D object detection tasks."},

Kot, Shijian Lu", "abstract": "Cross-Domain Few-Shot Segmentation (CD-FSS) poses the challenge of segmenting novel categories from a distinct domain using only limited exemplars. In this paper we undertake a comprehensive study of CD-FSS and uncover two crucial insights: (i) the necessity of a fine-tuning stage to effectively transfer the learned meta-knowledge across domains and (ii) the overfitting risk during the naive fine-tuning due to the scarcity of novel category examples. With these insights we propose a novel cross-domain fine-tuning strategy that addresses the challenging CD-FSS tasks. We first design Bi-directional Few-shot Prediction (BFP) which establishes support-query correspondence in a bi-directional manner crafting augmented supervision to reduce the overfitting risk. Then we further extend BFP into Iterative Few-shot Adaptor (IFA) which is a recursive framework to capture the support-query correspondence iteratively targeting maximal exploitation of supervisory signals from the sparse novel category samples. Extensive empirical evaluations show that our method significantly outperforms the state-of-the-arts (+7.8%) which verifies that IFA tackles the cross-domain challenges and mitigates the overfitting simultaneously.

Despite considerable efforts invested in developing various capture systems and reconstruction algorithms recent advancements still struggle with loose or oversized clothing and overly complex poses. In part this is due to the challenges of acquiring high-quality human datasets. To facilitate the development of these fields in this paper we present PKU-DyMVHumans a versatile human-centric dataset for high-fidelity reconstruction and rendering of dynamic human scenarios from dense multi-view videos. It comprises 8.2 million frames captured by more than 56 synchronized cameras across diverse scenarios. These sequences comprise 32 human subjects across 45 different scenarios each with a high-detailed appearance and realistic human motion. Inspired by recent advancements in neural radiance field (NeRF)-based scene representations we carefully set up an off-the-shelf framework that is easy to provide those state-of-the-art NeRF-based implementations and benchmark on PKU-DyMVHumans dataset. It is paving the way for various applications like fine-grained foreground/background decomposition high-quality human reconstruction and photo-realistic novel view synthesis of a dynamic scene.

In this work we introduce Concept Weaver a method for composing customized text-to-image diffusion models at inference time. Specifically the method breaks the process into two steps: creating a template image aligned with the semantics of input prompts and then personalizing the template using a concept fusion strategy. The fusion strategy incorporates the appearance of the target concepts into the template image while retaining its structural details. The results indicate that our method can generate multiple custom concepts with higher identity fidelity compared to alternative approaches. Furthermore the method is shown to seamlessly handle more than two concepts and closely follow the semantic meaning of the input prompt without blending appearances across different subjects."},

Recent works on VOS employ bottom-up pixel-level memory reading which struggles due to matching noise especially in the presence of distractors resulting in lower performance in more challenging data. In contrast Cutie performs top-down object-level memory reading by adapting a small set of object queries. Via those it interacts with the bottom-up pixel features iteratively with a query-based object transformer (qt hence Cutie). The object queries act as a high-level summary of the target object while high-resolution feature maps are retained for accurate segmentation. Together with foreground-background masked attention Cutie cleanly separates the semantics of the foreground object from the background. On the challenging MOSE dataset Cutie improves by 8.7 J&F over XMem with a similar running time and improves by 4.2 J&F over DeAOT while being three times faster.

However the efficacy of a single method can degenerate when transferring to other tasks modalities or even other architectures. To address this limitation we propose a novel constrained feature distillation method. This method is derived from a small set of core principles which results in two emerging components: an orthogonal projection and a task-specific normalisation. Equipped with both of these components our transformer models can outperform all previous methods on ImageNet and reach up to a 4.4% relative improvement over the previous state-of-the-art methods. To further demonstrate the generality of our method we apply it to object detection and image generation whereby we obtain consistent and substantial performance improvements over state-of-the-art.

Large kernel CNNs have been reported to perform well in downstream vision tasks as well as in classification performance. The reason for the high-performance of large kernel CNNs in downstream tasks has been attributed to the large effective receptive field (ERF) produced by large size kernels but this view has not been fully tested. We therefore revisit the performance of large kernel CNNs in downstream task focusing on the weakly supervised object localization (WSOL) task. WSOL a difficult downstream task that is not fully supervised provides a new angle to explore the capabilities of the large kernel CNNs. Our study compares the modern large kernel CNNs ConvNeXt RepLKNet and SLaK to test the validity of the naive expectation that ERF size is important for improving downstream task performance. Our analysis of the factors contributing to high performance provides a different perspective in which the main factor is feature map improvement. Furthermore we find that modern CNNs are robust to the CAM problems of local regions of objects being activated which has long been discussed in WSOL. CAM is the most classic WSOL method but because of the above-mentioned problems it is often used as a baseline method for comparison. However experiments on the CUB-200-2011 dataset show that simply combining a large kernel CNN CAM and simple data augmentation methods can achieve performance (90.99% MaxBoxAcc) comparable to the latest WSOL method which is CNN-based and requires special training or complex post-processing."},

The more recent Embodied AI literature on the other hand focuses on modular or end-to-end agents trained in simulators like Habitat or AI-Thor where the emphasis is put on photo-realistic rendering and scene diversity but high-fidelity robot motion is assigned a less privileged role. The resulting sim2real gap significantly impacts transfer of the trained models to real robotic platforms. In this work we explore end-to-end training of agents in simulation in settings which minimize the sim2real gap both in sensing and in actuation. Our agent directly predicts (discretized) velocity commands which are maintained through closed-loop control in the real robot. The behavior of the real robot (including the underlying low-level controller) is identified and simulated in a modified Habitat simulator. Noise models for odometry and localization further contribute in lowering the sim2real gap. We evaluate on real navigation scenarios explore different localization and point goal calculation methods and report significant gains in performance and robustness compared to prior work."},

The goal of weakly supervised semantic segmentation is to train segmentation models without using any ground truth segmentation masks. Our work addresses the case where only image-level categorical labels indicating the presence or absence of a particular region of interest (such as tumours or lesions) are available. Most existing methods rely on class activation mapping (CAM). We propose a novel approach ToNNO which is based on the Tomographic reconstruction of a Neural Network's Output. Our technique extracts stacks of slices with different angles from the input 3D volume feeds these slices to a 2D encoder and applies the inverse Radon transform in order to reconstruct a 3D heatmap of the encoder's predictions. This generic method allows to perform dense prediction tasks on 3D volumes using any 2D image encoder. We apply it to weakly supervised medical image segmentation by training the 2D encoder to output high values for slices containing the regions of interest. We test it on four large scale medical image datasets and outperform 2D CAM methods. We then extend ToNNO by combining tomographic reconstruction with CAM methods proposing Averaged CAM and Tomographic CAM which obtain even better results."},

This advancement has spurred a growing interest in incorporating specific identities into generated content. Most current methods employ an inversion approach to embed a target visual concept into the text embedding space using a single reference image. However the newly synthesized faces either closely resemble the reference image in terms of facial attributes such as expression or exhibit a reduced capacity for identity preservation. Text descriptions intended to guide the facial attributes of the synthesized face may fall short owing to the intricate entanglement of identity information with identity-irrelevant facial attributes derived from the reference image. To address these issues we present the novel use of the extended StyleGAN embedding space \\mathcal W _+ to achieve enhanced identity preservation and disentanglement for diffusion models. By aligning this semantically meaningful human face latent space with text-to-image diffusion models we succeed in maintaining high fidelity in identity preservation coupled with the capacity for semantic editing. Additionally we propose new training objectives to balance the influences of both prompt and identity conditions ensuring that the identity-irrelevant background remains \\lxm negligibly affected  during facial attribute modifications.

First we estimate the back-view image from the given reference image by incorporating a style consistency constraint. Then we extract multi-scale features of the two images as conditional and design a diffusion model to generate the Fourier occupancy field in the wavelet domain. We refine the initial estimated Fourier occupancy field with image features as conditions to improve the geometric accuracy. Finally the reference and estimated back-view images are mapped onto the human model creating a textured clothed human model. Substantial experiments are conducted and the experimental results show that our method outperforms the state-of-the-art methods in geometry and texture reconstruction performance."},

While self-supervised pre-training approaches e.g. Masked Autoencoder have shown success in transfer learning task-specific sub-architectures are still required to be appended for different downstream tasks which cannot enjoy the benefits of large-scale pre-training. GLID overcomes this challenge by allowing the pre-trained generalist encoder-decoder to be fine-tuned on various vision tasks with minimal task-specific architecture modifications. In the GLID training scheme pre-training pretext task and other downstream tasks are modeled as \"query-to-answer\" problems including the pre-training pretext task and other downstream tasks. We pre-train a task-agnostic encoder-decoder with query-mask pairs. During fine-tuning GLID maintains the pre-trained encoder-decoder and queries only replacing the topmost linear transformation layer with task-specific linear heads. This minimizes the pretrain-finetune architecture inconsistency and enables the pre-trained model to better adapt to downstream tasks. GLID achieves competitive performance on various vision tasks including object detection image segmentation pose estimation and depth estimation outperforming or matching specialist models such as Mask2Former DETR ViTPose and BinsFormer."},

However this approach suffers from background noise accumulation and loss of density due to the use of broad Gaussian kernels to create the ground truth density maps. This issue can be overcome by narrowing the Gaussian kernel. However existing approaches perform poorly when trained with ground truth density maps with broad kernels. To deal with this limitation we propose using conditional diffusion models to predict density maps as diffusion models show high fidelity to training data during generation. With that we present CrowdDiff that generates the crowd density map as a reverse diffusion process. Furthermore as the intermediate time steps of the diffusion process are noisy we incorporate a regression branch for direct crowd estimation only during training to improve the feature learning. In addition owing to the stochastic nature of the diffusion model we introduce producing multiple density maps to improve the counting performance contrary to the existing crowd counting pipelines. We conduct extensive experiments on publicly available datasets to validate the effectiveness of our method.

However previous works show they are vulnerable to adversarial perturbations that can manipulate their predictions. Given the distinctive modality of point clouds various attack strategies have emerged posing challenges for existing defenses to achieve effective generalization. In this study we for the first time introduce causal modeling to enhance the robustness of point cloud classification models. Our insight is from the observation that adversarial examples closely resemble benign point clouds from the human perspective. In our causal modeling we incorporate two critical variables the structural information (standing for the key feature leading to the classification) and the hidden confounders (standing for the noise interfering with the classification). The resulting overall framework CausalPC consists of three sub-modules to identify the causal effect for robust classification. The framework is model-agnostic and adaptable for integration with various point cloud classifiers. Our approach significantly improves the adversarial robustness of three mainstream point cloud classification models on two benchmark datasets. For instance the classification accuracy for DGCNN on ModelNet40 increases from 29.2% to 72.0% with CausalPC whereas the best-performing baseline achieves only 42.4%."},

We thus propose Iterative 3D Synchronization (I3DS) to mitigate the inconsistency problem via the inherent multi-view consistency property of NeRF.

Recently numerous computer vision methods emerged to automate the process. However observing wild species at remote locations remains a challenging task due to difficult lighting conditions and constraints on power supply and data storage. Event cameras offer unique advantages for battery-dependent remote monitoring due to their low power consumption and high dynamic range capabilities. We use this novel sensor to quantify a behavior in Chinstrap penguins called ecstatic display. We formulate the problem as a temporal action detection task determining the start and end times of the behavior. For this purpose we recorded a colony of breeding penguins in Antarctica for several weeks and labeled event data on 16 nests. The developed method consists of a generator of candidate time intervals (proposals) and a classifier of the actions within them. The experiments show that the event cameras' natural response to motion is effective for continuous behavior monitoring and detection reaching a mean average precision (mAP) of 58% (which increases to 63% in good weather conditions). The results also demonstrate the robustness against various lighting conditions contained in the challenging dataset.

Second the relation types of existing datasets have relatively low-level semantics and can be often recognized by appearance or simple prior information without the need for detailed spatio-temporal context reasoning.

We address two types of OOD generalization i.e. i) domain shift such as natural to sketch images and ii) zero-shot capability to recognize the category that was not contained in the finetune data. Arguably the diminished OOD generalization after finetuning stems from the excessively simplified finetuning target which only provides the class information such as \"a photo of a [CLASS]\". This is distinct from the process in that CLIP was pretrained where there is abundant text supervision with rich semantic information. Therefore we propose to compensate for the finetune process using auxiliary supervision with rich semantic information which acts as anchors to preserve the OOD generalization. Specifically two types of anchors are elaborated in our methods including i) text-compensated anchor which uses the images from the finetune set but enriches the text supervision from a pretrained captioner ii) image-text-pair anchor which is retrieved from the dataset similar to pretraining data of CLIP according to the downstream task associating with the original CLIP text with rich semantics. Those anchors are utilized as auxiliary semantic information to maintain the original feature space of CLIP thereby preserving the OOD generalization capabilities. Comprehensive experiments demonstrate that our method achieves in-distribution performance akin to conventional finetuning while attaining new state-of-the-art results on domain shift and zero-shot learning benchmarks."},

Existing neural radiance fields (NeRF) based solutions learn the deformation in an implicit manner which cannot incorporate 3D scene geometry. Therefore the learned deformation is not necessarily geometrically coherent which results in unsatisfactory dynamic view synthesis and 3D dynamic reconstruction. Recently 3D Gaussian Splatting provides a new representation of the 3D scene building upon which the 3D geometry could be exploited in learning the complex 3D deformation. Specifically the scenes are represented as a collection of 3D Gaussian where each 3D Gaussian is optimized to move and rotate over time to model the deformation. To enforce the 3D scene geometry constraint during deformation we explicitly extract 3D geometry features and integrate them in learning the 3D deformation. In this way our solution achieves 3D geometry-aware deformation modeling which enables improved dynamic view synthesis and 3D dynamic reconstruction. Extensive experimental results on both synthetic and real datasets prove the superiority of our solution which achieves new state-of-the-art performance.

Multiplane image (MPI) is desirable for social media because of its generality but it is complex and computationally expensive making object removal challenging. To address these challenges we propose CORE-MPI which employs embedding images to improve the consistency and accessibility of MPI object removal. CORE-MPI allows for real-time transmission and interaction with embedding images on social media facilitating object removal with a single mask. However recovering the geometric information hidden in the embedding images is a significant challenge. Therefore we propose a dual-network approach where one network focuses on color restoration and the other on inpainting the embedding image including geometric information. For the training of CORE-MPI we introduce a pseudo-reference loss aimed at proficient color recovery even in complex scenes or with large masks. Furthermore we present a disparity consistency loss to preserve the geometric consistency of the inpainted region. We demonstrate the effectiveness of CORE-MPI on RealEstate10K and UCSD datasets."},

While existing works primarily focus on general large motions we contend that the instantaneous detection and quantification of subtle motions is equally important as they indicate the nuances in driving behavior that may be safety critical such as behaviors near a stop sign of parking positions. We delve into this under-explored task examining its unique challenges and developing our solution accompanied by a carefully designed benchmark. Specifically due to the lack of correspondences between consecutive frames of sparse Lidar point clouds static objects might appear to be moving - the so-called swimming effect. This intertwines with the true object motion thereby posing ambiguity in accurate estimation especially for subtle motion. To address this we propose to leverage local occupancy completion of object point clouds to densify the shape cue and mitigate the impact of swimming artifacts. The occupancy completion is learned in an end-to-end fashion together with the detection of moving objects and the estimation of their motion instantaneously as soon as objects start to move. Extensive experiments demonstrate superior performance compared to standard 3D motion estimation approaches particularly highlighting our method's specialized treatment of subtle motion."},

These implicit methods are still confronted by visual artifacts and jitters since the lack of explicit geometric constraints poses a fundamental challenge in accurately modeling complex facial deformations. In this paper we introduce Dynamic Tetrahedra (DynTet) a novel hybrid representation that encodes explicit dynamic meshes by neural networks to ensure geometric consistency across various motions and viewpoints. DynTet is parameterized by the coordinate-based networks which learn signed distance deformation and material texture anchoring the training data into a predefined tetrahedra grid. Leveraging Marching Tetrahedra DynTet efficiently decodes textured meshes with a consistent topology enabling fast rendering through a differentiable rasterizer and supervision via a pixel loss. To enhance training efficiency we incorporate classical 3D Morphable Models to facilitate geometry learning and define a canonical space for simplifying texture learning. These advantages are readily achievable owing to the effective geometric representation employed in DynTet. Compared with prior works DynTet demonstrates significant improvements in fidelity lip synchronization and real-time performance according to various metrics. Beyond producing stable and visually appealing synthesis videos our method also outputs the dynamic meshes which is promising to enable many emerging applications.

To usher in the study of this area we propose MultiPLY a multisensory embodied large language model that could incorporate multisensory interactive data including visual audio tactile and thermal information into large language models thereby establishing the correlation among words actions and percepts. To this end we first collect Multisensory Universe a large-scale multisensory interaction dataset comprising 500k data by deploying an LLM-powered embodied agent to engage with the 3D environment. To perform instruction tuning with pre-trained LLM on such generated data we first encode the 3D scene as abstracted object-centric representations and then introduce action tokens denoting that the embodied agent takes certain actions within the environment as well as state tokens that represent the multisensory state observations of the agent at each time step. In the inference time MultiPLY could generate action tokens instructing the agent to take the action in the environment and obtain the next multisensory state observation. The observation is then appended back to the LLM via state tokens to generate subsequent text or action tokens.

To achieve this goal we propose an iterative object identification (IOI) module which can recognize sound-making objects in an iterative manner. After finding the regions of sound-making objects we devise object similarity-aware clustering (OSC) loss to guide the IOI module to effectively combine regions of the same object but also distinguish between different objects and backgrounds. It enables our method to perform accurate localization of sound-making objects without any prior knowledge.

We propose CAAT a simple but generic and efficient approach that does not require costly training to effectively fool latent diffusion models (LDMs). The approach is based on the observation that cross-attention layers exhibits higher sensitivity to gradient change allowing for leveraging subtle perturbations on published images to significantly corrupt the generated images. We show that a subtle perturbation on an image can significantly impact the cross-attention layers thus changing the mapping between text and image during the fine-tuning of customized diffusion models.

RECAP by design bridges the gap between efficiency and performance through an iterative process cycling between pruning finetuning and updating stages to explore different chunks of the given large-scale model. At each iteration we first prune the model with Taylor-approximation-based importance estimation and then only update a subset of the pruned model weights based on the Fisher-information criterion. In this way RECAP achieves two synergistic and yet conflicting goals: reducing the GPU memory footprint while maintaining model performance unlike most existing pruning methods that require the model to be finetuned beforehand for better preservation of model performance. We perform extensive experiments with a wide range of large transformer-based architectures on various computer vision and natural language understanding tasks. Compared to recent pruning techniques we demonstrate that RECAP offers significant improvements in GPU memory efficiency capable of reducing the footprint by up to 65%."},

Some recent fine-tuning methods have made it feasible for individuals to implant personalized concepts onto the basic Stable Diffusion model with minimal computational costs on small datasets. However these innovations have also given rise to issues like facial privacy forgery and artistic copyright infringement. In recent studies researchers have explored the addition of imperceptible adversarial perturbations to images to prevent potential unauthorized exploitation and infringements when personal data is used for fine-tuning Stable Diffusion. Although these studies have demonstrated the ability to protect images it is essential to consider that these methods may not be entirely applicable in real-world scenarios. In this paper we systematically evaluate the use of perturbations to protect images within a practical threat model. The results suggest that these approaches may not be sufficient to safeguard image privacy and copyright effectively. Furthermore we introduce a purification method capable of removing protected perturbations while preserving the original image structure to the greatest extent possible. Experiments reveal that Stable Diffusion can effectively learn from purified images over all protective methods."},

Typical works focus on learning the new subject's private attributes. However an important fact has not been taken seriously that a subject is not an isolated new concept but should be a specialization of a certain category in the pre-trained model. This results in the subject failing to comprehensively inherit the attributes in its category causing poor attribute-related generations. In this paper motivated by object-oriented programming we model the subject as a derived class whose base class is its semantic category. This modeling enables the subject to inherit public attributes from its category while learning its private attributes from the user-provided example. Specifically we propose a plug-and-play method Subject-Derived regularization (SuDe). It constructs the base-derived class modeling by constraining the subject-driven generated images to semantically belong to the subject's category.

We evaluate a broad variety of semantic segmentation models spanning from conventional close-set models to recent open-vocabulary large models on their robustness to different types of variations. We find that both local and global attribute variations affect segmentation performances and the sensitivity of models diverges across different variation types.

While existing state-of-the-art methods have demonstrated success in reconstructing non-rigid objects using neural field representations conventional feed-forward networks encounter challenges with ambiguous observations from noisy partial or sparse point clouds. To address these challenges we introduce a diffusion model that explicitly learns the shape and motion distribution of non-rigid objects through an iterative denoising process of compressed latent representations. The diffusion-based priors enable more plausible and probabilistic reconstructions when handling ambiguous inputs. We parameterize 4D dynamics with latent sets instead of using global latent codes. This novel 4D representation allows us to learn local shape and deformation patterns leading to more accurate non-linear motion capture and significantly improving generalizability to unseen motions and identities. For more temporally-coherent object tracking we synchronously denoise deformation latent sets and exchange information across multiple frames. To avoid computational overhead we designed an interleaved space and time attention block to alternately aggregate deformation latents along spatial and temporal domains.

While many recent approaches for this task primarily rely on guiding the learning process using the audio modality alone to capture information shared between audio and video we reframe the problem as the acquisition of shared unique (modality-specific) and synergistic speech information to address the inherent asymmetry between the modalities. Based on this formulation we propose a novel \"evolving\" strategy that progressively builds joint audio-visual speech representations that are strong for both uni-modal (audio & visual) and bi-modal (audio-visual) speech. First we leverage the more easily learnable audio modality to initialize audio and visual representations by capturing audio-unique and shared speech information. Next we incorporate video-unique speech information and bootstrap the audio-visual representations on top of the previously acquired shared knowledge. Finally we maximize the total audio-visual speech information including synergistic information to obtain robust and comprehensive representations. We implement ES3 as a simple Siamese framework and experiments on both English benchmarks and a newly contributed large-scale Mandarin dataset show its effectiveness. In particular on LRS2-BBC our smallest model is on par with SoTA models with only 1/2 parameters and 1/8 unlabeled data (223h)."},

It is unclear however how these models behave at scale as more synthetic data is added to the training set. In this paper we study the scaling laws of synthetic images generated by state of the art text-to-image models for the training of supervised models: image classifiers with label supervision and CLIP with language supervision. We identify several factors including text prompts classifier-free guidance scale and types of text-to-image models that significantly affect scaling behavior. After tuning these factors we observe that synthetic images demonstrate a scaling trend similar to but slightly less effective than real images in CLIP training while they significantly underperform in scaling when training supervised image classifiers. Our analysis indicates that the main reason for this underperformance is the inability of off-the-shelf text-to-image models to generate certain concepts a limitation that significantly impairs the training of image classifiers. Our findings also suggest that scaling synthetic data can be particularly effective in scenarios such as: (1) when there is a limited supply of real images for a supervised problem (e.g. fewer than 0.5 million images in ImageNet) (2) when the evaluation dataset diverges significantly from the training data indicating the out-of-distribution scenario or (3) when synthetic data is used in conjunction with real images as demonstrated in the training of CLIP models."},

We address this challenge by introducing state-space models (SSMs) with learnable timescale parameters to event-based vision. This design adapts to varying frequencies without the need to retrain the network at different frequencies. Additionally we investigate two strategies to counteract aliasing effects when deploying the model at higher frequencies. We comprehensively evaluate our approach against existing methods based on RNN and Transformer architectures across various benchmarks including Gen1 and 1 Mpx event camera datasets. Our results demonstrate that SSM-based models train 33% faster and also exhibit minimal performance degradation when tested at higher frequencies than the training input.

In contrast such privilege has not yet fully benefited 3D deep learning mainly due to the limited availability of large-scale 3D datasets. Merging multiple available data sources and letting them collaboratively train a single model is a potential solution. However due to the large domain gap between 3D point cloud datasets such mixed supervision could adversely affect the model's performance and lead to degenerated performance (i.e. negative transfer) compared to single-dataset training. In view of this challenge we introduce Point Prompt Training (PPT) a novel framework for multi-dataset synergistic learning in the context of 3D representation learning that supports multiple pre-training paradigms. Based on this framework we propose Prompt-driven Normalization which adapts the model to different datasets with domain-specific prompts and Language-guided Categorical Alignment that decently unifies the multiple-dataset label spaces by leveraging the relationship between label text. Extensive experiments verify that PPT can overcome the negative transfer associated with synergistic learning and produce generalizable representations.

A broadly received explanation is the tendency of these detectors to be overfitted to forgery-specific artifacts rather than learning features that are widely applicable across various forgeries. To address this issue we propose a simple yet effective detector called LSDA (\\underline L atent \\underline S pace \\underline D ata \\underline A ugmentation) which is based on a heuristic idea: representations with a wider variety of forgeries should be able to learn a more generalizable decision boundary thereby mitigating the overfitting of method-specific features (see Fig. 1). Following this idea we propose to enlarge the forgery space by constructing and simulating variations within and across forgery features in the latent space. This approach encompasses the acquisition of enriched domain-specific features and the facilitation of smoother transitions between different forgery types effectively bridging domain gaps. Our approach culminates in refining a binary classifier that leverages the distilled knowledge from the enhanced features striving for a generalizable deepfake detector.

This framework shifts from absolute one-to-one supervision to optimizing the relational differences in pairwise similarities produced by the query and gallery networks thereby preserving a consistent retrieval order across both networks. Our method involves computing a pairwise similarity differential matrix within the gallery domain which is then decomposed into three components: feature representation knowledge inconsistent pairwise similarity differential knowledge and consistent pairwise similarity differential knowledge. This strategic decomposition aligns the retrieval ranking of the query network with the gallery network effectively.

Recently Learnable 3D lookup tables (3D LUTs) have demonstrated impressive performance and efficiency for image enhancement.

Moreover they uniformly downsample the input image which loses the rich color information and limits the learning of color transformation capabilities. In this paper we present a collaborative transformation framework (CoTF) for real-time exposure correction which integrates global transformation with pixel-wise transformations in an efficient manner. Specifically the global transformation adjusts the overall appearance using image-adaptive 3D LUTs to provide decent global contrast and sharp details while the pixel transformation compensates for local context. Then a relation-aware modulation module is designed to combine these two components effectively. In addition we propose an adaptive sampling strategy to preserve more color information by predicting the sampling intervals thus providing higher quality input data for the learning of 3D LUTs.

Our approach can be applied to any user-defined concept bank as a post-hoc processing method to enhance the performance of any CBMs. Furthermore to measure the descriptive efficiency of CBMs the Concept Utilization Efficiency (CUE) metric is proposed.

Unlike prior work our method conducts a wholistic analysis of a network's activation state leveraging features from all layers and obviating the need to guess which part of the model contains relevant information. Motivated by classic spectral clustering we formulate this analysis in terms of an optimization objective involving a set of affinity matrices each formed by comparing features within a different layer. Solving this optimization problem using gradient descent allows our technique to scale from single images to dataset-level analysis including in the latter both intra- and inter-image relationships. Analyzing a pre-trained generative transformer provides insight into the computational strategy learned by such models. Equating affinity with key-query similarity across attention layers yields eigenvectors encoding scene spatial layout whereas defining affinity by value vector similarity yields eigenvectors encoding object identity. This result suggests that key and query vectors coordinate attentional information flow according to spatial proximity (a `where' pathway) while value vectors refine a semantic category representation (a `what' pathway)."},

In this paper we introduce LANDER (Label Text Centered Data-Free Knowledge Transfer) to address this issue by utilizing label text embeddings (LTE) produced by pretrained language models.

SAM known for its zero-shot generalizability exhibits a performance degradation when faced with datasets with varying image sizes. Previous approaches tend to resize the image to a fixed size or adopt structure modifications hindering the preservation of SAM's rich prior knowledge. Besides such task-specific tuning necessitates a complete retraining of the model which is cost-expensive and unacceptable for deployment in the downstream tasks. In this paper we reformulate this challenge as a length extrapolation problem where token sequence length varies while maintaining a consistent patch size for images with different sizes. To this end we propose a Scalable Bias-Mode Attention Mask (BA-SAM) to enhance SAM's adaptability to varying image resolutions while eliminating the need for structure modifications. Firstly we introduce a new scaling factor to ensure consistent magnitude in the attention layer's dot product values when the token sequence length changes. Secondly we present a bias-mode attention mask that allows each token to prioritize neighboring information mitigating the impact of untrained distant information.

To solve this issue we first deeply analyze the SDS and find that its distillation sampling process indeed corresponds to the trajectory sampling of a stochastic differential equation (SDE): SDS samples along an SDE trajectory to yield a less noisy sample which then serves as a guidance to optimize a 3D model. However the randomness in SDE sampling often leads to a diverse and unpredictable sample which is not always less noisy and thus is not a consistently correct guidance explaining the vulnerability of SDS. Since for any SDE there always exists an ordinary differential equation (ODE) whose trajectory sampling can deterministically and consistently converge to the desired target point as the SDE we propose a novel and effective \"Consistent3D\" method that explores the ODE deterministic sampling prior for text-to-3D generation. Specifically at each training iteration given a rendered image by a 3D model we first estimate its desired 3D score function by a pre-trained 2D diffusion model and build an ODE for trajectory sampling. Next we design a consistency distillation sampling loss which samples along the ODE trajectory to generate two adjacent samples and uses the less noisy sample to guide another more noisy one for distilling the deterministic prior into the 3D model.

Depth estimation is an essential but challenging subtask of monocular 3D object detection due to the ill-posedness of 2D to 3D mapping. Many methods explore multiple local depth clues such as object heights and keypoints and then formulate the object depth estimation as an ensemble of multiple depth predictions to mitigate the insufficiency of single-depth information. However the errors of existing multiple depths tend to have the same sign which hinders them from neutralizing each other and limits the overall accuracy of combined depth. To alleviate this problem we propose to increase the complementarity of depths with two novel designs. First we add a new depth prediction branch named complementary depth that utilizes global and efficient depth clues from the entire image rather than the local clues to reduce the correlation of depth predictions. Second we propose to fully exploit the geometric relations between multiple depth clues to achieve complementarity in form. Benefiting from these designs our method achieves higher complementarity.

However substantial improvements are still impeded by the norm-induced mismatched feature re-calibrations (see Section 1) i.e. the actual importance of a feature can be inconsistent with its explicit intensity such that violates the basic intention of a direct self-gated feature re-weighting. To address this problem we propose to learn discriminative neural feature Act with a novel prototype namely AdaShift which enhances typical self-gated Act by incorporating an adaptive shift factor into the re-weighting function of Act. AdaShift casts dynamic translations on the inputs of a re-weighting function by exploiting comprehensive feature-filter context cues of different ranges in a simple yet effective manner. We obtain the new intuitions of AdaShift by rethinking the feature-filter relationships from a common Softmax-based classification and by generalizing the new observations to a common learning layer that encodes features with updatable filters. Our practical AdaShifts built upon the new Act prototype demonstrate significant improvements to the popular/SOTA Act functions on different vision benchmarks. By simply replacing ReLU with AdaShifts ResNets can match advanced Transformer counterparts (e.g. ResNet-50 vs. Swin-T) with lower cost and fewer parameters."},

Reward-gradient guided denoising has been recently proposed to generate trajectories that maximize both a differentiable reward function and the likelihood under the data distribution captured by a diffusion model. Reward-gradient guided denoising requires a differentiable reward function fitted to both clean and noised samples limiting its applicability as a general trajectory optimizer. In this paper we propose DiffusionES a method that combines gradient-free optimization with trajectory denoising to optimize black-box non-differentiable objectives while staying in the data manifold. Diffusion-ES samples trajectories during evolutionary search from a diffusion model and scores them using a black-box reward function. It mutates high-scoring trajectories using a truncated diffusion process that applies a small number of noising and denoising steps allowing for much more efficient exploration of the solution space. We show that DiffusionES achieves state-of-the-art performance on nuPlan an established closed-loop planning benchmark for autonomous driving. Diffusion-ES outperforms existing sampling-based planners reactive deterministic or diffusion-based policies and reward-gradient guidance. Additionally we show that unlike prior guidance methods our method can optimize non-differentiable language-shaped reward functions generated by few-shot LLM prompting. When guided by a human teacher that issues instructions to follow our method can generate novel highly complex behaviors such as aggressive lane weaving which are not present in the training data. This allows us to solve the hardest nuPlan scenarios which are beyond the capabilities of existing trajectory optimization methods and driving policies."},

Traditional UQ methods often based on Bayesian neural networks are not suitable for pre-trained non-Bayesian models. Our study addresses quantifying epistemic uncertainty for any pre-trained model which does not need the original training data or model modifications and can ensure broad applicability regardless of network architectures or training techniques. Specifically we propose a gradient-based approach to assess epistemic uncertainty analyzing the gradients of outputs relative to model parameters and thereby indicating necessary model adjustments to accurately represent the inputs. We first explore theoretical guarantees of gradient-based methods for epistemic UQ questioning the view that this uncertainty is only calculable through differences between multiple models. We further improve gradient-driven UQ by using class-specific weights for integrating gradients and emphasizing distinct contributions from neural network layers. Additionally we enhance UQ accuracy by combining gradient and perturbation methods to refine the gradients. We evaluate our approach on out-of-distribution detection uncertainty calibration and active learning demonstrating its superiority over current state-of-the-art UQ methods for pre-trained models."},

Previous approaches have focused on either fine-tuning pre-trained T2I models on specific datasets to generate certain kinds of images (e.g. with a specific object or person) or on optimizing the weights text prompts and/or learning features for each input image in an attempt to coax the image generator to produce the desired result. However these approaches all have shortcomings and fail to produce good results in a predictable and controllable manner. To address this problem we present TiNO-Edit an SD-based method that focuses on optimizing the noise patterns and diffusion timesteps during editing something previously unexplored in the literature. With this simple change we are able to generate results that both better align with the original images and reflect the desired result. Furthermore we propose a set of new loss functions that operate in the latent domain of SD greatly speeding up the optimization when compared to prior losses which operate in the pixel domain. Our method can be easily applied to variations of SD including Textual Inversion and DreamBooth that encode new concepts and incorporate them into the edited results.

A few recent studies attempt to tackle a more realistic setting open-set VAD which aims to detect unseen anomalies given seen anomalies and normal videos. However such a setting focuses on predicting frame anomaly scores having no ability to recognize the specific categories of anomalies despite the fact that this ability is essential for building more informed video surveillance systems. This paper takes a step further and explores open-vocabulary video anomaly detection (OVVAD) in which we aim to leverage pre-trained large models to detect and categorize seen and unseen anomalies. To this end we propose a model that decouples OVVAD into two mutually complementary tasks - class-agnostic detection and class-specific classification - and jointly optimizes both tasks. Particularly we devise a semantic knowledge injection module to introduce semantic knowledge from large language models for the detection task and design a novel anomaly synthesis module to generate pseudo unseen anomaly videos with the help of large vision generation models for the classification task. These semantic knowledge and synthesis anomalies substantially extend our model's capability in detecting and categorizing a variety of seen and unseen anomalies. Extensive experiments on three widely-used benchmarks demonstrate our model achieves state-of-the-art performance on OVVAD task."},

However in Optical Character Recognition (OCR) tasks aligning text instances with their corresponding text regions in images poses a challenge as it requires effective alignment between text and OCR-Text (referring to the text in images as OCR-Text to distinguish from the text in natural language) rather than a holistic understanding of the overall image content. In this paper we propose a new pre-training method called OCR-Text Destylization Modeling (ODM) that transfers diverse styles of text found in images to a uniform style based on the text prompt. With ODM we achieve better alignment between text and OCR-Text and enable pre-trained models to adapt to the complex and diverse styles of scene text detection and spotting tasks. Additionally we have designed a new labeling generation method specifically for ODM and combined it with our proposed Text-Controller module to address the challenge of annotation costs in OCR tasks allowing a larger amount of unlabeled data to participate in pre-training. Extensive experiments on multiple public datasets demonstrate that our method significantly improves performance and outperforms current pre-training methods in scene text detection and spotting tasks.

However different background contexts of support and query images can cause their foreground features to be misaligned. This phenomenon known as background context bias can hinder the effectiveness of support prototypes in guiding query image segmentation. In this work we propose a novel framework with an iterative structure to address this problem. In each iteration of the framework we first generate a query prediction based on a support foreground feature. Next we extract background context from the query image to modulate the support foreground feature thus eliminating the foreground feature misalignment caused by the different backgrounds. After that we design a confidence-biased attention to eliminate noise and cleanse information. By integrating these components through an iterative structure we create a novel network that can leverage the synergies between different modules to improve their performance in a mutually reinforcing manner. Through these carefully designed components and structures our network can effectively eliminate background context bias in few-shot segmentation thus achieving outstanding performance. We conduct extensive experiments on the PASCAL-5^ i  and COCO-20^ i  datasets and achieve state-of-the-art (SOTA) results which demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach."},

However strong artifacts can be observed when changing the sampling rate e.g. by changing focal length or camera distance. We find that the source for this phenomenon can be attributed to the lack of 3D frequency constraints and the usage of a 2D dilation filter. To address this problem we introduce a 3D smoothing filter to constrains the size of the 3D Gaussian primitives based on the maximal sampling frequency induced by the input views. It eliminates high-frequency artifacts when zooming in. Moreover replacing 2D dilation with a 2D Mip filter which simulates a 2D box filter effectively mitigates aliasing and dilation issues.

Specifically we first construct coupled HR and LR dictionaries and then encode HR and LR images into a common latent code space using these dictionaries. In addition we develop an autoencoder-based framework to couple these dictionaries during optimization by reconstructing input HR and LR images. The coupled dictionaries enable our method to employ a shallow network architecture with only 18 layers to achieve efficient image SR.

By harnessing large-scale pretrained diffusion models we greatly enhance the applicability of interactive point-based editing on both real and diffusion-generated images. Unlike other diffusion-based editing methods that provide guidance on diffusion latents of multiple time steps our approach achieves efficient yet accurate spatial control by optimizing the latent of only one time step. This novel design is motivated by our observations that UNet features at a specific time step provides sufficient semantic and geometric information to support the drag-based editing.

This paper addresses the training cost and catastrophic forgetting problems when continuously updating models to adapt to incoming small batches from various environments for real-world motion prediction in autonomous driving. To this end we propose a novel continual motion prediction (CMP) learning framework based on sparse meta-representation learning and an optimal memory buffer retention strategy. In meta-representation learning a model explicitly learns a sparse representation of each driving environment from road geometry to vehicle states by training to reduce catastrophic forgetting based on an augmented modulation network with sparsity regularization. Also in the adaptation phase We develop an Optimal Memory Buffer Retention strategy that smartly preserves diverse samples by focusing on representation similarity. This approach handles the nuanced task distribution shifts characteristic of motion prediction datasets ensuring our model stays responsive to evolving input variations without requiring extensive resources.

Moreover the estimates are sensitive to noise in the computed fundamental matrix and to the assumed positions of the principal points. In this paper we therefore propose an efficient and robust iterative method to estimate the focal lengths along with the principal points of the cameras given a fundamental matrix and priors for the estimated camera intrinsics.

However existing FSS methods often underperform in the presence of domain shifts especially when encountering new domain styles that are unseen during training. It is suboptimal to directly adapt or generalize the entire model to new domains in the few-shot scenario. Instead our key idea is to adapt a small adapter for rectifying diverse target domain styles to the source domain. Consequently the rectified target domain features can fittingly benefit from the well-optimized source domain segmentation model which is intently trained on sufficient source domain data. Training domain-rectifying adapter requires sufficiently diverse target domains. We thus propose a novel local-global style perturbation method to simulate diverse potential target domains by perturbating the feature channel statistics of the individual images and collective statistics of the entire source domain respectively. Additionally we propose a cyclic domain alignment module to facilitate the adapter effectively rectifying domains using a reverse domain rectification supervision. The adapter is trained to rectify the image features from diverse synthesized target domains to align with the source domain. During testing on target domains we start by rectifying the image features and then conduct few-shot segmentation on the domain-rectified features.

In this paper we extend the ability of controllable generative models for a more comprehensive hand mesh recovery task: direct hand mesh generation inpainting reconstruction and fitting in a single framework which we name as Holistic Hand Mesh Recovery (HHMR). Our key observation is that different kinds of hand mesh recovery tasks can be achieved by a single generative model with strong multimodal controllability and in such a framework realizing different tasks only requires giving different signals as conditions. To achieve this goal we propose an all-in-one diffusion framework based on graph convolution and attention mechanisms for holistic hand mesh recovery. In order to achieve strong control generation capability while ensuring the decoupling of multimodal control signals we map different modalities to a share feature space and apply cross-scale random masking in both modality and feature levels. In this way the correlation between different modalities can be fully exploited during the learning of hand priors. Furthermore we propose Condition-aligned Gradient Guidance to enhance the alignment of the generated model with the control signals which significantly improves the accuracy of the hand mesh reconstruction and fitting.

To provide precise supervision on the depth of the objects we present a novel Ground-contacting-prior Disparity Smoothness Loss (GDS-Loss) that encourages a DE network to align the depth of the objects with their ground-contacting points. Subsequently in the fine training stage we refine the DE network to learn the detailed depth of the objects from the reprojection loss while ensuring accurate DE on the moving object regions by employing our regularization loss with a cost-volume-based weighting factor. Our overall coarse-to-fine training strategy can easily be integrated with existing DE methods without any modifications significantly enhancing DE performance on challenging Cityscapes and KITTI datasets especially in the moving object regions."},

However conventional models use grids with fixed resolution and range and face computational inefficiencies due to the uniform allocation of resources across all cells. To address this we propose PointBeV a novel sparse BeV segmentation model operating on sparse BeV cells instead of dense grids. This approach offers precise control over memory usage enabling the use of long temporal contexts and accommodating memory-constrained platforms. PointBeV employs an efficient two-pass strategy for training enabling focused computation on regions of interest. At inference time it can be used with various memory/performance trade-offs and flexibly adjusts to new specific use cases. PointBeV achieves state-of-the-art results on the nuScenes dataset for vehicle pedestrian and lane segmentation showcasing superior performance in static and temporal settings despite being trained solely with sparse signals. We release our code with two new efficient modules used in the architecture: Sparse Feature Pulling designed for the effective extraction of features from images to BeV and Submanifold Attention which enables efficient temporal modeling.

Given that the image references are highly biased towards visual attributes state-of-the-art personalization models tend to overfit the whole subject and cannot disentangle visual characteristics in pixel space. In this study we proposed a more challenging setting namely fine-grained visual appearance personalization. Different from existing methods we allow users to provide a sentence describing the desired attributes. A novel decoupled self-augmentation strategy is proposed to generate target-related and non-target samples to learn user-specified visual attributes.These augmented data allow for refining the model's understanding of the target attribute while mitigating the impact of unrelated attributes. At the inference stage adjustments are conducted on semantic space through the learned target and non-target embeddings to further enhance the disentanglement of target attributes. Extensive experiments on various kinds of visual attributes with SOTA personalization methods shows the ability of the proposed method to mimic target visual appearance in novel contexts thus improving the controllability and flexibility of personalization."},

To tackle these problems we propose a Zero-shot instructiON-guided local image Editing approach termed ZONE. We first convert the editing intent from the user-provided instruction (e.g. \"make his tie blue\") into specific image editing regions through InstructPix2Pix. We then propose a Region-IoU scheme for precise image layer extraction from an off-the-shelf segment model. We further develop an edge smoother based on FFT for seamless blending between the layer and the image.Our method allows for arbitrary manipulation of a specific region with a single instruction while preserving the rest.

Intuitively restoration is much easier on text modality than image one. For example it can be easily conducted by removing degradation-related words while keeping the content-aware words. Hence we combine the advantages of images in detail description and ones of text in degradation removal to perform restoration. To address the cross-modal assistance we propose to map the degraded images into textual representations for removing the degradations and then convert the restored textual representations into a guidance image for assisting image restoration. In particular We ingeniously embed an image-to-text mapper and text restoration module into CLIP-equipped text-to-image models to generate the guidance. Then we adopt a simple coarse-to-fine approach to dynamically inject multi-scale information from guidance to image restoration networks. Extensive experiments are conducted on various image restoration tasks including deblurring dehazing deraining and denoising and all-in-one image restoration. The results showcase that our method outperforms state-of-the-art ones across all these tasks. The codes and models are available at https://github.com/mrluin/TextualDegRemoval."},

Despite its straightforward nature as a binary classification task the currently best-performing PU algorithms still largely lag behind the supervised counterpart. In this work we identify that the primary bottleneck lies in the difficulty of deriving discriminative representations under unreliable binary supervision with poor semantics which subsequently hinders the common label disambiguation procedures. To cope with this problem we propose a novel PU learning framework namely Latent Group-Aware Meta Disambiguation (LaGAM) which incorporates a hierarchical contrastive learning module to extract the underlying grouping semantics within PU data and produce compact representations. As a result LaGAM enables a more aggressive label disambiguation strategy where we enhance the robustness of training by iteratively distilling the true labels of unlabeled data directly through meta-learning. Extensive experiments show that LaGAM significantly outperforms the current state-of-the-art methods by an average of 6.8% accuracy on common benchmarks approaching the supervised baseline. We also provide comprehensive ablations as well as visualized analysis to verify the effectiveness of our LaGAM."},

However there are limited studies on adapting from the visible to the thermal domain because the domain gap between the visible and thermal domains is much larger than expected and traditional domain adaptation can not successfully facilitate learning in this situation. To overcome this challenge we propose a Distinctive Dual-Domain Teacher (D3T) framework that employs distinct training paradigms for each domain. Specifically we segregate the source and target training sets for building dual-teachers and successively deploy exponential moving average to the student model to individual teachers of each domain. The framework further incorporates a zigzag learning method between dual teachers facilitating a gradual transition from the visible to thermal domains during training. We validate the superiority of our method through newly designed experimental protocols with well-known thermal datasets i.e. FLIR and KAIST.

Existing methods for tileable texture synthesis focus on general texture quality but lack explicit analysis of the intrinsic repeatability properties of a texture. In contrast our TexTile metric effectively evaluates the tileable properties of a texture opening the door to more informed synthesis and analysis of tileable textures. Under the hood TexTile is formulated as a binary classifier carefully built from a large dataset of textures of different styles semantics regularities and human annotations.Key to our method is a set of architectural modifications to baseline pre-train image classifiers to overcome their shortcomings at measuring tileability along with a custom data augmentation and training regime aimed at increasing robustness and accuracy. We demonstrate that TexTile can be plugged into different state-of-the-art texture synthesis methods including diffusion-based strategies and generate tileable textures while keeping or even improving the overall texture quality. Furthermore we show that TexTile can objectively evaluate any tileable texture synthesis method whereas the current mix of existing metrics produces uncorrelated scores which heavily hinders progress in the field."},

Our GSNeRF is composed of two stages: Semantic Geo-Reasoning and Depth-Guided Visual rendering. The former is able to observe multi-view image inputs to extract semantic and geometry features from a scene. Guided by the resulting image geometry information the latter performs both image and semantic rendering with improved performances. Our experiments not only confirm that GSNeRF performs favorably against prior works on both novel-view image and semantic segmentation synthesis but the effectiveness of our sampling strategy for visual rendering is further verified."},

To address this issue we propose TE-TAD a full end-to-end temporal action detection transformer that integrates time-aligned coordinate expression. We reformulate coordinate expression utilizing actual timeline values ensuring length-invariant representations from the extremely diverse video duration environment. Furthermore our proposed adaptive query selection dynamically adjusts the number of queries based on video length providing a suitable solution for varying video durations compared to a fixed query set. Our approach not only simplifies the TAD process by eliminating the need for hand-crafted components but also significantly improves the performance of query-based detectors.

To overcome these challenges we present a novel framework dubbed TeMO to parse multi-object 3D scenes and edit their styles under the contrast supervision at multiple levels. We first propose a Decoupled Graph Attention (DGA) module to distinguishably reinforce the features of 3D surface points. Particularly a cross-modal graph is constructed to align the object points accurately and noun phrases decoupled from the 3D mesh and textual description. Then we develop a Cross-Grained Contrast (CGC) supervision system where a fine-grained loss between the words in the textual description and the randomly rendered images are constructed to complement the coarse-grained loss.

Although some existing GZSL approaches can alleviate this issue by leveraging additional semantic information from test unseen classes their generalization ability to dissimilar unseen classes is still unsatisfactory. This motivates us to study GZSL in the more practical setting where unseen classes can be either similar or dissimilar to seen classes. In this paper we propose a simple yet effective GZSL framework by exploring diverse semantics from external class names (DSECN) which is simultaneously robust on the similar and dissimilar unseen classes. This is achieved by introducing diverse semantics from external class names and aligning the introduced semantics to visual space using the classification head of pre-trained network. Furthermore we show that the design idea of DSECN can easily be integrate into other advanced GZSL approaches such as the generative-based ones and enhance their robustness for dissimilar unseen classes. Extensive experiments in the practical setting including both similar and dissimilar unseen classes show that our method significantly outperforms the state-of-the-art approaches on all datasets and can be trained very efficiently."},

However we observe that when adopting CLIP to such a pixel-level understanding task unexpected bias occurs. Previous works don't explicitly model such bias which largely constrains the segmentation performance. In this paper we propose to explicitly model and rectify the bias existing in CLIP to facilitate the unsupervised semantic segmentation. Specifically we design a learnable \"Reference\" prompt to encode class-preference bias and project the positional embedding of vision transformer to represent space-preference bias. Via a simple element-wise subtraction we rectify the logits of CLIP classifier. Based on the rectified logits we generate a segmentation mask via a Gumbel-Softmax operation. Then a contrastive loss between masked visual feature and the text features of different classes is imposed to facilitate the effective bias modeling. To further improve the segmentation we distill the knowledge from the rectified CLIP to the advanced segmentation architecture via minimizing our designed mask-guided feature-guided and text-guided loss terms.

Our key insight is to perform unsupervised feature learning in hyperbolic instead of Euclidean space where the distance between points still reflects image similarity yet we gain additional capacity for representing prototypicality with the location of the point: The closer it is to the origin the more prototypical it is. The latter property is simply emergent from optimizing the metric learning objective: The image similar to many training instances is best placed at the center of corresponding points in Euclidean space but closer to the origin in hyperbolic space. We propose an unsupervised feature learning algorithm in Hyperbolic space with sphere pACKing. HACK first generates uniformly packed particles in the Poincar'e ball of hyperbolic space and then assigns each image uniquely to a particle. With our feature mapper simply trained to spread out training instances in hyperbolic space we observe that images move closer to the origin with congealing - a warping process that aligns all the images and makes them appear more common and similar to each other validating our idea of unsupervised prototypicality discovery. We demonstrate that our data-driven prototypicality provides an easy and superior unsupervised instance selection to reduce sample complexity increase model generalization with atypical instances and robustness with typical ones."},

However MLLMs still face a fundamental limitation of hallucinations where they tend to generate erroneous or fabricated information. In this paper we address hallucinations in MLLMs from a novel perspective of representation learning. We first analyzed the representation distribution of textual and visual tokens in MLLM revealing two important findings: 1) there is a significant gap between textual and visual representations indicating unsatisfactory cross-modal representation alignment; 2) representations of texts that contain and do not contain hallucinations are entangled making it challenging to distinguish them. These two observations inspire us with a simple yet effective method to mitigate hallucinations. Specifically we introduce contrastive learning into MLLMs and use text with hallucination as hard negative examples naturally bringing representations of non-hallucinative text and visual samples closer while pushing way representations of non-hallucinating and hallucinative text. We evaluate our method quantitatively and qualitatively showing its effectiveness in reducing hallucination occurrences and improving performance across multiple benchmarks. On the MMhal-Bench benchmark our method obtains a 34.66% /29.5% improvement over the baseline MiniGPT-4/LLaVA. Our code is available on https://github.com/X-PLUG/mPLUG-HalOwl/tree/main/hacl."},

However their performance is significantly contingent upon the quality of textual inputs commonly referred to as \"prompts\". The process of traditional prompt engineering while effective necessitates empirical expertise and poses challenges for inexperienced users. In this paper we introduce PromptCoT an innovative enhancer that autonomously refines prompts for users. PromptCoT is designed based on the observation that prompts which resemble the textual information of high-quality images in the training set often lead to superior generation performance. Therefore we fine-tune the pre-trained Large Language Models (LLM) using a curated text dataset that solely comprises descriptions of high-quality visual content. By doing so the LLM can capture the distribution of high-quality training texts enabling it to generate aligned continuations and revisions to boost the original texts. Nonetheless one drawback of pre-trained LLMs is their tendency to generate extraneous or irrelevant information. We employ the Chain-of-Thought (CoT) mechanism to improve the alignment between the original text prompts and their refined versions. CoT can extract and amalgamate crucial information from the aligned continuation and revision enabling reasonable inferences based on the contextual cues to produce a more comprehensive and nuanced final output. Considering computational efficiency instead of allocating a dedicated LLM for prompt enhancement to each individual model or dataset we integrate adapters that facilitate dataset-specific adaptation leveraging a shared pre-trained LLM as the foundation for this process. With independent fine-tuning of these adapters we can adapt PromptCoT to new datasets while minimally increasing training costs and memory usage. We evaluate the effectiveness of PromptCoT by assessing its performance on widely-used latent diffusion models for image and video generation. The results demonstrate significant improvements in key performance metrics."},

Most existing studies are devoted to designing vision-specific transformers to solve the above problems which introduce additional pre-training costs. Therefore we present a plain pre-training-free and feature-enhanced ViT backbone with Convolutional Multi-scale feature interaction named ViT-CoMer which facilitates bidirectional interaction between CNN and transformer. Compared to the state-of-the-art ViT-CoMer has the following advantages: (1) We inject spatial pyramid multi-receptive field convolutional features into the ViT architecture which effectively alleviates the problems of limited local information interaction and single-feature representation in ViT. (2) We propose a simple and efficient CNN-Transformer bidirectional fusion interaction module that performs multi-scale fusion across hierarchical features which is beneficial for handling dense prediction tasks. (3) We evaluate the performance of ViT-CoMer across various dense prediction tasks different frameworks and multiple advanced pre-training. Notably our ViT-CoMer-L achieves 64.3% AP on COCO val2017 without extra training data and 62.1% mIoU on ADE20K val both of which are comparable to state-of-the-art methods. We hope ViT-CoMer can serve as a new backbone for dense prediction tasks to facilitate future research. The code will be released at https://github.com/Traffic-X/ViT-CoMer."},

Therefore previous straightforward solutions employ resampling techniques to reduce the resolution by adopting a \"Downsampling-Enhancement-Upsampling\" processing paradigm. However this paradigm disentangles the resampling operators and inner enhancement algorithms which results in the loss of information that is favored by the model further leading to sub-optimal outcomes. In this paper we propose a novel method of Learning Model-Aware Resampling (LMAR) which learns to customize resampling by extracting model-aware information from the UHD input image under the guidance of model knowledge. Specifically our method consists of two core designs namely compensatory kernel estimation and steganographic resampling. At the first stage we dynamically predict compensatory kernels tailored to the specific input and resampling scales. At the second stage the image-wise compensatory information is derived with the compensatory kernels and embedded into the rescaled input images. This promotes the representation of the newly derived downscaled inputs to be more consistent with the full-resolution UHD inputs as perceived by the model. Our LMAR enables model-aware and model-favored resampling while maintaining compatibility with existing resampling operators. Extensive experiments on multiple UHD image enhancement datasets and different backbones have shown consistent performance gains after correlating resizer and enhancer e.g. up to 1.2dB PSNR gain for x1.8 resampling scale on UHD-LOL4K.

Event camera is a highly promising alternative for its high dynamic range and dense temporal resolution properties but it lacks key texture appearance for hand mesh reconstruction. In this paper we propose EvRGBHand -- the first approach for 3D hand mesh reconstruction with an event camera and an RGB camera compensating for each other. By fusing two modalities of data across time space and information dimensionsEvRGBHand can tackle overexposure and motion blur issues in RGB-based HMR and foreground scarcity and background overflow issues in event-based HMR. We further propose EvRGBDegrader which allows our model to generalize effectively in challenging scenes even when trained solely on standard scenes thus reducing data acquisition costs. Experiments on real-world data demonstrate that EvRGBHand can effectively solve the challenging issues when using either type of camera alone via retaining the merits of both and shows the potential of generalization to outdoor scenes and another type of event camera. Our code models and dataset will be made public after acceptance."},

While classical depth estimation methods infer only a 2.5D scene representation limited to the image plane recent approaches based on radiance fields reconstruct a full 3D representation. However these methods still struggle with occluded regions since inferring geometry without visual observation requires (i) semantic knowledge of the surroundings and (ii) reasoning about spatial context. We propose KYN a novel method for single-view scene reconstruction that reasons about semantic and spatial context to predict each point's density. We introduce a vision-language modulation module to enrich point features with fine-grained semantic information. We aggregate point representations across the scene through a language-guided spatial attention mechanism to yield per-point density predictions aware of the 3D semantic context. We show that KYN improves 3D shape recovery compared to predicting density for each 3D point in isolation. We achieve state-of-the-art results in scene and object reconstruction on KITTI-360 and show improved zero-shot generalization compared to prior work. Project page: https://ruili3.github.io/kyn"},
{"title": "Your Transferability Barrier is Fragile: Free-Lunch for Transferring the Non-Transferable Learning", "authors": "Ziming Hong, Li Shen, Tongliang Liu", "abstract": "Recently non-transferable learning (NTL) was proposed to restrict models' generalization toward the target domain(s) which serves as state-of-the-art solutions for intellectual property (IP) protection. However the robustness of the established \"transferability barrier\" for degrading the target domain performance has not been well studied. In this paper we first show that the generalization performance of NTL models is widely impaired on third-party domains (i.e. the unseen domain in the NTL training stage). We explore the impairment patterns and find that: due to the dominant generalization of non-transferable task NTL models tend to make target-domain-consistent predictions on third-party domains even though only a slight distribution shift from the third-party domain to the source domain. Motivated by these findings we uncover the potential risks of NTL by proposing a simple but effective method (dubbed as TransNTL) to recover the target domain performance with few source domain data. Specifically by performing a group of different perturbations on the few source domain data we obtain diverse third-party domains that evoke the same impairment patterns as the unavailable target domain. Then we fine-tune the NTL model under an impairment-repair self-distillation framework where the source-domain predictions are used to teach the model itself how to predict on third-party domains thus repairing the impaired generalization. Empirically experiments on standard NTL benchmarks show that the proposed TransNTL reaches up to  72% target-domain improvements by using only 10% source domain data. Finally we also explore a feasible defense method and empirically demonstrate its effectiveness."},

This paper tackles the inherent challenge of content-style duality ensuring a harmonious fusion where the core narrative of the content is both preserved and elevated through stylistic enhancements. We propose a novel Multi-condition Motion Latent Diffusion Model (MCM-LDM) for Arbitrary Motion Style Transfer (AMST). Our MCM-LDM significantly emphasizes preserving trajectories recognizing their fundamental role in defining the essence and fluidity of motion content. Our MCM-LDM's cornerstone lies in its ability first to disentangle and then intricately weave together motion's tripartite components: motion trajectory motion content and motion style. The critical insight of MCM-LDM is to embed multiple conditions with distinct priorities. The content channel serves as the primary flow guiding the overall structure and movement while the trajectory and style channels act as auxiliary components and synchronize with the primary one dynamically. This mechanism ensures that multi-conditions can seamlessly integrate into the main flow enhancing the overall animation without overshadowing the core content. Empirical evaluations underscore the model's proficiency in achieving fluid and authentic motion style transfers setting a new benchmark in the realm of computer animation.

Existing Re-ID methodologies often overlook subtle internal attribute variations which are crucial for accurately identifying individuals with changing appearances. In response our paper introduces the Attribute-Guided Pedestrian Retrieval (AGPR) task focusing on integrating specified attributes with query images to refine retrieval results. Although there has been progress in attribute-driven image retrieval there remains a notable gap in effectively blending robust Re-ID models with intra-class attribute variations. To bridge this gap we present the Attribute-Guided Transformer-based Pedestrian Retrieval (ATPR) framework. ATPR adeptly merges global ID recognition with local attribute learning ensuring a cohesive linkage between the two. Furthermore to effectively handle the complexity of attribute interconnectivity ATPR organizes attributes into distinct groups and applies both inter-group correlation and intra-group decorrelation regularizations. Our extensive experiments on a newly established benchmark using the RAP dataset demonstrate the effectiveness of ATPR within the AGPR paradigm."},

Recent advances focus on establishing a joint embedding space for text and video relying on consistent embedding representations to compute similarity. However the text content in existing datasets is generally short and concise making it hard to fully describe the redundant semantics of a video. Correspondingly a single text embedding may be less expressive to capture the video embedding and empower the retrieval. In this study we propose a new stochastic text modeling method T-MASS i.e. text is modeled as a stochastic embedding to enrich text embedding with a flexible and resilient semantic range yielding a text mass. To be specific we introduce a similarity-aware radius module to adapt the scale of the text mass upon the given text-video pairs. Plus we design and develop a support text regularization to further control the text mass during the training. The inference pipeline is also tailored to fully exploit the text mass for accurate retrieval. Empirical evidence suggests that T-MASS not only effectively attracts relevant text-video pairs while distancing irrelevant ones but also enables the determination of precise text embeddings for relevant pairs. Our experimental results show a substantial improvement of T-MASS over baseline (3% 6.3% by R@1). Also T-MASS achieves state-of-the-art performance on five benchmark datasets including MSRVTT LSMDC DiDeMo VATEX and Charades."},

We achieve this by aligning our UniTouch embeddings to pretrained image embeddings already associated with a variety of other modalities. We further propose learnable sensor-specific tokens allowing the model to learn from a set of heterogeneous tactile sensors all at the same time. UniTouch is capable of conducting various touch sensing tasks in the zero-shot setting from robot grasping prediction to touch image question answering. To the best of our knowledge UniTouch is the first to demonstrate such capabilities."},

In this paper we present a novel decoder-focused method for multi-task dense prediction called Mixture-of-Low-Rank-Experts (MLoRE). To model the global task relationships MLoRE adds a generic convolution path to the original MoE structure where each task feature can go through this path for explicit parameter sharing. Furthermore to control the parameters and computational cost brought by the increase in the number of experts we take inspiration from LoRA and propose to leverage the low-rank format of a vanilla convolution in the expert network. Since the low-rank experts have fewer parameters and can be dynamically parameterized into the generic convolution the parameters and computational cost do not change much with the increase of experts. Benefiting from this design we increase the number of experts and its reception field to enlarge the representation capacity facilitating multiple dense tasks learning in a unified network. Extensive experiments on the PASCAL-Context and NYUD-v2 benchmarks show that our MLoRE achieves superior performance compared to previous state-of-the-art methods on all metrics.

However existing methods produce low-quality scene reconstruction and low-accuracy localization performance when scaling up to large indoor scenes and long sequences. These limitations are mainly due to their single global radiance field with finite capacity which does not adapt to large scenarios. Their end-to-end pose networks are also not robust enough with the growth of cumulative errors in large scenes. To this end we introduce PLGSLAM a neural visual SLAM system capable of high-fidelity surface reconstruction and robust camera tracking in real-time. To handle large-scale indoor scenes PLGSLAM proposes a progressive scene representation method which dynamically allocates new local scene representation trained with frames within a local sliding window. This allows us to scale up to larger indoor scenes and improves robustness (even under pose drifts). In local scene representation PLGSLAM utilizes tri-planes for local high-frequency features with multi-layer perceptron (MLP) networks for the low-frequency feature achieving smoothness and scene completion in unobserved areas. Moreover we propose local-to-global bundle adjustment method with a global keyframe database to address the increased pose drifts on long sequences. Experimental results demonstrate that PLGSLAM achieves state-of-the-art scene reconstruction results and tracking performance across various datasets and scenarios (both in small and large-scale indoor environments)."},

We show that these inversion features enable our detector to generalize well to unseen generators of high visual fidelity (e.g. DALL*E 3) even when the detector is trained only on lower fidelity fake images generated via Stable Diffusion. This detector achieves new state-of-the-art across multiple training and evaluation setups.

We show that the resulting evaluation scores align well with detectors' in-the-wild performance and release these datasets as public benchmarks for future research."},

To facilitate large-scale model training (e.g. open web or unlabeled data) we do not assume access to ground-truth labels and instead estimate pseudo-label policy targets for each video. Our framework comprises three key components: knowledge distillation a sample purification module and an exploration and knowledge retention mechanism. First given sequential image frames we pseudo-label the data and estimate uncertainty using an ensemble of inverse dynamics models. The uncertainty is used to select the most informative samples to add to an experience replay buffer. We specifically select high-uncertainty pseudo-labels to facilitate the exploration and learning of new and diverse driving skills. However in contrast to prior work in continual learning that assumes ground-truth labeled samples the uncertain pseudo-labels can introduce significant noise. Thus we also pair the exploration with a label refinement module which makes use of consistency constraints to re-label the noisy exploratory samples and effectively learn from diverse data. Trained as a complete never-ending learning system we demonstrate state-of-the-art performance on training from domain-changing data as well as millions of images from the open web."},

The current layout-aware text-to-image diffusion models still have several issues including mismatches between the text and layout conditions and quality degradation of generated images.

During the denoising process NoiseCollage independently estimates noises for individual objects and then crops and merges them into a single noise. This operation helps avoid condition mismatches; in other words it can put the right objects in the right places. Qualitative and quantitative evaluations show that NoiseCollage outperforms several state-of-the-art models. These successful results indicate that the crop-and-merge operation of noises is a reasonable strategy to control image generation. We also show that NoiseCollage can be integrated with ControlNet to use edges sketches and pose skeletons as additional conditions. Experimental results show that this integration boosts the layout accuracy of ControlNet. The code is available at https://github.com/univ-esuty/noisecollage."},

While it seems straightforward to extend such editing capability into the video domain there have been fewer works regarding text-guided video inpainting. Given a video a masked region at its initial frame and an editing prompt it requires a model to do infilling at each frame following the editing guidance while keeping the out-of-mask region intact. There are three main challenges in text-guided video inpainting: (i) temporal consistency of the edited video (ii) supporting different inpainting types at different structural fidelity levels and (iii) dealing with variable video length. To address these challenges we introduce Any-Length Video Inpainting with Diffusion Model dubbed as AVID. At its core our model is equipped with effective motion modules and adjustable structure guidance for fixed-length video inpainting. Building on top of that we propose a novel Temporal MultiDiffusion sampling pipeline with a middle-frame attention guidance mechanism facilitating the generation of videos with any desired duration. Our comprehensive experiments show our model can robustly deal with various inpainting types at different video duration ranges with high quality."},

This technical limitation often leads to inadequate segmentation of complex objects with diverse structures. To address this gap we present a novel approach EAGLE which emphasizes object-centric representation learning for unsupervised semantic segmentation. Specifically we introduce EiCue a spectral technique providing semantic and structural cues through an eigenbasis derived from the semantic similarity matrix of deep image features and color affinity from an image. Further by incorporating our object-centric contrastive loss with EiCue we guide our model to learn object-level representations with intra- and inter-image object-feature consistency thereby enhancing semantic accuracy.

Previous attempts rely on well-defined parametric human models or skeletal joints as driving pose sources. However to obtain those clean pose sources cumbersome but necessary pre-processing pipelines are inevitable hindering implementations of the real-time applications. This work is driven by the intuition that the robustness of the model can be enhanced by introducing adversarial samples into the training leading to a more invulnerable model to the noisy inputs which even can be further extended to directly handling the real-world data like raw point clouds/scans without intermediate processing. Furthermore we propose a novel 3D pose Masked Autoencoder (3D-PoseMAE) a customized MAE that effectively learns 3D extrinsic presentations (i.e. pose). 3D-PoseMAE facilitates learning from the aspect of extrinsic attributes by simultaneously generating adversarial samples that perturb the model and learning the arbitrary raw noisy poses via a multi-scale masking strategy. Both qualitative and quantitative studies show that the transferred meshes given by our network result in much better quality.

Recently parameter-efficient fine-tuning (PEFT) which involves freezing a pre-trained model and injecting a small number of learnable parameters to adapt to downstream tasks has gained increasing popularity in continual learning. Although existing continual learning methods based on PEFT have demonstrated superior performance compared to those not based on PEFT most of them do not consider how to eliminate the interference of the new task on the old tasks which inhibits the model from making a good trade-off between stability and plasticity. In this work we propose a new PEFT method called interference-free low-rank adaptation (InfLoRA) for continual learning. InfLoRA injects a small number of parameters to reparameterize the pre-trained weights and shows that fine-tuning these injected parameters is equivalent to fine-tuning the pre-trained weights within a subspace. Furthermore InfLoRA designs this subspace to eliminate the interference of the new task on the old tasks making a good trade-off between stability and plasticity.

PerAda reduces the costs by leveraging the power of pretrained models and only updates and communicates a small number of additional parameters from adapters. PerAda achieves high generalization by regularizing each client's personalized adapter with a global adapter while the global adapter uses knowledge distillation to aggregate generalized information from all clients.

To perform adaptive fusion we introduce a new Contextual Spatial Attention (CSA) module to generate attention maps as fusion weights. The SRU empowers the network to aggregate hidden disparity information across multiple frequencies mitigating the risk of vital hidden disparity information loss during iterative processes. To verify SRU's universality we apply it to representative iterative stereo matching methods collectively referred to as Selective-Stereo. Our Selective-Stereo ranks first on KITTI 2012 KITTI 2015 ETH3D and Middlebury leaderboards among all published methods. Code is available at https://github.com/Windsrain/Selective-Stereo."},

To achieve this goal RAM-Avatar leverages two statistical templates responsible for modeling the facial expression and hand gesture variations while a sparsely computed dual attention module is introduced upon another body template to facilitate high-fidelity texture rendering for the torsos and limbs. Building on this foundation we deploy a lightweight yet powerful StyleUnet along with a temporal-aware discriminator to achieve real-time realistic rendering. To enable robust animation for out-of-distribution poses we propose a Motion Distribution Align module to compensate for the discrepancies between the training and testing motion distribution. Results and extensive experiments conducted in various experimental settings demonstrate the superiority of our proposed method and a real-time live system is proposed to further push research into applications.

Especially to accurately model complex motions high efficiency is usually hard to guarantee. To achieve real-time dynamic scene rendering while also enjoying high training and storage efficiency we propose 4D Gaussian Splatting (4D-GS) as a holistic representation for dynamic scenes rather than applying 3D-GS for each individual frame. In 4D-GS a novel explicit representation containing both 3D Gaussians and 4D neural voxels is proposed. A decomposed neural voxel encoding algorithm inspired by HexPlane is proposed to efficiently build Gaussian features from 4D neural voxels and then a lightweight MLP is applied to predict Gaussian deformations at novel timestamps. Our 4D-GS method achieves real-time rendering under high resolutions 82 FPS at an 800*800 resolution on an RTX 3090 GPU while maintaining comparable or better quality than previous state-of-the-art methods.

RGPT enhances the spatial awareness of regional representation with simple yet effective modifications to existing visual encoders in VLMs. We further improve performance on tasks requiring a specific output scope by integrating task-guided instruction prompts during both training and inference phases while maintaining the model's versatility for general-purpose tasks. Additionally we develop an automated region caption data generation pipeline enriching the training set with detailed region-level captions.

However it can be observed that ambiguities are still inevitable when considering the marginal non-crack region due to low contrast and heterogeneous texture. To solve this problem we propose a novel clustering-inspired representation learning framework which contains a two-phase strategy for automatic crack segmentation. In the first phase a pre-process is proposed to localize the marginal non-crack region. Then we propose an ambiguity-aware segmentation loss (Aseg Loss) that enables crack segmentation models to capture ambiguities in the above regions via learning segmentation variance which allows us to further localize ambiguous regions. In the second phase to learn the discriminative features of the above regions we propose a clustering-inspired loss (CI Loss) that alters the supervision learning of these regions into an unsupervised clustering manner. We demonstrate that the proposed method could surpass the existing crack segmentation models on various datasets and our constructed CrackSeg5k dataset."},

In this paper we propose a novel Domain Separation Graph Neural Network (DSGNN) which starts with separately extracting the shape and texture cues from each object and builds an shape graph as well as a texture graph for all objects in the given image. Then we propose a Shape-Texture Graph Domain Separation (STGDS) module to separate the task-relevant and irrelevant information of target objects by explicitly modelling the relationship between each pair of objects in terms of their shapes and textures respectively. Furthermore a Cross Image Graph Domain Separation (CIGDS) module is introduced to explore the saliency degree subspace that is robust to different scenes aiming to create a unified representation for targets with the same saliency levels in different images.

Recent advancements in multimodal models primarily stem from the powerful reasoning abilities of large language models (LLMs). However the visual component typically depends only on the instance-level contrastive language-image pre-training (CLIP). Our research reveals that the visual capabilities in recent MultiModal LLMs (MLLMs) still exhibit systematic shortcomings. To understand the roots of these errors we explore the gap between the visual embedding space of CLIP and vision-only self-supervised learning. We identify \"CLIP-blind pairs\" - images that CLIP perceives as similar despite their clear visual differences. With these pairs we construct the Multimodal Visual Patterns (MMVP) benchmark. MMVP exposes areas where state-of-the-art systems including GPT-4V struggle with straightforward questions across nine basic visual patterns often providing incorrect answers and hallucinated explanations. We further evaluate various CLIP-based vision-and-language models and found a notable correlation between visual patterns that challenge CLIP models and those problematic for multimodal LLMs. As an initial effort to address these issues we propose a Mixture of Features (MoF) approach demonstrating that integrating vision self-supervised learning features with MLLMs can significantly enhance their visual grounding capabilities.

TDA works with a lightweight key-value cache that maintains a dynamic queue with few-shot pseudo labels as values and the corresponding test-sample features as keys. Leveraging the key-value cache TDA allows adapting to test data gradually via progressive pseudo label refinement which is super-efficient without incurring any backpropagation. In addition we introduce negative pseudo labeling that alleviates the adverse impact of pseudo label noises by assigning pseudo labels to certain negative classes when the model is uncertain about its pseudo label predictions.

Most previous methods rely on the low-light enhancement of a conventional RGB camera. However they would inevitably face a dilemma between the long exposure time of nighttime and the motion blur of dynamic scenes. Event cameras react to dynamic changes with higher temporal resolution (microsecond) and higher dynamic range (120dB) offering an alternative solution. In this work we present a novel nighttime dynamic imaging method with an event camera. Specifically we discover that the event at nighttime exhibits temporal trailing characteristics and spatial non-stationary distribution. Consequently we propose a nighttime event reconstruction network (NER-Net) which mainly includes a learnable event timestamps calibration module (LETC) to align the temporal trailing events and a non-uniform illumination aware module (NIAM) to stabilize the spatiotemporal distribution of events. Moreover we construct a paired real low-light event dataset (RLED) through a co-axial imaging system including 64200 spatially and temporally aligned image GTs and low-light events.

To overcome this limitation we introduce Adam-v2 a new self-supervised learning framework extending Adam [68] by explicitly incorporating part-whole hierarchies into its learning objectives through three key branches: (1) Localizability acquiring discriminative representations to distinguish different anatomical patterns; (2) Composability learning each anatomical structure in a parts-to-whole manner; and (3) Decomposability comprehending each anatomical structure in a whole-to-parts manner. Experimental results across 10 tasks compared to 11 baselines in zero-shot few-shot transfer and full fine-tuning settings showcase Adam-v2's superior performance over large-scale medical models and existing SSL methods across diverse downstream tasks. The higher generality and robustness of Adam-v2's representations originate from its explicit construction of hierarchies for distinct anatomical structures from unlabeled medical images. Adam-v2 preserves a semantic balance of anatomical diversity and harmony in its embedding yielding representations that are both generic and semantically meaningful yet overlooked in existing SSL methods.

But so far those models seem to fall behind when it comes to zero-shot localization of referential expressions and objects in images. As a result they need to be fine-tuned for this task. In this paper we show that pretrained vision-language (VL) models allow for zero-shot open-vocabulary object localization without any fine-tuning. To leverage those capabilities we propose a Grounding Everything Module (GEM) that generalizes the idea of value-value attention introduced by CLIPSurgery to a self-self attention path. We show that the concept of self-self attention corresponds to clustering thus enforcing groups of tokens arising from the same object to be similar while preserving the alignment with the language space. To further guide the group formation we propose a set of regularizations that allows the model to finally generalize across datasets and backbones. We evaluate the proposed GEM framework on various benchmark tasks and datasets for semantic segmentation. GEM not only outperforms other training-free open-vocabulary localization methods but also achieves state-of-the-art results on the recently proposed OpenImagesV7 large-scale segmentation benchmark.

Previous methods usually follow a similar architecture completing the rearrangement task by aligning the scene changes of the goal and shuffled configuration according to the semantic scene graphs. However constructing scene graphs requires the inference of category labels which not only causes the accuracy drop of the entire task but also limits the application in real world scenario. In this paper we delve deep into the essence of visual rearrangement task and focus on the two most essential issues scene change detection and scene change matching. We utilize the movement and the protrusion of point cloud to accurately identify the scene changes and match these changes depending on the similarity of category agnostic appearance feature. Moreover to assist the agent to explore the environment more efficiently and comprehensively we propose a closer-aligned-retrace exploration policy aiming to observe more details of the scene at a closer distance.

It proposes an ISP method featuring three novel technical components: (1) an observer encoder to characterize and integrate an observer's unique attention traits (2) an observer-centric feature integration approach that holistically combines visual features task guidance and observer-specific characteristics and (3) an adaptive fixation prioritization mechanism that refines scanpath predictions by dynamically prioritizing semantic feature maps based on individual observers' attention traits. These novel components allow scanpath models to effectively address the attention variations across different observers. Our method is generally applicable to different datasets model architectures and visual tasks offering a comprehensive tool for transforming general scanpath models into individualized ones.

In this paper we seek to leverage Gaussian splatting to generate realistic animatable avatars from textual descriptions addressing the limitations (e.g. efficiency and flexibility) imposed by mesh or NeRF-based representations. However a naive application of Gaussian splatting cannot generate high-quality animatable avatars and suffers from learning instability; it also cannot capture fine avatar geometries and often leads to degenerate body parts. To tackle these problems we first propose a primitive-based 3D Gaussian representation where Gaussians are defined inside pose-driven primitives to facilitate animations. Second to stabilize and amortize the learning of millions of Gaussians we propose to use implicit neural fields to predict the Gaussian attributes (e.g. colors). Finally to capture fine avatar geometries and extract detailed meshes we propose a novel SDF-based implicit mesh learning approach for 3D Gaussians that regularizes the underlying geometries and extracts highly detailed textured meshes. Our proposed method GAvatar enables the large-scale generation of diverse animatable avatars using only text prompts. GAvatar significantly surpasses existing methods in terms of both appearance and geometry quality and achieves extremely fast rendering (100 fps) at 1K resolution."},

While FL enables learning a model with data privacy it often suffers from significant performance degradation when clients have heterogeneous data distributions. This data heterogeneity causes the model to forget the global knowledge acquired from previously sampled clients after being trained on local datasets. Although the introduction of proximal objectives in local updates helps to preserve global knowledge it can also hinder local learning by interfering with local objectives. Inspired by Continual Learning (CL) we adopt an orthogonal learning strategy to balance these two conflicting objectives. However we observe that directly negating the proximal gradient in the local gradient significantly undermines local learning. To address the problem we propose a novel method Federated Stabilized Orthogonal Learning (FedSOL). FedSOL is designed to identify gradients of local objectives that are inherently orthogonal to directions affecting the proximal objective. Specifically FedSOL targets parameter regions where learning on the local objective is minimally influenced by proximal weight perturbations. Our experiments demonstrate that FedSOL consistently achieves state-of-the-art performance across various scenarios."},

However performance degrades heavily with heterogeneously distributed data. Recent work has shown this is due to the final layer of the network being most prone to local bias some finding success freezing the final layer as an orthogonal classifier. We investigate the training dynamics of the classifier by applying SVD to the weights motivated by the observation that freezing weights results in constant singular values. We find that there are differences when training in IID and non-IID settings. Based on this finding we introduce two regularization terms for local training to continuously emulate IID settings: (1) variance in the dimension-wise probability distribution of the classifier and (2) hyperspherical uniformity of representations of the encoder. These regularizations promote local models to act as if it were in an IID setting regardless of the local data distribution thus offsetting proneness to bias while being flexible to the data. On extensive experiments in both label-shift and feature-shift settings we verify that our method achieves highest performance by a large margin especially in highly non-IID cases in addition to being scalable to larger models and datasets."},

Zico Kolter", "abstract": "Vision-language models (VLMs) are trained for thousands of GPU hours on carefully selected subsets of massive web scrapes. For instance the LAION public dataset retained only about 10 percent of the total crawled data. In recent times data curation has gained prominence with several works developing strategies to retain high-quality subsets of raw scraped data. However these strategies are typically developed agnostic to the available compute for training. In this paper we demonstrate that making filtering decisions independent of training compute is often suboptimal: well-curated data rapidly loses its utility when repeated eventually decreasing below the utility of unseen but lower-quality data. While past research in neural scaling laws has considered web data to be homogenous real data is not. Our work bridges this important gap in the literature by developing scaling laws that characterize the differing utility of various data subsets and accounting for how this diminishes for a data point at its nth repetition. Our key message is that data curation can not be agnostic of the total compute a model will be trained for. Even without ever jointly training on multiple data buckets our scaling laws enable us to estimate model performance under this dynamic trade-off between quality and repetition. This allows us to curate the best possible pool for achieving top performance on Datacomp at various compute budgets carving out a pareto-frontier for data curation."},

In this situation adversarial distillation is a promising option which aims to distill the robustness of the teacher network to improve the robustness of a small student network. Previous works pretrain the teacher network to make it robust against the adversarial examples aimed at itself. However the adversarial examples are dependent on the parameters of the target network. The fixed teacher network inevitably degrades its robustness against the unseen transferred adversarial examples which target the parameters of the student network in the adversarial distillation process.

PeerAiD is an adversarial distillation that trains the peer network and the student network simultaneously in order to specialize the peer network for defending the student network. We observe that such peer networks surpass the robustness of the pretrained robust teacher model against adversarial examples aimed at the student network. With this peer network and adversarial distillation PeerAiD achieves significantly higher robustness of the student network with AutoAttack (AA) accuracy by up to 1.66%p and improves the natural accuracy of the student network by up to 4.72%p with ResNet-18 on TinyImageNet dataset.

In this context we introduce FlowMDM the first diffusion-based model that generates seamless Human Motion Compositions (HMC) without any postprocessing or redundant denoising steps. For this we introduce the Blended Positional Encodings a technique that leverages both absolute and relative positional encodings in the denoising chain. More specifically global motion coherence is recovered at the absolute stage whereas smooth and realistic transitions are built at the relative stage. As a result we achieve state-of-the-art results in terms of accuracy realism and smoothness on the Babel and HumanML3D datasets. FlowMDM excels when trained with only a single description per motion sequence thanks to its Pose-Centric Cross-ATtention which makes it robust against varying text descriptions at inference time.

However progress in 3D lags behind its 2D counterpart due to limited annotated 3D data. To address this recent works first generate 2D open-vocabulary masks through 2D models and then merge them into 3D instances based on metrics calculated between two neighboring frames. In contrast to these local metrics we propose a novel metric view consensus rate to enhance the utilization of multi-view observations. The key insight is that two 2D masks should be deemed part of the same 3D instance if a significant number of other 2D masks from different views contain both these two masks. Using this metric as edge weight we construct a global mask graph where each mask is a node. Through iterative clustering of masks showing high view consensus we generate a series of clusters each representing a distinct 3D instance. Notably our model is training-free.

Existing ZS-TAL methods involve fine-tuning a model on a large amount of annotated training data. While effective training-based ZS-TAL approaches assume the availability of labeled data for supervised learning which can be impractical in some applications. Furthermore the training process naturally induces a domain bias into the learned model which may adversely affect the model's generalization ability to arbitrary videos. These considerations prompt us to approach the ZS-TAL problem from a radically novel perspective relaxing the requirement for training data. To this aim we introduce a novel method that performs Test-Time adaptation for Temporal Action Localization (T3AL). In a nutshell T3AL adapts a pre-trained Vision and Language Model (VLM). T3AL operates in three steps. First a video-level pseudo-label of the action category is computed by aggregating information from the entire video. Then action localization is performed adopting a novel procedure inspired by self-supervised learning. Finally frame-level textual descriptions extracted with a state-of-the-art captioning model are employed for refining the action region proposals. We validate the effectiveness of T 3AL by conducting experiments on the THUMOS14 and the ActivityNet-v1.3 datasets.

To capture temporal dependencies over long horizons prior works either improve framewise features with transformer or refine framewise predictions with learned action features. However they are computationally costly and ignore that frame and action features contain complimentary information which can be leveraged to enhance both features and improve temporal modeling. Therefore we propose an efficient Frame-Action Cross-attention Temporal modeling (FACT) framework that performs temporal modeling with frame and action features in parallel and leverage this parallelism to achieve iterative bidirectional information transfer between the features and refine them. FACT network contains (i) a frame branch to learn frame-level information with convolutions and frame features (ii) an action branch to learn action-level dependencies with transformers and action tokens and (iii) cross-attentions to allow communication between the two branches. We also propose a new matching loss to ensure each action token uniquely encodes an action segment thus better captures its semantics. Thanks to our architecture we can also leverage textual transcripts of videos to help action segmentation.

The existing VLM-based HOI detectors typically adopt a hand-crafted template (e.g. a photo of a person [action] a/an [object]) to acquire text knowledge through the VLM text encoder. However such approaches only encoding the action-specific text prompts in vocabulary level may suffer from learning ambiguity without exploring the fine-grained clues from the perspective of interaction context. In this paper we propose a novel method to discover Syntactic Interaction Clues for HOI detection (SICHOI) by using VLM. Specifically we first investigate what are the essential elements for an interaction context and then establish a syntactic interaction bank from three levels: spatial relationship action-oriented posture and situational condition. Further to align visual features with the syntactic interaction bank we adopt a multi-view extractor to jointly aggregate visual features from instance interaction and image levels accordingly. In addition we also introduce a dual cross-attention decoder to perform context propagation between text knowledge and visual features thereby enhancing the HOI detection. Experimental results demonstrate that our proposed method achieves state-of-the-art performance on HICO-DET and V-COCO."},

Due to the challenging viewpoint of head-mounted cameras the human body is often clipped out of view making traditional image-based egocentric pose estimation challenging. On the other hand headset poses provide valuable information about overall body motion but lack fine-grained details about the hands and feet. To synergize headset poses with cameras we control a humanoid to track headset movement while analyzing input images to decide body movement. When body parts are seen the movements of hands and feet will be guided by the images; when unseen the laws of physics guide the controller to generate plausible motion. We design an end-to-end method that does not rely on any intermediate representations and learns to directly map from images and headset poses to humanoid control signals. To train our method we also propose a large-scale synthetic dataset created using camera configurations compatible with a commercially available VR headset (Quest 2) and show promising results on real-world captures. To demonstrate the applicability of our framework we also test it on an AR headset with a forward-facing camera."},

However existing monocular approaches still struggle to recover fine geometric details such as face hands or cloth wrinkles. They are also easily prone to depth ambiguities that result in distorted geometries along the camera optical axis. In this paper we explore the benefits of incorporating depth observations in the reconstruction process by introducing ANIM a novel method that reconstructs arbitrary 3D human shapes from single-view RGB-D images with an unprecedented level of accuracy. Our model learns geometric details from both multi-resolution pixel-aligned and voxel-aligned features to leverage depth information and enable spatial relationships mitigating depth ambiguities. We further enhance the quality of the reconstructed shape by introducing a depth-supervision strategy which improves the accuracy of the signed distance field estimation of points that lie on the reconstructed surface. Experiments demonstrate that ANIM outperforms state-of-the-art works that use RGB surface normals point cloud or RGB-D data as input.

While diffusion models have been successful their computational intensity has prompted the pursuit of more efficient alternatives. As a representative work non-autoregressive Transformers (NATs) have been recognized for their rapid generation. However a major drawback of these models is their inferior performance compared to diffusion models. In this paper we aim to re-evaluate the full potential of NATs by revisiting the design of their training and inference strategies. Specifically we identify the complexities in properly configuring these strategies and indicate the possible sub-optimality in existing heuristic-driven designs. Recognizing this we propose to go beyond existing methods by directly solving the optimal strategies in an automatic framework. The resulting method named AutoNAT advances the performance boundaries of NATs notably and is able to perform comparably with the latest diffusion models with a significantly reduced inference cost.

Existing methods rely on a large amount of light-stage captured data to learn facial reflectance models. However the lack of subject diversity poses challenges in achieving good generalization and widespread applicability. In this paper we learn the reflectance prior in image space rather than UV space and present a framework named ID2Reflectance. Our framework can directly estimate the reflectance maps of a single image while using limited reflectance data for training. Our key insight is that reflectance data shares facial structures with RGB faces which enables obtaining expressive facial prior from inexpensive RGB data thus reducing the dependency on reflectance data. We first learn a high-quality prior for facial reflectance. Specifically we pretrain multi-domain facial feature codebooks and design a codebook fusion method to align the reflectance and RGB domains. Then we propose an identity-conditioned swapping module that injects facial identity from the target image into the pre-trained auto-encoder to modify the identity of the source reflectance image. Finally we stitch multi-view swapped reflectance images to obtain renderable assets. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our method exhibits excellent generalization capability and achieves state-of-the-art facial reflectance reconstruction results for in-the-wild faces."},

DetCLIPv3 is characterized by three core designs: 1. Versatile model architecture: we derive a robust open-set detection framework which is further empowered with generation ability via the integration of a caption head. 2. High information density data: we develop an auto-annotation pipeline leveraging visual large language model to refine captions for large-scale image-text pairs providing rich multi-granular object labels to enhance the training. 3.

In this paper we propose a novel method BiTT(Bi-directional Texture reconstruction of Two hands) which is the first end-to-end train- able method for relightable pose-free texture reconstruction of two interacting hands taking only a single RGB image by three novel components: 1) bi-directional (left ? right) texture reconstruction using the texture symmetry of left / right hands 2) utilizing a texture parametric model for hand texture recovery and 3) the overall coarse-to-fine stage pipeline for reconstructing personalized texture of two interacting hands. BiTT first estimates the scene light condition and albedo image from an input image then reconstructs the texture of both hands through the texture parametric model and bi-directional texture reconstructor.

Murat Tekalp, Zafer Dogan", "abstract": "Super-resolution (SR) is an ill-posed inverse problem where the size of the set of feasible solutions that are consistent with a given low-resolution image is very large. Many algorithms have been proposed to find a \"good\" solution among the feasible solutions that strike a balance between fidelity and perceptual quality. Unfortunately all known methods generate artifacts and hallucinations while trying to reconstruct high-frequency (HF) image details. A fundamental question is: Can a model learn to distinguish genuine image details from artifacts? Although some recent works focused on the differentiation of details and artifacts this is a very challenging problem and a satisfactory solution is yet to be found. This paper shows that the characterization of genuine HF details versus artifacts can be better learned by training GAN-based SR models using wavelet-domain loss functions compared to RGB-domain or Fourier-space losses. Although wavelet-domain losses have been used in the literature before they have not been used in the context of the SR task. More specifically we train the discriminator only on the HF wavelet sub-bands instead of on RGB images and the generator is trained by a fidelity loss over wavelet subbands to make it sensitive to the scale and orientation of structures. Extensive experimental results demonstrate that our model achieves better perception-distortion trade-off according to multiple objective measures and visual evaluations."},

Achieving decent performance in these tasks often requires fine-tuning various pre-trained models on specific datasets and selecting the best candidate a process that can be both time and resource-consuming. To tackle the problem we introduce a novel and efficient method called RetMMD that leverages Maximum Mean Discrepancy (MMD) and kernel methods to assess the transferability of pretrained models in retrieval tasks. RetMMD is calculated on pretrained model and target dataset without any fine-tuning involved. Specifically given some query we quantify the distribution discrepancy between relevant and irrelevant document embeddings by estimating the similarities within their mappings in the fine-tuned embedding space through kernel method. This discrepancy is averaged over multiple queries taking into account the distribution characteristics of the target dataset. Experiments suggest that the proposed metric calculated on pre-trained models closely aligns with retrieval performance post-fine-tuning. The observation holds across a variety of datasets including image text and multi-modal domains indicating the potential of using MMD and kernel methods for transfer learning evaluation in retrieval scenarios. In addition we also design a way of evaluating dataset transferability for retrieval tasks with experimental results demonstrating the effectiveness of the proposed approach."},

However directly aggregating adjacent costs can lead to suboptimal results due to local geometric inconsistency. Related methods either seek selective aggregation or improve aggregated depth in the 2D space both are unable to handle geometric inconsistency in the cost volume effectively. In this paper we propose GoMVS to aggregate geometrically consistent costs yielding better utilization of adjacent geometries. More specifically we correspond and propagate adjacent costs to the reference pixel by leveraging the local geometric smoothness in conjunction with surface normals. We achieve this by the geometric consistent propagation (GCP) module. It computes the correspondence from the adjacent depth hypothesis space to the reference depth space using surface normals then uses the correspondence to propagate adjacent costs to the reference geometry followed by a convolution for aggregation.

Our motivation stems from the observation that 1) existing symmetric teacher-student methods for semi-supervised 3D object detection have characterized simplicity but impede the distillation performance between teacher and student because of the demand for an identical model structure and input data format. 2) The offline asymmetric methods with a complex teacher model constructed differently can generate more precise pseudo-labels but is challenging to jointly optimize the teacher and student model. Consequently in this paper we devise a different path from the conventional paradigm which can harness the capacity of a strong teacher while preserving the advantages of online teacher model updates. The essence is the proposed attention-based refinement model that can be seamlessly integrated into a vanilla teacher. The refinement model works in the divide-and-conquer manner that respectively handles three challenging scenarios including 1) objects detected in the current timestamp but with suboptimal box quality 2) objects are missed in the current timestamp but are detected in past or future frames 3) objects are neglected in all frames. It is worth noting that even while tackling these complex cases our model retains the efficiency of the online teacher-student semi-supervised framework.

{"title": "Construct to Associate: Cooperative Context Learning for Domain Adaptive Point Cloud Segmentation", "authors": "Guangrui Li", "abstract": "This paper tackles the domain adaptation problem in point cloud semantic segmentation which performs adaptation from a fully labeled domain (source domain) to an unlabeled target domain. Due to the unordered property of point clouds LiDAR scans typically show varying geometric structures across different regions in terms of density noises etc hence leading to increased dynamics on context. However such characteristics are not consistent across domains due to the difference in sensors environments etc thus hampering the effective scene comprehension across domains. To solve this we propose Cooperative Context Learning that performs context modeling and modulation from different aspects but in a cooperative manner. Specifically we first devise context embeddings to discover and model contextual relationships with close neighbors in a learnable manner. Then with the context embeddings from two domains we introduce a set of learnable prototypes to attend and associate them under the attention paradigm. As a result these prototypes naturally establish long-range dependency across regions and domains thereby encouraging the transfer of context knowledge and easing the adaptation. Moreover the attention in turn attunes and guides the local context modeling and urges them to focus on the domain-invariant context knowledge thus promoting the adaptation in a cooperative manner. Experiments on representative benchmarks verify that our method attains the new state-of-the-art."},

Ali, Saurav Prakash, Salman Avestimehr", "abstract": "Data privacy is of great concern in cloud machine-learning service platforms when sensitive data are exposed to service providers. While private computing environments (e.g. secure enclaves) and cryptographic approaches (e.g. homomorphic encryption) provide strong privacy protection their computing performance still falls short compared to cloud GPUs. To achieve privacy protection with high computing performance we propose Delta a new private training and inference framework with comparable model performance as non-private centralized training. Delta features two asymmetric data flows: the main information-sensitive flow and the residual flow. The main part flows into a small model while the residuals are offloaded to a large model. Specifically Delta embeds the information-sensitive representations into a low-dimensional space while pushing the information-insensitive part into high-dimension residuals. To ensure privacy protection the low-dimensional information-sensitive part is secured and fed to a small model in a private environment. On the other hand the residual part is sent to fast cloud GPUs and processed by a large model. To further enhance privacy and reduce the communication cost Delta applies a random binary quantization technique along with a DP-based technique to the residuals before sharing them with the public platform. We theoretically show that Delta guarantees differential privacy in the public environment and greatly reduces the complexity in the private environment. We conduct empirical analyses on CIFAR-10 CIFAR-100 and ImageNet datasets and ResNet-18 and ResNet-34 showing that Delta achieves strong privacy protection fast training and inference without significantly compromising the model utility."},

Although the long-term memory aligns better with the persistent nature of the VLN task it poses more challenges on how to utilize the highly unstructured navigation memory with extremely sparse supervision. Towards this end we propose OVER-NAV which aims to go over and beyond the current arts of IVLN techniques. In particular we propose to incorporate LLMs and open-vocabulary detectors to distill key information and establish correspondence between multi-modal signals. Such a mechanism introduces reliable cross-modal supervision and enables on-the-fly generalization to unseen scenes without the need of extra annotation and re-training. To fully exploit the interpreted navigation data we further introduce a structured representation coded Omnigraph to effectively integrate multi-modal information along the tour. Accompanied with a novel omnigraph fusion mechanism OVER-NAV is able to extract the most relevant knowledge from omnigraph for a more accurate navigating action. In addition OVER-NAV seamlessly supports both discrete and continuous environments under a unified framework. We demonstrate the superiority of OVER-NAV in extensive experiments."},

Meyer, Yuning Chai, Dennis Park, Yong Jae Lee", "abstract": "While existing large vision-language multimodal models focus on whole image understanding there is a prominent gap in achieving region-specific comprehension. Current approaches that use textual coordinates or spatial encodings often fail to provide a user-friendly interface for visual prompting. To address this challenge we introduce a novel multimodal model capable of decoding arbitrary (free-form) visual prompts. This allows users to intuitively mark images and interact with the model using natural cues like a \"red bounding box\" or \"pointed arrow'\". Our simple design directly overlays visual markers onto the RGB image eliminating the need for complex region encodings yet achieves state-of-the-art performance on region-understanding tasks like Visual7W PointQA and Visual Commonsense Reasoning benchmark. Furthermore we present ViP-Bench a comprehensive benchmark to assess the capability of models in understanding visual prompts across multiple dimensions enabling future research in this domain.

{"title": "SIGNeRF: Scene Integrated Generation for Neural Radiance Fields", "authors": "Jan-Niklas Dihlmann, Andreas Engelhardt, Hendrik Lensch", "abstract": "Advances in image diffusion models have recently led to notable improvements in the generation of high-quality images. In combination with Neural Radiance Fields (NeRFs) they enabled new opportunities in 3D generation. However most generative 3D approaches are object-centric and applying them to editing existing photorealistic scenes is not trivial. We propose SIGNeRF a novel approach for fast and controllable NeRF scene editing and scene-integrated object generation. A new generative update strategy ensures 3D consistency across the edited images without requiring iterative optimization. We find that depth-conditioned diffusion models inherently possess the capability to generate 3D consistent views by requesting a grid of images instead of single views. Based on these insights we introduce a multi-view reference sheet of modified images. Our method updates an image collection consistently based on the reference sheet and refines the original NeRF with the newly generated image set in one go. By exploiting the depth conditioning mechanism of the image diffusion model we gain fine control over the spatial location of the edit and enforce shape guidance by a selected region or an external mesh."},

Current state-of-the-art methods train the labeled data with ground truths and unlabeled data with pseudo labels. However the two training flows are separate which allows labeled data to dominate the training process resulting in low-quality pseudo labels and consequently sub-optimal results. To alleviate this issue we present AllSpark which reborns the labeled features from unlabeled ones with the channel-wise cross-attention mechanism. We further introduce a Semantic Memory along with a Channel Semantic Grouping strategy to ensure that unlabeled features adequately represent labeled features. The AllSpark shed new light on the architecture level designs of SSSS rather than framework level which avoids increasingly complicated training pipeline designs. It can also be regarded as a flexible bottleneck module that can be seamlessly integrated into a general transformer-based segmentation model.

Variability allows the avatar to exhibit a wide range of motions even with similar speech content while coordination ensures a harmonious alignment among facial expressions hand gestures and body poses. We aim to achieve both with ProbTalk a unified probabilistic framework designed to jointly model facial hand and body movements in speech. ProbTalk builds on the variational autoencoder (VAE) architecture and incorporates three core designs. First we introduce product quantization (PQ) to the VAE which enriches the representation of complex holistic motion. Second we devise a novel non-autoregressive model that embeds 2D positional encoding into the product-quantized representation thereby preserving essential structure information of the PQ codes. Last we employ a secondary stage to refine the preliminary prediction further sharpening the high-frequency details. Coupling these three designs enables ProbTalk to generate natural and diverse holistic co-speech motions outperforming several state-of-the-art methods in qualitative and quantitative evaluations particularly in terms of realism.

In this research we propose YolOOD - a method that utilizes concepts from the object detection domain to perform OOD detection in the multi-label classification task. Object detection models have an inherent ability to distinguish between objects of interest (in-distribution data) and irrelevant objects (OOD data) in images that contain multiple objects belonging to different class categories. These abilities allow us to convert a regular object detection model into an image classifier with inherent OOD detection capabilities with just minor changes.

MMVP provides accurate and dense plantar pressure signals synchronized with RGBD observations which is especially useful for both plausible shape estimation robust pose fitting without foot drifting and accurate global translation tracking.

However due to the enormous diversity in input-output formats in the vision domain existing general-purpose models fail to successfully integrate segmentation and multi-image inputs with coarse-level tasks into a single framework. In this work we introduce VistaLLM a powerful visual system that addresses coarse- and fine grained VL tasks over single and multiple input images using a unified framework. VistaLLM utilizes an instruction-guided image tokenizer that filters global embeddings using task descriptions to extract compressed and refined features from numerous images.

Compared with single modality existing methods adopt a fusion strategy to directly fuse the cross-modal complementary knowledge in motion space. However these direct fusion methods may suffer the modality gap due to the visual intrinsic heterogeneous nature between RGB and LiDAR thus deteriorating motion features. We discover that event has the homogeneous nature with RGB and LiDAR in both visual and motion spaces. In this work we bring the event as a bridge between RGB and LiDAR and propose a novel hierarchical visual-motion fusion framework for scene flow which explores a homogeneous space to fuse the cross-modal complementary knowledge for physical interpretation. In visual fusion we discover that event has a complementarity (relative v.s. absolute) in luminance space with RGB for high dynamic imaging and has a complementarity (local boundary v.s. global shape) in scene structure space with LiDAR for structure integrity. In motion fusion we figure out that RGB event and LiDAR are complementary (spatial-dense temporal-dense v.s. spatiotemporal-sparse) to each other in correlation space which motivates us to fuse their motion correlations for motion continuity. The proposed hierarchical fusion can explicitly fuse the multimodal knowledge to progressively improve scene flow from visual space to motion space.

When adopting diffusion models for image restoration the crucial challenge lies in how to preserve high-level image fidelity in the randomness diffusion process and generate accurate background structures and realistic texture details. In this paper we propose a general framework and develop a Diffusion Texture Prior Model (DTPM) for image restoration tasks. DTPM explicitly models high-quality texture details through the diffusion process rather than global contextual content. In phase one of the training stage we pre-train DTPM on approximately 55K high-quality image samples after which we freeze most of its parameters. In phase two we insert conditional guidance adapters into DTPM and equip it with an initial predictor thereby facilitating its rapid adaptation to downstream image restoration tasks. Our DTPM could mitigate the randomness of traditional diffusion models by utilizing encapsulated rich and diverse texture knowledge and background structural information provided by the initial predictor during the sampling process. Our comprehensive evaluations of five image restoration tasks demonstrate DTPM's superiority over existing regression and diffusion-based image restoration methods in perceptual quality and its exceptional generalization capabilities."},

However they may still face limitations in effectively distinguishing between the most challenging OOD samples that are much like in-distribution (ID) data i.e. ID-like samples. To this end we propose a novel OOD detection framework that discovers ID-like outliers using CLIP from the vicinity space of the ID samples thus helping to identify these most challenging OOD samples. Then a prompt learning framework is proposed that utilizes the identified ID-like outliers to further leverage the capabilities of CLIP for OOD detection. Benefiting from the powerful CLIP we only need a small number of ID samples to learn the prompts of the model without exposing other auxiliary outlier datasets. By focusing on the most challenging ID-like OOD samples and elegantly exploiting the capabilities of CLIP our method achieves superior few-shot learning performance on various real-world image datasets (e.g. in 4-shot OOD detection on the ImageNet-1k dataset our method reduces the average FPR95 by 12.16% and improves the average AUROC by 2.76% compared to state-of-the-art methods)."},

In this work we present a method that automatically adds motion to a single-subject sketch (hence \"breathing life into it\") merely by providing a text prompt indicating the desired motion. The output is a short animation provided in vector representation which can be easily edited. Our method does not require extensive training but instead leverages the motion prior of a large pretrained text-to-video diffusion model using a score-distillation loss to guide the placement of strokes. To promote natural and smooth motion and to better preserve the sketch's appearance we model the learned motion through two components. The first governs small local deformations and the second controls global affine transformations.

In this paper we propose EYOC an unsupervised distant point cloud registration method that adapts to new point cloud distributions on the fly requiring no global pose labels. The core idea of EYOC is to train a feature extractor in a progressive fashion where in each round the feature extractor trained with near point cloud pairs can label slightly farther point cloud pairs enabling self-supervision on such far point cloud pairs. This process continues until the derived extractor can be used to register distant point clouds. Particularly to enable high-fidelity correspondence label generation we devise an effective spatial filtering scheme to select the most representative correspondences to register a point cloud pair and then utilize the aligned point clouds to discover more correct correspondences. Experiments show that EYOC can achieve comparable performance with state-of-the-art supervised methods at a lower training cost.

Despite its significance research on in-vehicle gaze estimation remains limited due to the scarcity of comprehensive and well-annotated datasets in real driving scenarios. In this paper we present three novel elements to advance in-vehicle gaze research. Firstly we introduce IVGaze a pioneering dataset capturing in-vehicle gaze collected from 125 individuals and covering a large range of gaze and head within vehicles. Conventional gaze collection systems are inadequate for in-vehicle use. In this dataset we propose a new vision-based solution for in-vehicle gaze collection introducing a refined gaze target calibration method to tackle annotation challenges. Second our research focuses on in-vehicle gaze estimation leveraging the IVGaze. Images of in-vehicle faces often suffer from low resolution prompting our introduction of a gaze pyramid transformer that harnesses transformer-based multilevel features integration. Expanding upon this we introduce the dual-stream gaze pyramid transformer (GazeDPTR). Employing perspective transformation we rotate virtual cameras to normalize images utilizing camera pose to merge normalized and original images for accurate gaze estimation. GazeDPTR showcases state-of-the-art performance on the IVGaze dataset. Thirdly we explore a novel strategy for gaze zone classification by extending the GazeDPTR.

In light of the advancements in current multi-modal large language models we explore their effectiveness in counterfactual reasoning. To facilitate this investigation we introduce a novel dataset C-VQA specifically designed to examine the counterfactual reasoning capabilities of modern multi-modal large language models. This dataset is constructed by infusing original questions with counterfactual presuppositions spanning various types such as numerical and boolean queries. It encompasses a mix of real and synthetic data representing a wide range of difficulty levels. Our thorough evaluations of contemporary vision-language models using this dataset have revealed substantial performance drops with some models showing up to a 40% decrease highlighting a significant gap between current models and human-like vision reasoning capabilities. We hope our dataset will serve as a vital benchmark for evaluating the counterfactual reasoning capabilities of models. Code and dataset are publicly available at https://bzhao.me/C-VQA/."},

To tackle with this issue we present a novel strategy from the view of shadow transformation in this paper: directly homogenizing the spatial distribution of shadow degradation. Our key design is the random shuffle operation and its corresponding inverse operation. Specifically random shuffle operation stochastically rearranges the pixels across spatial space and the inverse operation recovers the original order. After randomly shuffling the shadow diffuses in the whole image and the degradation appears in a homogenized way which can be effectively processed by the local self-attention layer. Moreover we further devise a new feed forward network with position modeling to exploit image structural information. Based on these elements we construct the final local window based transformer named HomoFormer for image shadow removal. Our HomoFormer can enjoy the linear complexity of local transformers while bypassing challenges of non-uniformity and diversity of shadow. Extensive experiments are conducted to verify the superiority of our HomoFormer across public datasets."},

This paper introduces DNGaussian a depth-regularized framework based on 3D Gaussian radiance fields offering real-time and high-quality few-shot novel view synthesis at low costs. Our motivation stems from the highly efficient representation and surprising quality of the recent 3D Gaussian Splatting despite it will encounter a geometry degradation when input views decrease. In the Gaussian radiance fields we find this degradation in scene geometry primarily lined to the positioning of Gaussian primitives and can be mitigated by depth constraint. Consequently we propose a Hard and Soft Depth Regularization to restore accurate scene geometry under coarse monocular depth supervision while maintaining a fine-grained color appearance. To further refine detailed geometry reshaping we introduce Global-Local Depth Normalization enhancing the focus on small local depth changes. Extensive experiments on LLFF DTU and Blender datasets demonstrate that DNGaussian outperforms state-of-the-art methods achieving comparable or better results with significantly reduced memory cost a 25x reduction in training time and over 3000x faster rendering speed.

We design a Hierarchical Color Enhanced Feature Extraction module to extract multi-level geometric-color features and a GeoColor Superpoint Matching Module to encode transformation-invariant geo-color global context for robust patch correspondences. In this way both geometric and color data can be used thus lead to robust performance even under extremely challenging scenarios such as low overlap between two point clouds. To evaluate the performance of our method we colorize 3DMatch/3DLoMatch datasets as Color3DMatch/Color3DLoMatch and evaluations on these datasets demonstrate the effectiveness of our proposed method.

However autonomous vehicles and robots in-the-wild require constant re-calibration due to exposure to various environmental factors including vibration and structural stress when cameras are arranged in a wide-baseline configuration. Conventional rectification methods fail in these challenging scenarios: especially for larger vehicles such as autonomous freight trucks and semi-trucks the resulting incorrect rectification severely affects the quality of downstream tasks that use stereo/multi-view data. To tackle these challenges we propose an online rectification approach that operates at real-time rates while achieving high accuracy. We propose a novel learning-based online calibration approach that utilizes stereo correlation volumes built from a feature representation obtained from cross-image attention. Our model is trained to minimize vertical optical flow as proxy rectification constraint and predicts the relative rotation between the stereo pair. The method is real-time and even outperforms conventional methods used for offline calibration and substantially improves downstream stereo depth post-rectification.

Coherence-Aware Training Benefits Conditional Diffusion", "authors": "Nicolas Dufour, Victor Besnier, Vicky Kalogeiton, David Picard", "abstract": "Conditional diffusion models are powerful generative models that can leverage various types of conditional information such as class labels segmentation masks or text captions. However in many real-world scenarios conditional information may be noisy or unreliable due to human annotation errors or weak alignment. In this paper we propose the Coherence-Aware Diffusion (CAD) a novel method to integrate confidence in conditional information into diffusion models allowing them to learn from noisy annotations without discarding data. We assume that each data point has an associated confidence score that reflects the quality of the conditional information. We then condition the diffusion model on both the conditional information and the confidence score. In this way the model learns to ignore or discount the conditioning when the confidence is low. We show that our method is theoretically sound and empirically effective on various conditional generation tasks. Moreover we show that leveraging confidence generates realistic and diverse samples that respect conditional information better than models trained on cleaned datasets where samples with low confidence have been discarded."},

Baking neural SDFs can extract explicit mesh with appearance baked into texture maps as neural features. The baked meshes still have a large memory footprint and require a powerful GPU for real-time rendering. Neural optimization of such large meshes with differentiable rendering pose significant challenges. We propose a method to produce optimized meshes for large unbounded scenes with low triangle budget and high fidelity of geometry and appearance. We achieve this by combining advancements in baking neural SDFs with classical mesh simplification techniques and proposing a joint appearance-geometry refinement step. The visual quality is comparable to or better than state-of-the-art neural meshing and baking methods with high geometric accuracy despite significant reduction in triangle count making the produced meshes efficient for storage transmission and rendering on mobile hardware.

Recent pedestrian animation frameworks have a significant limitation wherein they primarily focus on either following trajectory or the content of the reference video consequently overlooking the potential diversity of human motion within such scenarios. This limitation restricts the ability to generate pedestrian behaviors that exhibit a wider range of variations and realistic motions and therefore restricts its usage to provide rich motion content for other components in the driving simulation system e.g. suddenly changed motion to which the autonomous vehicle should respond. In our approach we strive to surpass the limitation by showcasing diverse human motions obtained from various sources such as generated human motions in addition to following the given trajectory. The fundamental contribution of our framework lies in combining the motion tracking task with trajectory following which enables the tracking of specific motion parts (e.g. upper body) while simultaneously following the given trajectory by a single policy. This way we significantly enhance both the diversity of simulated human motion within the given scenario and the controllability of the content including language-based control. Our framework facilitates the generation of a wide range of human motions contributing to greater realism and adaptability in pedestrian simulations for driving scenarios."},

Recently the spectra-wise transformer has shown great potential in capturing inter-spectra similarities of HSI but the classic design of the transformer i.e. multi-head division in the spectral (channel) dimension hinders the modeling of global spectral information and results in mean effect. In addition previous methods adopt the normal spatial priors without taking imaging processes into account and fail to address the unique spatial degradation in snapshot spectral reconstruction. In this paper we analyze the influence of multi-head division and propose a novel Spectral-Spatial Rectification (SSR) method to enhance the utilization of spectral information and improve spatial degradation. Specifically SSR includes two core parts: Window-based Spectra-wise Self-Attention (WSSA) and spAtial Rectification Block (ARB). WSSA is proposed to capture global spectral information and account for local differences whereas ARB aims to mitigate the spatial degradation using a spatial alignment strategy. The experimental results on simulation and real scenes demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed modules and we also provide models at multiple scales to demonstrate the superiority of our approach."},

Gonzalez, Boyi Li, Trevor Darrell", "abstract": "Text-to-image generation has witnessed significant progress with the advent of diffusion models. Despite the ability to generate photorealistic images current text-to-image diffusion models still often struggle to accurately interpret and follow complex input text prompts. In contrast to existing models that aim to generate images only with their best effort we introduce Self-correcting LLM-controlled Diffusion (SLD). SLD is a framework that generates an image from the input prompt assesses its alignment with the prompt and performs self-corrections on the inaccuracies in the generated image. Steered by an LLM controller SLD turns text-to-image generation into an iterative closed-loop process ensuring correctness in the resulting image. SLD is not only training-free but can also be seamlessly integrated with diffusion models behind API access such as DALL-E 3 to further boost the performance of state-of-the-art diffusion models. Experimental results show that our approach can rectify a majority of incorrect generations particularly in generative numeracy attribute binding and spatial relationships. Furthermore by simply adjusting the instructions to the LLM SLD can perform image editing tasks bridging the gap between text-to-image generation and image editing pipelines.

Additionally our work is the first to perform retrieval over location clusters for guess refinements. We train two models for evaluations on street-level data and general-purpose image geolocalization; the first model PIGEON is trained on data from the game of GeoGuessr and is capable of placing over 40% of its guesses within 25 kilometers of the target location globally. We also develop a bot and deploy PIGEON in a blind experiment against humans ranking in the top 0.01% of players.

This symbolic representation is a high-level abstraction of the real world which may render the motion prediction model vulnerable to perception errors (e.g. failures in detecting open-vocabulary obstacles) while missing salient information from the scene context (e.g. poor road conditions). An alternative paradigm is end-to-end learning from raw sensors. However this approach suffers from the lack of interpretability and requires significantly more training resources. In this work we propose tokenizing the visual world into a compact set of scene elements and then leveraging pre-trained image foundation models and LiDAR neural networks to encode all the scene elements in an open-vocabulary manner. The image foundation model enables our scene tokens to encode the general knowledge of the open world while the LiDAR neural network encodes geometry information. Our proposed representation can efficiently encode the multi-frame multi-modality observations with a few hundred tokens and is compatible with most transformer-based architectures.

Modeling a 3D language field to support open-ended language queries in 3D has gained increasing attention recently. This paper introduces LangSplat which constructs a 3D language field that enables precise and efficient open-vocabulary querying within 3D spaces. Unlike existing methods that ground CLIP language embeddings in a NeRF model LangSplat advances the field by utilizing a collection of 3D Gaussians each encoding language features distilled from CLIP to represent the language field. By employing a tile-based splatting technique for rendering language features we circumvent the costly rendering process inherent in NeRF. Instead of directly learning CLIP embeddings LangSplat first trains a scene-wise language autoencoder and then learns language features on the scene-specific latent space thereby alleviating substantial memory demands imposed by explicit modeling. Existing methods struggle with imprecise and vague 3D language fields which fail to discern clear boundaries between objects. We delve into this issue and propose to learn hierarchical semantics using SAM thereby eliminating the need for extensively querying the language field across various scales and the regularization of DINO features. Extensive experimental results show that LangSplat significantly outperforms the previous state-of-the-art method LERF by a large margin. Notably LangSplat is extremely efficient achieving a 199 x speedup compared to LERF at the resolution of 1440 x 1080.

However these methods exhibit a pervasive enhancement bias towards the compression domain inadvertently regarding it as more realistic than the raw domain. This bias makes enhanced images closely resemble their compressed counterparts thus degrading their perceptual quality. In this paper we propose a simple yet effective method to mitigate this bias and enhance the quality of compressed images. Our method employs a conditional discriminator with the compressed image as a key condition and then incorporates a domain-divergence regularization to actively distance the enhancement domain from the compression domain. Through this dual strategy our method enables the discrimination against the compression domain and brings the enhancement domain closer to the raw domain. Comprehensive quality evaluations confirm the superiority of our method over other state-of-the-art methods without incurring inference overheads."},

The scoring function employs a learned function that provides a geometric feasibility score and a deterministic procedure to quantify a physical stability score. The key to our approach is a new diffusion procedure that combines the discrete empirical data distribution and a continuous distribution induced by the quality checker.

Most existing methods explore utilizing pre-trained vision-language models in which the key is to adopt the image-level model for pixel-level segmentation task. In this paper we propose a simple encoder-decoder named SED for open-vocabulary semantic segmentation which comprises a hierarchical encoder-based cost map generation and a gradual fusion decoder with category early rejection. The hierarchical encoder-based cost map generation employs hierarchical backbone instead of plain transformer to predict pixel-level image-text cost map. Compared to plain transformer hierarchical backbone better captures local spatial information and has linear computational complexity with respect to input size. Our gradual fusion decoder employs a top-down structure to combine cost map and the feature maps of different backbone levels for segmentation. To accelerate inference speed we introduce a category early rejection scheme in the decoder that rejects many no-existing categories at the early layer of decoder resulting in at most 4.7 times acceleration without accuracy degradation. Experiments are performed on multiple open-vocabulary semantic segmentation datasets which demonstrates the efficacy of our SED method. When using ConvNeXt-B our SED method achieves mIoU score of 31.6% on ADE20K with 150 categories at 82 millisecond (ms) per image on a single A6000.

Firstly compared with existing labelled face datasets a vastly larger magnitude of unlabeled faces exists in the real world. We explore the learning strategy of these unlabeled facial images through self-supervised pretraining to transfer generalized face recognition performance. Moreover motivated by one recent finding that is the face saliency area is critical for face recognition in contrast to utilizing random cropped blocks of images for constructing augmentations in pretraining we utilize patches localized by extracted facial landmarks. This enables our method - namely Landmark-based Facial Self-supervised learning (LAFS) to learn key representation that is more critical for face recognition. We also incorporate two landmark-specific augmentations which introduce more diversity of landmark information to further regularize the learning.

However current PFL methods suffer from inconsistencies in both intra-client and inter-client levels: 1) The intra-client inconsistency stems from the asynchronous update strategy for personalized and shared parameters. In PFL clients update their shared parameters to communicate and learn from others while keeping personalized parts unchanged leading to poor coordination between these two components. 2) The Inter-client inconsistency arises from \"stragglers\" - inactive clients that communicate and train with the server less frequently. This results in their under-trained personalized models and impedes the collaborative training stage for other clients. In this paper we present a novel PFL framework named FedAS which uses Federated Parameter-Alignment and Client-Synchronization to overcome above challenges. Initially we enhance the localization of global parameters by infusing them with local insights. We make the shared parts learn from previous model thereby increasing their local relevance and reducing the impact of parameter inconsistency. Furthermore we design a robust aggregation method to mitigate the impact of stragglers by preventing the incorporation of their under-trained knowledge into aggregated model. Experimental results on Cifar10 and Cifar100 validate the effectiveness of our FedAS in achieving better performance and robustness against data heterogeneity."},

However they either discard the distribution information or omit instance-level diversity which are crucial fine-grained clues for LReID. To address the above problems we propose Distribution-aware Knowledge Prototyping (DKP) where the instance-level diversity of each sample is modeled to transfer comprehensive fine-grained knowledge for prototyping and facilitating LReID learning. Specifically an Instance-level Distribution Modeling network is proposed to capture the local diversity of each instance. Then the Distribution-oriented Prototype Generation algorithm transforms the instance-level diversity into identity-level distributions as prototypes which is further explored by the designed Prototype-based Knowledge Transfer module to enhance the knowledge anti-forgetting and acquisition capacity of the LReID model. Extensive experiments verify that our method achieves superior plasticity and stability balancing and outperforms existing LReID methods by 8.1%/9.1% average mAP/R@1 improvement.

Metaxas, Manmohan Chandraker, Samuel Schulter", "abstract": "The recent progress in language-based open-vocabulary object detection can be largely attributed to finding better ways of leveraging large-scale data with free-form text annotations. Training such models with a discriminative objective function has proven successful but requires good positive and negative samples. However the free-form nature and the open vocabulary of object descriptions make the space of negatives extremely large. Prior works randomly sample negatives or use rule-based techniques to build them. In contrast we propose to leverage the vast knowledge built into modern generative models to automatically build negatives that are more relevant to the original data. Specifically we use large-language-models to generate negative text descriptions and text-to-image diffusion models to also generate corresponding negative images. Our experimental analysis confirms the relevance of the generated negative data and its use in language-based detectors improves performance on two complex benchmarks.

Unlike end-to-end shape completion methods based on point clouds or voxels our approach relies on a mesh-based generative network that is easy to optimize enabling it to handle shape completion for irregular facial scans. We first train a shape generator on a mixed 3D facial dataset containing 2405 identities. Based on the incomplete facial input we fit complete faces using an optimization approach under image inpainting guidance. The completion results are refined through a post-processing step. FaceCom demonstrates the ability to effectively and naturally complete facial scan data with varying missing regions and degrees of missing areas. Our method can be used in medical prosthetic fabrication and the registration of deficient scanning data. Our experimental results demonstrate that FaceCom achieves exceptional performance in fitting and shape completion tasks."},

Striking a balance between retaining the generalizable representation capacity of the pre-trained model and acquiring task-specific features poses a key challenge. Currently there is a lack of focus on guiding this delicate trade-off. In this study we approach the problem from the perspective of Singular Value Decomposition (SVD) of pre-trained parameter matrices providing insights into the tuning dynamics of existing methods. Building upon this understanding we propose a Residual-based Low-Rank Rescaling (RLRR) fine-tuning strategy. This strategy not only enhances flexibility in parameter tuning but also ensures that new parameters do not deviate excessively from the pre-trained model through a residual design. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our method achieves competitive performance across various downstream image classification tasks all while maintaining comparable new parameters. We believe this work takes a step forward in offering a unified perspective for interpreting existing methods and serves as motivation for the development of new approaches that move closer to effectively considering the crucial trade-off mentioned above.

Previous modular methods have shown promise with a single planning stage ungrounded in visual content. However through a simple and effective baseline we find that such systems can lead to brittle behavior in practice for challenging videoQA settings. Thus unlike traditional single-stage planning methods we propose a multi-stage system consisting of an event parser a grounding stage and a final reasoning stage in conjunction with an external memory. All stages are training-free and performed using few-shot prompting of large models creating interpretable intermediate outputs at each stage. By decomposing the underlying planning and task complexity our method MoReVQA improves over prior work on standard videoQA benchmarks (NExT-QA iVQA EgoSchema and ActivityNet-QA) with state-of-the-art results and extensions to related tasks (grounded videoQA paragraph captioning)."},

Black", "abstract": "We address the problem of regressing 3D human pose and shape from a single image with a focus on 3D accuracy. The current best methods leverage large datasets of 3D pseudo-ground-truth (p-GT) and 2D keypoints leading to robust performance. With such methods however we observe a paradoxical decline in 3D pose accuracy with increasing 2D accuracy. This is caused by biases in the p-GT and the use of an approximate camera projection model. We quantify the error induced by current camera models and show that fitting 2D keypoints and p-GT accurately causes incorrect 3D poses. Our analysis defines the invalid distances within which minimizing 2D and p-GT losses is detrimental. We use this to formulate a new loss \"Threshold-Adaptive Loss Scaling\" (TALS) that penalizes gross 2D and p-GT errors but not smaller ones. With such a loss there are many 3D poses that could equally explain the 2D evidence. To reduce this ambiguity we need a prior over valid human poses but such priors can introduce unwanted bias. To address this we exploit a tokenized representation of human pose and reformulate the problem as token prediction. This restricts the estimated poses to the space of valid poses effectively improving robustness to occlusion. Extensive experiments on the EMDB and 3DPW datasets show that our reformulated loss and tokenization allows us to train on in-the-wild data while improving 3D accuracy over the state-of-the-art.

To alleviate this recently cross-domain few-shot segmentation (CD-FSS) has emerged. Works that address this task mainly attempted to learn segmentation on a source domain in a manner that generalizes across domains. Surprisingly we can outperform these approaches while eliminating the training stage and removing their main segmentation network. We show test-time task-adaption is the key for successful CD-FSS instead. Task-adaption is achieved by appending small networks to the feature pyramid of a conventionally classification-pretrained backbone. To avoid overfitting to the few labeled samples in supervised fine-tuning consistency across augmented views of input images serves as guidance while learning the parameters of the attached layers. Despite our self-restriction not to use any images other than the few labeled samples at test time we achieve new state-of-the-art performance in CD-FSS evidencing the need to rethink approaches for the task.

Typically redundant weights or structures are removed to achieve the target resource budget. Although data-driven pruning approaches have proven to be more effective they cannot be directly applied to federated learning (FL) which has emerged as a popular technique in edge computing applications because of distributed and confidential datasets. In response to this challenge we design a new network pruning method for FL. We propose device-wise sub-networks for each device assuming that the data distribution is similar within each device. These sub-networks are generated through sub-network embeddings and a hypernetwork. To further minimize memory usage and communication costs we permanently prune the full model to remove weights that are not useful for all devices. During the FL process we simultaneously train the device-wise sub-networks and the base sub-network to facilitate the pruning process. We then finetune the pruned model with device-wise sub-networks to regain performance. Moreover we provided the theoretical guarantee of convergence for our method. Our method achieves better performance and resource trade-off than other well-established network pruning baselines as demonstrated through extensive experiments on CIFAR-10 CIFAR-100 and TinyImageNet."},

C3Net adapts the ControlNet architecture to jointly train and make inferences on a production-ready diffusion model and its trainable copies. Specifically C3Net first aligns the conditions from multi-modalities to the same semantic latent space using modality-specific encoders based on contrastive training. Then it generates multimodal outputs based on the aligned latent space whose semantic information is combined using a ControlNet-like architecture called Control C3-UNet. Correspondingly with this system design our model offers an improved solution for joint-modality generation through learning and explaining multimodal conditions involving more than just linear interpolation within the latent space. Meanwhile as we align conditions to a unified latent space C3Net only requires one trainable Control C3-UNet to work on multimodal semantic information. Furthermore our model employs unimodal pretraining on the condition alignment stage outperforming the non-pretrained alignment even on relatively scarce training data and thus demonstrating high-quality compound condition generation. We contribute the first high-quality tri-modal validation set to validate quantitatively that C3Net outperforms or is on par with the first and contemporary state-of-the-art multimodal generation.

{"title": "Mitigating Motion Blur in Neural Radiance Fields with Events and Frames", "authors": "Marco Cannici, Davide Scaramuzza", "abstract": "Neural Radiance Fields (NeRFs) have shown great potential in novel view synthesis. However they struggle to render sharp images when the data used for training is affected by motion blur. On the other hand event cameras excel in dynamic scenes as they measure brightness changes with microsecond resolution and are thus only marginally affected by blur. Recent methods attempt to enhance NeRF reconstructions under camera motion by fusing frames and events. However they face challenges in recovering accurate color content or constrain the NeRF to a set of predefined camera poses harming reconstruction quality in challenging conditions. This paper proposes a novel formulation addressing these issues by leveraging both model- and learning-based modules. We explicitly model the blur formation process exploiting the event double integral as an additional model-based prior. Additionally we model the event-pixel response using an end-to-end learnable response function allowing our method to adapt to non-idealities in the real event-camera sensor. We show on synthetic and real data that the proposed approach outperforms existing deblur NeRFs that use only frames as well as those that combine frames and events by +6.13dB and +2.48dB respectively."},

Consequently the lack of task-specific design will inevitably lead to limitations in associating the intrinsic specialty of two tasks. To tackle the issue we propose a Unified Video COMprehension framework (UVCOM) to bridge the gap and jointly solve MR and HD effectively. By performing progressive integration on intra and inter-modality across multi-granularity UVCOM achieves the comprehensive understanding in processing a video. Moreover we present multi-aspect contrastive learning to consolidate the local relation modeling and global knowledge accumulation via well aligned multi-modal space.

We show that prior approaches which are category-specific fail to generalize to rare species with limited training images. We address this challenge by introducing the Semantic Bank of Skinned Models (SBSM) which automatically discovers a small set of base animal shapes by combining geometric inductive priors with semantic knowledge implicitly captured by an off-the-shelf self-supervised feature extractor. To train such a model we also contribute a new large-scale dataset of diverse animal species.

To address this issue we propose the sparsity-adaptive depth refinement (SDR) framework which refines monocular depth estimates using sparse depth points. For SDR we propose the masked spatial propagation network (MSPN) to perform SDR with a varying number of sparse depths effectively by gradually propagating sparse depth information throughout the entire depth map. Experimental results demonstrate that MPSN achieves state-of-the-art performance on both SDR and conventional depth completion scenarios."},

In this work we propose a novel Primal policy Optimization with Conservative Estimation algorithm (POCE) to address the problem of multi-constraint offline RL. Concretely we reframe the objective of multi-constraint offline RL by introducing the concept of Maximum Markov Decision Processes (MMDP). Subsequently we present a primal policy optimization algorithm to confront the multi-constraint problems which improves the stability and convergence speed of model training. Furthermore we propose a conditional Bellman operator to estimate cumulative and state-wise Q-values reducing the extrapolation error caused by out-of-distribution (OOD) actions.

This framework facilitates temporal interpolation without the need for any intermediate frames distinguishing it from the majority of other existing unsupervised methods. Experiments on benchmark datasets demonstrate significant improvements across diverse evaluation metrics compared to unsupervised and supervised baselines. Remarkably our approach achieves this superior performance even when trained with a dataset as small as one highlighting its exceptional robustness and efficiency in scenarios with sparse supervision.

Essentially GCD needs to remember existing patterns thoroughly to recognize novel categories. Recent state-of-the-art method SimGCD transfers the knowledge from known-class data to the learning of novel classes through debiased learning. However some patterns are catastrophically forgot during adaptation and thus lead to poor performance in novel categories classification. To address this issue we propose a novel learning approach LegoGCD which is seamlessly integrated into previous methods to enhance the discrimination of novel classes while maintaining performance on previously encountered known classes. Specifically we design two types of techniques termed as \\underline L ocal \\underline E ntropy Re\\underline g ularization (LER) and Dual-views Kullback-Leibler divergence c\\underline o nstraint (DKL).

In this way it successfully avoids mismatched prediction and generates more reliable potential known class samples simultaneously.

We propose Group Anything with Radiance Fields (GARField) an approach for decomposing 3D scenes into a hierarchy of semantically meaningful groups from posed image inputs. To do this we embrace group ambiguity through physical scale: by optimizing a scale-conditioned 3D affinity feature field a point in the world can belong to different groups of different sizes. We optimize this field from a set of 2D masks provided by Segment Anything (SAM) in a way that respects coarse-to-fine hierarchy using scale to consistently fuse conflicting masks from different viewpoints. From this field we can derive a hierarchy of possible groupings via automatic tree construction or user interaction. We evaluate GARField on a variety of in-the-wild scenes and find it effectively extracts groups at many levels: clusters of objects objects and various subparts. GARField inherently represents multi-view consistent groupings and produces higher fidelity groups than the input SAM masks. GARField's hierarchical grouping could have exciting downstream applications such as 3D asset extraction or dynamic scene understanding. Project site: https://www.garfield.studio/"},

This is essentially a multi-label classification task since a question may have multiple answers. However due to annotation costs the labels in existing benchmarks are always extremely insufficient typically one answer per question. As a result existing works tend to directly treat all the unlabeled answers as negative labels leading to limited ability for generalization. In this work we introduce a simple yet effective ranking distillation framework (RADI) to mitigate this problem without additional manual annotation. RADI employs a teacher model trained with incomplete labels to generate rankings for potential answers which contain rich knowledge about label priority as well as label-associated visual cues thereby enriching the insufficient labeling information. To avoid overconfidence in the imperfect teacher model we further present two robust and parameter-free ranking distillation approaches: a pairwise approach which introduces adaptive soft margins to dynamically refine the optimization constraints on various pairwise rankings and a listwise approach which adopts sampling-based partial listwise learning to resist the bias in teacher ranking. Extensive experiments on five popular benchmarks consistently show that both our pairwise and listwise RADIs outperform state-of-the-art methods.

It runs offline in three steps: i) it retrieves relevant super-/sub-categories from a hierarchy for each target class; ii) it integrates these categories into hierarchy-aware sentences; iii) it fuses these sentence embeddings to generate the nexus classifier vector. Our evaluation on various detection benchmarks demonstrates that SHiNe enhances robustness across diverse vocabulary granularities achieving up to +31.9% mAP50 with ground truth hierarchies while retaining improvements using hierarchies generated by large language models. Moreover when applied to open-vocabulary classification on ImageNet-1k SHiNe improves the CLIP zero-shot baseline by +2.8% accuracy. SHiNe is training-free and can be seamlessly integrated with any off-the-shelf OvOD detector without incurring additional computational overhead during inference. The code is open source."},

Nevertheless their spherical nature gives rise to various and uncertain user viewing behaviors which poses significant challenges for panoramic video quality assessment (PVQA). In this work we propose an end-to-end optimized blind PVQA method with explicit modeling of user viewing patterns through visual scanpaths. Our method consists of two modules: a scanpath generator and a quality assessor. The scanpath generator is initially trained to predict future scanpaths by minimizing their expected code length and then jointly optimized with the quality assessor for quality prediction. Our blind PVQA method enables direct quality assessment of panoramic images by treating them as videos composed of identical frames. Experiments on three public panoramic image and video quality datasets encompassing both synthetic and authentic distortions validate the superiority of our blind PVQA model over existing methods."},

However NeRF training requires accurate camera pose for each input view typically obtained by Structure-from-Motion (SfM) pipelines. Recent works have attempted to relax this constraint but they still often rely on decent initial poses which they can refine. Here we aim at removing the requirement for pose initialization. We present Incremental CONfidence (ICON) an optimization procedure for training NeRFs from 2D video frames. ICON only assumes smooth camera motion to estimate initial guess for poses. Further ICON introduces \"confidence\": an adaptive measure of model quality used to dynamically reweight gradients. ICON relies on high-confidence poses to learn NeRF and high-confidence 3D structure (as encoded by NeRF) to learn poses. We show that ICON without prior pose initialization achieves superior performance in both CO3D and HO3D versus methods which use SfM pose."},

We train our architecture following a simple self-supervised training scheme in which input displacements over a set of sparse control vertices are used to overwrite the encoded geometry in order to transform one training sample into another. During inference our model produces a dense output that adheres locally to the specified sparse geometry while maintaining the overall appearance of the encoded object. This approach results in state-of-the-art performance in both disentangling manipulated geometry and 3D mesh reconstruction. To the best of our knowledge LAMM is the first end-to-end framework that enables direct local control of 3D vertex geometry in a single forward pass. A very efficient computational graph allows our network to train with only a fraction of the memory required by previous methods and run faster during inference generating 12k vertex meshes at >60fps on a single CPU thread.

To address these issues researchers have proposed availability attacks that aim to render data unexploitable. However many availability attack methods can be easily disrupted by adversarial training. Although some robust methods can resist adversarial training their protective effects are limited. In this paper we re-examine the existing availability attack methods and propose a novel two-stage min-max-min optimization paradigm to generate robust unlearnable noise. The inner min stage is utilized to generate unlearnable noise while the outer min-max stage simulates the training process of the poisoned model. Additionally we formulate the attack effects and use it to constrain the optimization objective. Comprehensive experiments have revealed that the noise generated by our method can lead to a decline in test accuracy for adversarially trained poisoned models by up to approximately 30% in comparison to SOTA methods."},

This method can automatically tune the parameter based on a given error bound to guarantee accuracy. The Hadamard-Equipped Sinkhorn formulas introduced in this study significantly enhance the efficiency and stability of the adaptive softassign.

To alleviate the annotation burden contrastive learning has attracted increasing attention for tackling semi-supervised 3D semantic segmentation. However existing point-to-point contrastive learning techniques in literature are generally sensitive to outliers resulting in insufficient modeling of the point-wise representations. To address this problem we propose a method named DDSemi for semi-supervised 3D semantic segmentation where a density-guided contrastive learning technique is explored. This technique calculates the contrastive loss in a point-to-anchor manner by estimating an anchor for each class from the memory bank based on the finding that the cluster centers tend to be located in dense regions. In this technique an inter-contrast loss is derived from the perturbed unlabeled point cloud pairs while an intra-contrast loss is derived from a single unlabeled point cloud. The derived losses could enhance the discriminability of the features and implicitly constrain the semantic consistency between the perturbed unlabeled point cloud pairs. In addition we propose a dual-space hardness sampling strategy to pay more attention to the hard samples located in sparse regions of both the geometric space and feature space by reweighting the point-wise intra-contrast loss. Experimental results on both indoor-scene and outdoor-scene datasets demonstrate that the proposed method outperforms the comparative state-of-the-art semi-supervised methods."},

To reduce costs in practice low-cost multi-view cameras for 3D object detection are proposed to replace the expansive LiDAR sensors. However relying solely on cameras is difficult to achieve highly accurate and robust 3D object detection. An effective solution to this issue is combining multi-view cameras with the economical millimeter-wave radar sensor to achieve more reliable multi-modal 3D object detection. In this paper we introduce RCBEVDet a radar-camera fusion 3D object detection method in the bird's eye view (BEV). Specifically we first design RadarBEVNet for radar BEV feature extraction. RadarBEVNet consists of a dual-stream radar backbone and a Radar Cross-Section (RCS) aware BEV encoder. In the dual-stream radar backbone a point-based encoder and a transformer-based encoder are proposed to extract radar features with an injection and extraction module to facilitate communication between the two encoders. The RCS-aware BEV encoder takes RCS as the object size prior to scattering the point feature in BEV. Besides we present the Cross-Attention Multi-layer Fusion module to automatically align the multi-modal BEV feature from radar and camera with the deformable attention mechanism and then fuse the feature with channel and spatial fusion layers. Experimental results show that RCBEVDet achieves new state-of-the-art radar-camera fusion results on nuScenes and view-of-delft (VoD) 3D object detection benchmarks. Furthermore RCBEVDet achieves better 3D detection results than all real-time camera-only and radar-camera 3D object detectors with a faster inference speed at 21 28 FPS.

However the 3D content generated by existing methods often exhibits distorted outline shapes and inadequate details. To solve this problem we propose a novel framework called Mask-enhanced Progressive Outline-to-Detail optimization (aka. MPOD123) which consists of two stages. Specifically in the first stage MPOD123 utilizes the pretrained view-conditioned diffusion model to guide the outline shape optimization of the 3D content. Given certain viewpoint we estimate outline shape priors in the form of 2D mask from the 3D content by leveraging opacity calculation. In the second stage MPOD123 incorporates Detail Appearance Inpainting (DAI) to guide the refinement on local geometry and texture with the shape priors. The essence of DAI lies in the Mask Rectified Cross-Attention (MRCA) which can be conveniently plugged in the stable diffusion model. The MRCA module utilizes the mask to rectify the attention map from each cross-attention layer. Accompanied with this new module DAI is capable of guiding the detail refinement of the 3D content while better preserves the outline shape. To assess the applicability in practical scenarios we contribute a new dataset modeled on real-world e-commerce environments. Extensive quantitative and qualitative experiments on this dataset and open benchmarks demonstrate the effectiveness of MPOD123 over the state-of-the-arts."},

Yet one pain point persists: the text prompt engineering and searching high-quality text prompts for customized results is more art than science. Moreover as commonly argued: \"an image is worth a thousand words\" - the attempt to describe a desired image with texts often ends up being ambiguous and cannot comprehensively cover delicate visual details hence necessitating more additional controls from the visual domain. In this paper we take a bold step forward: taking \"Text\" out of a pretrained T2I diffusion model to reduce the burdensome prompt engineering efforts for users. Our proposed framework Prompt-Free Diffusion relies on only visual inputs to generate new images: it takes a reference image as \"context\" an optional image structural conditioning and an initial noise with absolutely no text prompt. The core architecture behind the scene is Semantic Context Encoder (SeeCoder) substituting the commonly used CLIP-based or LLM-based text encoder. The reusability of SeeCoder also makes it a convenient drop-in component: one can also pre-train a SeeCoder in one T2I model and reuse it for another. Through extensive experiments Prompt-Free Diffusion is experimentally found to (i) outperform prior exemplar-based image synthesis approaches; (ii) perform on par with state-of-the-art T2I models using prompts following the best practice; and (iii) be naturally extensible to other downstream applications such as anime figure generation and virtual try-on with promising quality.

However these datasets revisit the same geographic locations across training validation and test sets. Specifically over 80% of nuScenes and 40% of Argoverse 2 validation and test samples are less than 5 m from a training sample. At test time the methods are thus evaluated more on how well they localize within a memorized implicit map built from the training data than on extrapolating to unseen locations. Naturally this data leakage causes inflated performance numbers and we propose geographically disjoint data splits to reveal the true performance in unseen environments. Experimental results show that methods perform considerably worse some dropping more than 45 mAP when trained and evaluated on proper data splits. Additionally a reassessment of prior design choices reveals diverging conclusions from those based on the original split.

They are effective in small-scale scenes but face significant challenges in large-scale scenes that are further amplified in the absence of ground truth 3D point clouds for supervision. Here the model can only rely on reprojection constraints and needs to implicitly triangulate the points. The challenges stem from a fundamental dilemma: The network has to be invariant to observations of the same landmark at different viewpoints and lighting conditions etc. but at the same time discriminate unrelated but similar observations. The latter becomes more relevant and severe in larger scenes. In this work we tackle this problem by introducing the concept of co-visibility to the network. We propose GLACE which integrates pre-trained global and local encodings and enables SCR to scale to large scenes with only a single small-sized network. Specifically we propose a novel feature diffusion technique that implicitly groups the reprojection constraints with co-visibility and avoids overfitting to trivial solutions.

In practice NViST exploits fine-tuned masked autoencoder (MAE) features and translates them to 3D output tokens via cross-attention while addressing occlusions with self-attention. To move away from object-centred datasets and enable full scene synthesis NViST adopts a 6-DOF camera pose model and only requires relative pose dropping the need for canonicalization of the training data which removes a substantial barrier to it being used on casually captured datasets. We show results on unseen objects and categories from MVImgNet and even generalization to casual phone captures. We conduct qualitative and quantitative evaluations on MVImgNet and ShapeNet to show that our model represents a step forward towards enabling true in-the-wild generalizable novel-view synthesis from a single image.

Conjointly test-time augmentation which utilizes multiple augmented views of a single image to enhance zero-shot generalization is emerging as a significant area of interest. This has predominantly directed research efforts towards test-time prompt tuning. In contrast we introduce a robust MeanShift for Test-time Augmentation (MTA) which surpasses prompt-based methods without requiring this intensive training procedure. This positions MTA as an ideal solution for both standalone and API-based applications. Additionally our method does not rely on ad hoc rules (e.g. confidence threshold) used in some previous test-time augmentation techniques to filter the augmented views. Instead MTA incorporates a quality assessment variable for each view directly into its optimization process termed as the inlierness score. This score is jointly optimized with a density mode seeking process leading to an efficient training- and hyperparameter-free approach. We extensively benchmark our method on 15 datasets and demonstrate MTA's superiority and computational efficiency. Deployed easily as plug-and-play module on top of zero-shot models and state-of-the-art few-shot methods MTA shows systematic and consistent improvements."},

While recent advancements have introduced control over factors such as object localization posture and image contours a crucial gap remains in our ability to control the interactions between objects in the generated content. Well-controlling interactions in generated images could yield meaningful applications such as creating realistic scenes with interacting characters. In this work we study the problems of conditioning T2I diffusion models with Human-Object Interaction (HOI) information consisting of a triplet label (person action object) and corresponding bounding boxes. We propose a pluggable interaction control model called InteractDiffusion that extends existing pre-trained T2I diffusion models to enable them being better conditioned on interactions. Specifically we tokenize the HOI information and learn their relationships via interaction embeddings. A conditioning self-attention layer is trained to map HOI tokens to visual tokens thereby conditioning the visual tokens better in existing T2I diffusion models. Our model attains the ability to control the interaction and location on existing T2I diffusion models which outperforms existing baselines by a large margin in HOI detection score as well as fidelity in FID and KID.

However since not every possible attack type is available in the training stage these FAS methods usually fail to detect unseen attacks in the inference stage. In comparison one-class FAS where the training data are from only live faces aims to detect whether a test face image belongs to the live class or not. In this paper we propose a novel One-Class Spoof Cue Map estimation Network (OC-SCMNet) to address the one-class FAS detection problem. Our first goal is to learn to extract latent spoof features from live images so that their estimated Spoof Cue Maps (SCMs) should have zero responses. To avoid trapping to a trivial solution we devise a novel SCM-guided feature learning by combining many SCMs as pseudo ground-truths to guide a conditional generator to generate latent spoof features for spoof data. Our second goal is to approximately simulate the potential out-of-distribution spoof attacks. To this end we propose using a memory bank to dynamically preserve a set of sufficiently \"independent\" latent spoof features to encourage the generator to probe the latent spoof feature space. Extensive experiments conducted on eight FAS benchmark datasets demonstrate that the proposed OC-SCMNet not only outperforms previous one-class FAS methods but also achieves comparable performances to state-of-the-art two-class FAS method.

Given a single image our trained model uses a frequency-coordinated diffusion sampling process to predict a spectral volume which can be converted into a motion texture that spans an entire video.

They quickly overwhelmed sparse CNNs and became state-of-the-art models especially in 3D semantic segmentation. However sparse CNNs are still valuable networks due to their efficiency treasure and ease of application. In this work we reexamine the design distinctions and test the limits of what a sparse CNN can achieve. We discover that the key credit to the performance difference is adaptivity. Specifically we propose two key components i.e. adaptive receptive fields (spatially) and adaptive relation to bridge the gap. This exploration led to the creation of Omni-Adaptive 3D CNNs (OA-CNNs) a family of networks that integrates a lightweight module to greatly enhance the adaptivity of sparse CNNs at minimal computational cost. Without any self-attention modules OA-CNNs favorably surpass point transformers in terms of accuracy in both indoor and outdoor scenes with much less latency and memory cost. Notably it achieves 76.1% 78.9% and 70.6% mIoU on ScanNet v2 nuScenes and SemanticKITTI validation benchmarks respectively while maintaining at most 5x better speed than transformer counterparts.

Dominant pipelines propose to tackle the visual discrepancies with additional temporal learners while overlooking the substantial discrepancy for web-scaled descriptive narratives and concise action category names leading to less distinct semantic space and potential performance limitations. In this work we prioritize the refinement of text knowledge to facilitate generalizable video recognition. To address the limitations of the less distinct semantic space of category names we prompt a large language model (LLM) to augment action class names into Spatio-Temporal Descriptors thus bridging the textual discrepancy and serving as a knowledge base for general recognition. Moreover to assign the best descriptors with different video instances we propose Optimal Descriptor Solver forming the video recognition problem as solving the optimal matching flow across frame-level representations and descriptors. Comprehensive evaluations in zero-shot few-shot and fully supervised video recognition highlight the effectiveness of our approach. Our best model achieves a state-of-the-art zero-shot accuracy of 75.1% on Kinetics-600."},

These architectures typically comprise a vision encoder a Large Language Model (LLM) and a projection module that aligns visual features with the LLM's representation space. Despite their success a critical limitation persists: the vision encoding process remains decoupled from user queries often in the form of image-related questions. Consequently the resulting visual features may not be optimally attuned to the query-specific elements of the image. To address this we introduce QA-ViT a Question Aware Vision Transformer approach for multimodal reasoning which embeds question awareness directly within the vision encoder. This integration results in dynamic visual features focusing on relevant image aspects to the posed question. QA-ViT is model-agnostic and can be incorporated efficiently into any VL architecture.

Our model comprises a base quality predictor a spatial rectifier and a temporal rectifier responding to the visual content and distortion spatial resolution and frame rate changes on video quality respectively. During training spatial and temporal rectifiers are dropped out with some probabilities to render the base quality predictor a standalone BVQA model which should work better with the rectifiers.

However common distance field based implicit representations specifically signed distance field (SDF) for watertight shapes or unsigned distance field (UDF) for arbitrary shapes routinely suffer from degradation of reconstruction accuracy when converting to explicit surface points and meshes. In this paper we introduce a novel neural implicit representation based on unsigned orthogonal distance fields (UODFs). In UODFs the minimal unsigned distance from any spatial point to the shape surface is defined solely in one orthogonal direction contrasting with the multi-directional determination made by SDF and UDF. Consequently every point in the 3D UODFs can directly access its closest surface points along three orthogonal directions. This distinctive feature leverages the accurate reconstruction of surface points without interpolation errors. We verify the effectiveness of UODFs through a range of reconstruction examples extending from simple watertight or non-watertight shapes to complex shapes that include hollows internal or assembling structures."},

In this work we tackle the task of reconstructing closely interactive humans from a monocular video. The main challenge of this task comes from insufficient visual information caused by depth ambiguity and severe inter-person occlusion. In view of this we propose to leverage knowledge from proxemic behavior and physics to compensate the lack of visual information. This is based on the observation that human interaction has specific patterns following the social proxemics. Specifically we first design a latent representation based on Vector Quantised-Variational AutoEncoder (VQ-VAE) to model human interaction. A proxemics and physics guided diffusion model is then introduced to denoise the initial distribution. We design the diffusion model as dual branch with each branch representing one individual such that the interaction can be modeled via cross attention. With the learned priors of VQ-VAE and physical constraint as the additional information our proposed approach is capable of estimating accurate poses that are also proxemics and physics plausible.

However the accuracy and robustness resulting from the adversarial training are limited by the architecture because adversarial training improves accuracy and robustness by adjusting the weight connection affiliated to the architecture. In this work we propose ARNAS to search for accurate and robust architectures for adversarial training. First we design an accurate and robust search space in which the placement of the cells and the proportional relationship of the filter numbers are carefully determined. With the design the architectures can obtain both accuracy and robustness by deploying accurate and robust structures to their sensitive positions respectively. Then we propose a differentiable multi-objective search strategy performing gradient descent towards directions that are beneficial for both natural loss and adversarial loss thus the accuracy and robustness can be guaranteed at the same time. We conduct comprehensive experiments in terms of white-box attacks black-box attacks and transferability. Experimental results show that the searched architecture has the strongest robustness with the competitive accuracy and breaks the traditional idea that NAS-based architectures cannot transfer well to complex tasks in robustness scenarios.

This dual diffusion framework expands the denoising-based diffusion models initially uninterpretable for image restoration into a unified and interpretable model for both image generation and restoration by introducing residuals. Specifically our residual diffusion represents directional diffusion from the target image to the degraded input image and explicitly guides the reverse generation process for image restoration while noise diffusion represents random perturbations in the diffusion process. The residual prioritizes certainty while the noise emphasizes diversity enabling RDDM to effectively unify tasks with varying certainty or diversity requirements such as image generation and restoration. We demonstrate that our sampling process is consistent with that of DDPM and DDIM through coefficient transformation and propose a partially path-independent generation process to better understand the reverse process.

One of the key reasons is the limited scale of publicly available data (e.g. 10M video-text pairs in WebVid10M vs. 5B image-text pairs in LAION) considering the high cost of video captioning. Instead it could be far easier to collect unlabeled clips from video platforms like YouTube. Motivated by this we come up with a novel text-to-video generation framework termed TF-T2V which can directly learn with text-free videos. The rationale behind is to separate the process of text decoding from that of temporal modeling. To this end we employ a content branch and a motion branch which are jointly optimized with weights shared. Following such a pipeline we study the effect of doubling the scale of training set (i.e. video-only WebVid10M) with some randomly collected text-free videos and are encouraged to observe the performance improvement (FID from 9.67 to 8.19 and FVD from 484 to 441) demonstrating the scalability of our approach.

Existing methods rely on tedious multiple encoder-decoder streams and stages to gradually complete the global localization and local refinement. Human visual system captures regions of interest by observing them from multiple views.

We present a unified method to simultaneously sparsify the viewgraph and remove false edges. We propose a scoring mechanism based on camera triplets that identifies edge redundancy as well as false edges. Our edge selection is formulated as an optimization problem which can be provably solved using a simple thresholding scheme. This results in a highly efficient algorithm which can be incorporated as a pre-processing step into any SfM pipeline making it practically usable. We demonstrate the utility of our method on generic and ambiguous datasets that cover the range of small medium and large-scale datasets all with different statistical properties. Sparsification of generic datasets using our method significantly reduces reconstruction time while maintaining the accuracy of the reconstructions as well as removing ghosting artifacts.

We propose a unified multi-modal framework---Audio-Visual Conversational Attention (AV-CONV) for the joint prediction of conversation behaviors---speaking and listening---for both the camera wearer as well as all other social partners present in the egocentric video. Specifically we adopt the self-attention mechanism to model the representations across-time across-subjects and across-modalities. To validate our method we conduct experiments on a challenging egocentric video dataset that includes multi-speaker and multi-conversation scenarios. Our results demonstrate the superior performance of our method compared to a series of baselines. We also present detailed ablation studies to assess the contribution of each component in our model.

However DFL exhibits heightened susceptibility to Byzantine attacks owing to the lack of a responsible central server. Furthermore a benign client in DFL may be dominated by Byzantine clients (more than half of its neighbors are malicious) posing significant challenges for robust model training. In this work we propose DFL-Dual a novel Byzantine-robust DFL method through dual-domain client clustering and trust bootstrapping. Specifically we first propose to leverage both data-domain and model-domain distance metrics to identify client discrepancies. Then we design a trust evaluation mechanism centered on benign clients which enables them to evaluate their neighbors. Building upon the dual-domain distance metric and trust evaluation mechanism we further develop a two-stage clustering and trust bootstrapping technique to exclude Byzantine clients from local model aggregation. We extensively evaluate the proposed DFL-Dual method through rigorous experimentation demonstrating its remarkable performance superiority over existing robust CFL and DFL schemes."},

While learning-based grasp detection methods can predict grasp poses for unseen objects using the grasp distribution learned from the training set they often exhibit a significant performance drop when encountering objects with diverse shapes and structures. To enhance the grasp detection methods' generalization ability we incorporate domain prior knowledge of robotic grasping enabling better adaptation to objects with significant shape and structure differences. More specifically we employ the physical constraint regularization during the training phase to guide the model towards predicting grasps that comply with the physical rule on grasping. For the unstable grasp poses predicted on novel objects we design a contact-score joint optimization using the projection contact map to refine these poses in cluttered scenarios. Extensive experiments conducted on the GraspNet-1billion benchmark demonstrate a substantial performance gain on the novel object set and the real-world grasping experiments also demonstrate the effectiveness of our generalizing 6-DoF grasp detection method."},

It seeks to distinguish the worked material which is critical for understanding archaeological artifacts material interactions tool functionalities and dental records. However this challenging task goes beyond the well-studied image classification problem for common objects. It is affected by many confounders owing to the complex wear mechanism and microscopic imaging which makes it difficult even for human experts to identify the worked material successfully. In this paper we investigate the following three questions on this unique vision task for the first time:(i) How well can state-of-the-art pre-trained models (like DINOv2) generalize to the rarely seen domain? (ii) How can few-shot learning be exploited for scarce microscopic images? (iii) How do the ambiguous magnification and sensing modality influence the classification accuracy? To study these we collaborated with archaeologists and built the first open-source and the largest LUWA dataset containing 23130 microscopic images with different magnifications and sensing modalities. Extensive experiments show that existing pre-trained models notably outperform human experts but still leave a large gap for improvements. Most importantly the LUWA dataset provides an underexplored opportunity for vision and learning communities and complements existing image classification problems on common objects."},

Recent benchmarks do not address hallucinations in open-ended free-form responses which we term \"Type I hallucinations\". Instead they focus on hallucinations responding to very specific question formats---typically a multiple-choice response regarding a particular object or attribute---which we term \"Type II hallucinations\". Additionally such benchmarks often require external API calls to models which are subject to change. In practice we observe that a reduction in Type II hallucinations does not lead to a reduction in Type I hallucinations but rather that the two forms of hallucinations are often anti-correlated. To address this we propose THRONE a novel object-based automatic framework for quantitatively evaluating Type I hallucinations in LVLM free-form outputs. We use public language models (LMs) to identify hallucinations in LVLM responses and compute informative metrics. By evaluating a large selection of recent LVLMs using public datasets we show that an improvement in existing metrics do not lead to a reduction in Type I hallucinations and that established benchmarks for measuring Type I hallucinations are incomplete. Finally we provide a simple and effective data augmentation method to reduce Type I and Type II hallucinations as a strong baseline."},

Recently Vision-Language Models (VLMs) have demonstrated remarkable performance in WSI classification. However existing methods leverage coarse-grained pathogenetic descriptions for visual representation supervision which are insufficient to capture the complex visual appearance of pathogenetic images hindering the generalizability of models on diverse downstream tasks. Additionally processing high-resolution WSIs can be computationally expensive. In this paper we propose a novel \"Fine-grained Visual-Semantic Interaction\" (FiVE) framework for WSI classification. It is designed to enhance the model's generalizability by leveraging the interaction between localized visual patterns and fine-grained pathological semantics. Specifically with meticulously designed queries we start by utilizing a large language model to extract fine-grained pathological descriptions from various non-standardized raw reports. The output descriptions are then reconstructed into fine-grained labels used for training. By introducing a Task-specific Fine-grained Semantics (TFS) module we enable prompts to capture crucial visual information in WSIs which enhances representation learning and augments generalization capabilities significantly. Furthermore given that pathological visual patterns are redundantly distributed across tissue slices we sample a subset of visual instances during training. Our method demonstrates robust generalizability and strong transferability dominantly outperforming the counterparts on the TCGA Lung Cancer dataset with at least 9.19% higher accuracy in few-shot experiments.

In this paper we present Text Grouping Adapter (TGA) a module that can enable the utilization of various pre-trained text detectors to learn layout analysis allowing us to adopt a well-trained text detector right off the shelf or just fine-tune it efficiently. Designed to be compatible with various text detector architectures TGA takes detected text regions and image features as universal inputs to assemble text instance features. To capture broader contextual information for layout analysis we propose to predict text group masks from text instance features by one-to-many assignment.

However most AT methods suffer from robust overfitting i.e. a significant generalization gap in adversarial robustness between the training and testing curves. In this paper we first identify a connection between robust overfitting and the excessive memorization of noisy labels in AT from a view of gradient norm. As such label noise is mainly caused by a distribution mismatch and improper label assignments we are motivated to propose a label refinement approach for AT. Specifically our Self-Guided Label Refinement first self-refines a more accurate and informative label distribution from over-confident hard labels and then it calibrates the training by dynamically incorporating knowledge from self-distilled models into the current model and thus requiring no external teachers. Empirical results demonstrate that our method can simultaneously boost the standard accuracy and robust performance across multiple benchmark datasets attack types and architectures. In addition we also provide a set of analyses from the perspectives of information theory to dive into our method and suggest the importance of soft labels for robust generalization."},

Such paths capture rich information about the decision boundary.

Recognizing the diverse impacts of intermediate adversarial samples (ranging from benign to noisy) we propose an adaptive weighting strategy to selectively emphasize informative adversarial samples thus ensuring efficient utilization of lightweight model capacity. Moreover we propose a dual-branch mechanism exploiting two following insights: (i) complementary dynamics of adversarial paths obtained by targeted and untargeted adversarial learning and (ii) inherent differences between the gradient ascent path from class c_i towards the nearest class boundary and the gradient descent path from a specific class c_j towards the decision region of c_i (i \\neq j).

These are usually tedious and cumbersome to obtain yet they are mandatory to triangulate corresponding pixels in 3D space which is at the core of all best performing MVS algorithms. In this work we take an opposite stance and introduce DUSt3R a radically novel paradigm for Dense and Unconstrained Stereo 3D Reconstruction of arbitrary image collections operating without prior information about camera calibration nor viewpoint poses. We cast the pairwise reconstruction problem as a regression of pointmaps relaxing the hard constraints of usual projective camera models. We show that this formulation smoothly unifies the monocular and binocular reconstruction cases. In the case where more than two images are provided we further propose a simple yet effective global alignment strategy that expresses all pairwise pointmaps in a common reference frame. We base our network architecture on standard Transformer encoders and decoders allowing us to leverage powerful pretrained models. Our formulation directly provides a 3D model of the scene as well as depth information but interestingly we can seamlessly recover from it pixel matches focal lengths relative and absolute cameras. Extensive experiments on all these tasks showcase how DUSt3R effectively unifies various 3D vision tasks setting new performance records on monocular & multi-view depth estimation as well as relative pose estimation.

Traditional semi-supervised segmentation and unsupervised domain adaptation methods address one of these issues separately. However the coexistence of limited annotation and domain shift is quite common which motivates us to introduce a novel and challenging scenario: Mixed Domain Semi-supervised medical image Segmentation (MiDSS). In this scenario we handle data from multiple medical centers with limited annotations available for a single domain and a large amount of unlabeled data from multiple domains. We found that the key to solving the problem lies in how to generate reliable pseudo labels for the unlabeled data in the presence of domain shift with labeled data. To tackle this issue we employ Unified Copy-Paste (UCP) between images to construct intermediate domains facilitating the knowledge transfer from the domain of labeled data to the domains of unlabeled data. To fully utilize the information within the intermediate domain we propose a symmetric Guidance training strategy (SymGD) which additionally offers direct guidance to unlabeled data by merging pseudo labels from intermediate samples.

In this paper we propose a novel method for increasing the parameter efficiency of pre-trained models by introducing an intermediate pre-training stage. To this end we first employ low-rank approximation to compress the original large model and then devise a feature distillation module and a weight perturbation regularization module. These modules are specifically designed to enhance the low-rank model. In particular we update only the low-rank model while freezing the backbone parameters during pre-training. This allows for direct and efficient utilization of the low-rank model for downstream fine-tuning tasks. The proposed method achieves both efficiencies in terms of required parameters and computation time while maintaining comparable results with minimal modifications to the backbone architecture.

Image super-resolution (SR) is one of the promising solutions for addressing the challenges.

Therefore in this paper we propose Super-Resolution for Image Recognition (SR4IR) that effectively guides the generation of SR images beneficial to achieving satisfactory image recognition performance when processing LR images. The critical component of our SR4IR is the task-driven perceptual (TDP) loss that enables the SR network to acquire task-specific knowledge from a network tailored for a specific task. Moreover we propose a cross-quality patch mix and an alternate training framework that significantly enhances the efficacy of the TDP loss by addressing potential problems when employing the TDP loss.

For injecting a backdoor existing attacks depend on a large amount of additional data to maliciously fine-tune the entire pre-trained CLIP model which makes them inapplicable to data-limited scenarios. In this work motivated by the recent success of learnable prompts we address this problem by injecting a backdoor into the CLIP model in the prompt learning stage. Our method named BadCLIP is built on a novel and effective mechanism in backdoor attacks on CLIP i.e. influencing both the image and text encoders with the trigger. It consists of a learnable trigger applied to images and a trigger-aware context generator such that the trigger can change text features via trigger-aware prompts resulting in a powerful and generalizable attack.

First the grid representations are optimized with the first frames of video sequences and then the physical properties are optimized through video sequences utilizing the fixed first-frame grid representations. This limitation can be critical when learning of the geometric structure is difficult for example in a few-shot (sparse view) setting. To overcome this limitation we propose Lagrangian particle optimization (LPO) in which the positions and features of particles are optimized through video sequences in Lagrangian space. This method allows for the optimization of the geometric structure across the entire video sequence within the physical constraints imposed by the MPM. The experimental results demonstrate that the LPO is useful for geometric correction and physical identification in sparse-view settings."},

Unlike previous approaches that treat the source and target point sets as separate entities we develop a holistic framework where they are formulated as clustering centroids and clustering members separately. We then adopt Tikhonov regularization with an ?1-induced Laplacian kernel instead of the commonly used Gaussian kernel to ensure smooth and more robust displacement fields. Our formulation delivers closed-form solutions theoretical guarantees independence from dimensions and the ability to handle large deformations. Subsequently we introduce a clustering-improved Nystrom method to effectively reduce the computational complexity and storage of the Gram matrix to linear while providing a rigorous bound for the low rank approximation. Our method achieves high accuracy results across various scenarios and surpasses competitors by a significant margin particularly on shapes with substantial deformations. Additionally we demonstrate the versatility of our method in challenging tasks such as shape transfer and medical registration."},

However network rankings estimated by previous training-free NAS methods have shown weak correlations with the performance. To address this issue we propose AZ-NAS a novel approach that leverages the ensemble of various zero-cost proxies to enhance the correlation between a predicted ranking of networks and the ground truth substantially in terms of the performance. To achieve this we introduce four novel zero-cost proxies that are complementary to each other analyzing distinct traits of architectures in the views of expressivity progressivity trainability and complexity. The proxy scores can be obtained simultaneously within a single forward and backward pass making an overall NAS process highly efficient. In order to integrate the rankings predicted by our proxies effectively we introduce a non-linear ranking aggregation method that highlights the networks highly-ranked consistently across all the proxies. Experimental results conclusively demonstrate the efficacy and efficiency of AZ-NAS outperforming state-of-the-art methods on standard benchmarks all while maintaining a reasonable runtime cost."},

However generating high-resolution images with diffusion models is still challenging due to the enormous computational costs resulting in a prohibitive latency for interactive applications. In this paper we propose DistriFusion to tackle this problem by leveraging parallelism across multiple GPUs. Our method splits the model input into multiple patches and assigns each patch to a GPU. However naively implementing such an algorithm breaks the interaction between patches and loses fidelity while incorporating such an interaction will incur tremendous communication overhead. To overcome this dilemma we observe the high similarity between the input from adjacent diffusion steps and propose Displaced Patch Parallelism which takes advantage of the sequential nature of the diffusion process by reusing the pre-computed feature maps from the previous timestep to provide context for the current step. Therefore our method supports asynchronous communication which can be pipelined by computation. Extensive experiments show that our method can be applied to recent Stable Diffusion XL with no quality degradation and achieve up to a 6.1x speedup on eight NVIDIA A100s compared to one.

Segment-Anything (SAM) among others is the state-of-the-art image segmentation foundation model demonstrating strong zero/few-shot generalization. Despite the success recent studies reveal the weakness of SAM under strong distribution shift. In particular SAM performs awkwardly on corrupted natural images camouflaged images medical images etc. Motivated by the observations we aim to develop a self-training based strategy to adapt SAM to target distribution. Given the unique challenges of large source dataset high computation cost and incorrect pseudo label we propose a weakly supervised self-training architecture with anchor regularization and low-rank finetuning to improve the robustness and computation efficiency of adaptation. We validate the effectiveness on 5 types of downstream segmentation tasks including natural clean/corrupted images medical images camouflaged images and robotic images.

These techniques typically select pseudo labels i.e. 3D boxes to supervise models for the target domain. However this selection process inevitably introduces unreliable 3D boxes in which 3D points cannot be definitively assigned as foreground or background. Previous techniques mitigate this by reweighting these boxes as pseudo labels but these boxes can still poison the training process. To resolve this problem in this paper we propose a novel pseudo label refinery framework. Specifically in the selection process to improve the reliability of pseudo boxes we propose a complementary augmentation strategy. This strategy involves either removing all points within an unreliable box or replacing it with a high-confidence box. Moreover the point numbers of instances in high-beam datasets are considerably higher than those in low-beam datasets also degrading the quality of pseudo labels during the training process. We alleviate this issue by generating additional proposals and aligning RoI features across different domains. Experimental results demonstrate that our method effectively enhances the quality of pseudo labels and consistently surpasses the state-of-the-art methods on six autonomous driving benchmarks.

With these models taking on increasingly central roles in various applications the need to understand their behavior and enhance interpretability has become paramount. To investigate the impact of changes in training data on a pre-trained model a common approach is leave-one-out retraining. This entails systematically altering the training dataset by removing specific samples to observe resulting changes within the model. However retraining the model for each altered dataset presents a significant computational challenge given the need to perform this operation for every dataset variation. In this paper we introduce an efficient framework for assessing data impact comprising offline training and online evaluation stages. During the offline training phase we approximate the influence of training data on the target model through a distilled synset formulated as a reversed gradient matching problem. For online evaluation we expedite the leave-one-out process using the synset which is then utilized to compute the attribution matrix based on the evaluation objective. Experimental evaluations including training data attribution and assessments of data quality demonstrate that our proposed method achieves comparable model behavior evaluation while significantly speeding up the process compared to the direct retraining method."},

Holodeck can generate diverse scenes e.g. arcades spas and museums adjust the designs for styles and can capture the semantics of complex queries such as \"apartment for a researcher with a cat\" and \"office of a professor who is a fan of Star Wars\". Holodeck leverages a large language model (i.e. GPT-4) for common sense knowledge about what the scene might look like and uses a large collection of 3D assets from Objaverse to populate the scene with diverse objects. To address the challenge of positioning objects correctly we prompt GPT-4 to generate spatial relational constraints between objects and then optimize the layout to satisfy those constraints. Our large-scale human evaluation shows that annotators prefer Holodeck over manually designed procedural baselines in residential scenes and that Holodeck can produce high-quality outputs for diverse scene types. We also demonstrate an exciting application of Holodeck in Embodied AI training agents to navigate in novel scenes like music rooms and daycares without human-constructed data which is a significant step forward in developing general-purpose embodied agents."},

Different from traditional cameras each pixel in spike cameras records the arrival of photons continuously by firing binary spikes at an ultra-fine temporal granularity. In this process multiple factors impact the imaging including the photons' Poisson arrival thermal noises from circuits and quantization effects in spike readout. These factors introduce fluctuations to spikes making the recorded spike intervals unstable and unable to reflect accurate light intensities. In this paper we present an approach to deal with spike fluctuations and boost spike camera image reconstruction. We first analyze the quantization effects and reveal the unbiased estimation attribute of the reciprocal of differential of spike firing time (DSFT). Based on this we propose a spike representation module to use DSFT with multiple orders for fluctuation suppression where DSFT with higher orders indicates spike integration duration between multiple spikes. We also propose a module for inter-moment feature alignment at multiple granularities. The coarser alignment is based on patch-level cross-attention with a local search strategy and the finer alignment is based on deformable convolution at the pixel level.

{"title": "Adversarial Distillation Based on Slack Matching and Attribution Region Alignment", "authors": "Shenglin Yin, Zhen Xiao, Mingxuan Song, Jieyi Long", "abstract": "Adversarial distillation (AD) is a highly effective method for enhancing the robustness of small models. Contrary to expectations a high-performing teacher model does not always result in a more robust student model. This is due to two main reasons. First when there are significant differences in predictions between the teacher model and the student model exact matching of predicted values using KL divergence interferes with training leading to poor performance of existing methods. Second matching solely based on the output prevents the student model from fully understanding the behavior of the teacher model. To address these challenges this paper proposes a novel AD method named SmaraAD. During the training process we facilitate the student model in better understanding the teacher model's behavior by aligning the attribution region that the student model focuses on with that of the teacher model. Concurrently we relax the condition of exact matching in KL divergence and replace it with a more flexible matching criterion thereby enhancing the model's robustness. Extensive experiments substantiate the effectiveness of our method in improving the robustness of small models outperforming previous SOTA methods."},

For example text-to-image models and their 3D-aware variants are trained on internet-scale image datasets and can be used to produce scenes with realistic appearance and 3D structure---but no motion. Text-to-video models are trained on relatively smaller video datasets and can produce scenes with motion but poorer appearance and 3D structure.

Recently VMD-Net was proposed as the first video mirror detection technique by modeling dual correspondences between the inside and outside of the mirror both spatially and temporally. However this approach is not reliable as correspondences can occur completely inside or outside of the mirrors. In addition the proposed dataset VMD-D contains many small mirrors limiting its applicability to real-world scenarios. To address these problems we developed a more challenging dataset that includes mirrors of various shapes and sizes at different locations of the frames providing a better reflection of real-world scenarios. Next we observed that the motions between the inside and outside of the mirror are often inconsistent. For instance when moving in front of a mirror the motion inside the mirror is often much smaller than the motion outside due to increased depth perception. With these observations we propose modeling inconsistent motion cues to detect mirrors and a new network with two novel modules. The Motion Attention Module (MAM) explicitly models inconsistent motions around mirrors via optical flow and the Motion-Guided Edge Detection Module (MEDM) uses motions to guide mirror edge feature learning.

However most existing FL methods assume that domain labels are provided during training and their evaluation imposes explicit constraints on the number of domains which must strictly match the number of clients. Because of the underutilization of numerous edge devices and additional cross-client domain annotations in the real world such restrictions may be impractical and involve potential privacy leaks. In this paper we propose an efficient and novel approach called Disentangled Prompt Tuning (DiPrompT) a method that tackles the above restrictions by learning adaptive prompts for domain generalization in a distributed manner. Specifically we first design two types of prompts i.e. global prompt to capture general knowledge across all clients and domain prompts to capture domain-specific knowledge. They eliminate the restriction on the one-to-one mapping between source domains and local clients. Furthermore a dynamic query metric is introduced to automatically search the suitable domain label for each sample which includes two-substep text-image alignments based on prompt tuning without labor-intensive annotation. Extensive experiments on multiple datasets demonstrate that our DiPrompT achieves superior domain generalization performance over state-of-the-art FL methods when domain labels are not provided and even outperforms many centralized learning methods using domain labels."},

We demonstrate that our approach can yield more accurate synthesis compared to recent state-of-the-art including distillation-based 3D inference and prior multi-view generation methods. We also evaluate the geometry induced by our multi-view depth prediction and find that it yields a more accurate representation than other direct 3D inference approaches."},

It inherently results in a fundamental trade-off between perception ability and communication cost. To address this bottleneck issue our core idea is to optimize the collaborative messages from two key aspects: representation and selection. The proposed codebook-based message representation enables the transmission of integer codes rather than high-dimensional feature maps. The proposed information-filling-driven message selection optimizes local messages to collectively fill each agent's information demand preventing information overflow among multiple agents. By integrating these two designs we propose CodeFilling a novel communication-efficient collaborative perception system which significantly advances the perception-communication trade-off and is inclusive to both homogeneous and heterogeneous collaboration settings. We evaluate CodeFilling in both a real-world dataset DAIR-V2X and a new simulation dataset OPV2VH+. Results show that CodeFilling outperforms previous SOTA Where2comm on DAIR-V2X/OPV2VH+ with 1333/1206x lower communication volume. Our code is available at https://github.com/PhyllisH/CodeFilling."},

In this work we propose VisualFactChecker (VFC) a flexible training-free pipeline that generates high-fidelity and detailed captions for both 2D images and 3D objects. VFC consists of three steps: 1) proposal where image-to-text captioning models propose multiple initial captions; 2) verification where a large language model (LLM) utilizes tools such as object detection and VQA models to fact-check proposed captions; 3) captioning where an LLM generates the final caption by summarizing caption proposals and the fact check verification results. In this step VFC can flexibly generate captions in various styles following complex instructions. We conduct comprehensive captioning evaluations using four metrics: 1) CLIP-Score for image-text similarity; 2) CLIP-Image-Score for measuring the image-image similarity between the original and the reconstructed image generated by a text-to-image model using the caption. 3) human study on Amazon Mechanical Turk; 4) GPT-4V for fine-grained evaluation. Evaluation results show that VFC outperforms state-of-the-art open-sourced captioning methods for 2D images on the COCO dataset and 3D assets on the Objaverse dataset. Our study demonstrates that by combining open-source models into a pipeline we can attain captioning capability comparable to proprietary models such as GPT-4V despite being over 10x smaller in model size."},

Our method is real-time and produces high-fidelity and view-consistent output suitable for 3D teleconferencing systems based on holographic displays. Existing cutting-edge 3D-aware reenactment methods often use neural radiance fields or 3D meshes to produce view-consistent appearance encoding but at the same time they rely on linear face models such as 3DMM to achieve its disentanglement with facial expressions. As a result their reenactment results often exhibit identity leakage from the driver or have unnatural expressions. To address these problems we propose a neural self-supervised disentanglement approach that lifts both the source image and driver video frame into a shared 3D volumetric representation based on tri-planes. This representation can then be freely manipulated with expression tri-planes extracted from the driving images and rendered from an arbitrary view using neural radiance fields. We achieve this disentanglement via self-supervised learning on a large in-the-wild video dataset. We further introduce a highly effective fine-tuning approach to improve the generalizability of the 3D lifting using the same real-world data. We demonstrate state-of-the-art performance on a wide range of datasets and also showcase high-quality 3D-aware head reenactment on highly challenging and diverse subjects including non-frontal head poses and complex expressions for both source and driver."},

Such limitations can be exacerbated by nonlinear object motion particularly from an ego-centric viewpoint. It becomes evident that to address these challenges the key lies in exploiting temporal feature relation over an extended horizon and enforcing spatial motion consistence for effective association. To this end this paper proposes SIRA (Scalable Inter-frame Relation and Association) with two designs. First inspired by Swin Transformer we introduce extended temporal relation generalizing the existing temporal relation layer from two consecutive frames to multiple inter-frames with temporally regrouped window attention for scalability. Second we propose motion consistency track with the concept of a pseudo-tracklet generated from observational data for better trajectory prediction and subsequent object association. Our approach achieves 58.11 mAP@0.5 for oriented object detection and 47.79 MOTA for multiple object tracking on the Radiate dataset surpassing previous state-of-the-art by a margin of +4.11 mAP@0.5 and +9.94 MOTA respectively."},

Different from existing methods which apply stylization to trained neural radiance fields at the voxel level our approach draws inspiration from image-to-painting methods simulating the progressive painting process of human artwork with vector strokes. We develop a palette of stylized 3D strokes from basic primitives and splines and consider the 3D scene stylization task as a multi-view reconstruction process based on these 3D stroke primitives. Instead of directly searching for the parameters of these 3D strokes which would be too costly we introduce a differentiable renderer that allows optimizing stroke parameters using gradient descent and propose a training scheme to alleviate the vanishing gradient issue. The extensive evaluation demonstrates that our approach effectively synthesizes 3D scenes with significant geometric and aesthetic stylization while maintaining a consistent appearance across different views.

To effectively detect incorrectly labeled instances previous works have mostly relied on distinguishable training signals such as training loss as indicators to differentiate between clean and noisy labels. However they have limitations in that the training signals incompletely reveal the model's behavior and are not effectively generalized to various noise types resulting in limited detection accuracy. In this paper we propose DynaCor framework that distinguishes incorrectly labeled instances from correctly labeled ones based on the dynamics of the training signals. To cope with the absence of supervision for clean and noisy labels DynaCor first introduces a label corruption strategy that augments the original dataset with intentionally corrupted labels enabling indirect simulation of the model's behavior on noisy labels. Then DynaCor learns to identify clean and noisy instances by inducing two clearly distinguishable clusters from the latent representations of training dynamics. Our comprehensive experiments show that DynaCor outperforms the state-of-the-art competitors and shows strong robustness to various noise types and noise rates."},

Due to the limited research in structured attacks imposing consistency checks on natural multi-object scenes is a practical defense against conventional adversarial attacks. More desired attacks should be able to fool defenses with such consistency checks. Therefore we present the first approach GLOW that copes with various attack requests by generating global layout-aware adversarial attacks in which both categorical and geometric layout constraints are explicitly established. Specifically we focus on object detection tasks and given a victim image GLOW first localizes victim objects according to target labels. And then it generates multiple attack plans together with their context-consistency scores. GLOW on the one hand is capable of handling various types of requests including single or multiple victim objects with or without specified victim objects. On the other hand it produces a consistency score for each attack plan reflecting the overall contextual consistency that both semantic category and global scene layout are considered. We conduct our experiments on MS COCO and Pascal. Extensive experimental results demonstrate that we can achieve about 30% average relative improvement compared to state-of-the-art methods in conventional single object attack request; Moreover such superiority is also valid across more generic attack requests under both white-box and zero-query black-box settings. Finally we conduct comprehensive human analysis which not only validates our claim further but also provides strong evidence that our evaluation metrics reflect human reviews well."},

This paper establishes theoretical limits (Cramer Rao bounds) on 3D point localization and tracking with PSF-engineered event cameras. Using these bounds we first demonstrate that existing Fisher phase masks are already near-optimal for localizing static flashing point sources (e.g. blinking fluorescent molecules). We then demonstrate that existing designs are sub-optimal for tracking moving point sources and proceed to use our theory to design optimal phase masks and binary amplitude masks for this task. To overcome the non-convexity of the design problem we leverage novel implicit neural representation based parameterizations of the phase and amplitude masks. We demonstrate the efficacy of our designs through extensive simulations. We also validate our method with a simple prototype."},

With such a design of mimicking human beings our Vlogger can generate vlogs through explainable cooperation of top-down planning and bottom-up shooting. More over we introduce a novel video diffusion model ShowMaker which serves as a videographer in our Vlogger for generating the video snippet of each shooting scene. By incorporating Script and Actor attentively as textual and visual prompts it can effectively enhance spatial-temporal coherence in the snippet. Besides we design a concise mixed training paradigm for ShowMaker boosting its capacity for both T2V generation and prediction. Finally the extensive experiments show that our method achieves state-of-the-art performance on zero-shot T2V generation and prediction tasks.

Its formulation is nonconvex and it is faced with highly corrupted measurements. Cycle consistency has been effective in addressing these challenges. However computationally efficient solutions are needed for cycles longer than three especially in practical scenarios where 3-cycles are unavailable. To overcome this computational bottleneck we propose an algorithm for group synchronization that leverages information from cycles of lengths ranging from three to six with a complexity of O(n^3) (or O(n^ 2.373 ) when using a faster matrix multiplication algorithm). We establish non-trivial theory for this and related methods that achieves competitive sample complexity assuming the uniform corruption model. To advocate the practical need for our method we consider distributed group synchronization which requires at least 4-cycles and we illustrate state-of-the-art performance by our method in this context."},

Recent advancements in human-based neural rendering have enabled high-quality geometry and appearance reconstruction of clothed humans from just monocular videos. However these methods bake intrinsic properties such as albedo material and environment lighting into a single entangled neural representation. On the other hand only a handful of works tackle the problem of estimating geometry and disentangled appearance properties of clothed humans from monocular videos. They usually achieve limited quality and disentanglement due to approximations of secondary shading effects via learned MLPs. In this work we propose to model secondary shading effects explicitly via Monte-Carlo ray tracing. We model the rendering process of clothed humans as a volumetric scattering process and combine ray tracing with body articulation. Our approach can recover high-quality geometry albedo material and lighting properties of clothed humans from a single monocular video without requiring supervised pre-training using ground truth materials. Furthermore since we explicitly model the volumetric scattering process and ray tracing our model naturally generalizes to novel poses enabling animation of the reconstructed avatar in novel lighting conditions."},

To train our model we rely only on the availability of bitmap sketches with their brief captions and do not require any pixel-level annotations. To obtain generalization to a large set of sketches and categories we build on a vision transformer encoder pretrained with the CLIP model. We freeze the text encoder and perform visual-prompt tuning of the visual encoder branch while introducing a set of critical modifications. Firstly we augment the classical key-query (k-q) self-attention blocks with value-value (v-v) self-attention blocks. Central to our model is a two-level hierarchical network design that enables efficient semantic disentanglement: The first level ensures holistic scene sketch encoding and the second level focuses on individual categories. We then in the second level of the hierarchy introduce a cross-attention between textual and visual branches. Our method outperforms zero-shot CLIP pixel accuracy of segmentation results by 37 points reaching an accuracy of 85.5% on the FS-COCO sketch dataset. Finally we conduct a user study that allows us to identify further improvements needed over our method to reconcile machine and human understanding of scene sketches."},

Prior work has illustrated the effectiveness of employing occupancy-based or distance-based virtual sensors to extract hand-object interaction features. Nonetheless these methods show limited generalizability across object categories shapes and sizes. We hypothesize that this is due to two reasons: 1) the limited expressiveness of employed virtual sensors and 2) scarcity of available training data. To tackle this challenge we introduce a novel joint-centered sensor designed to reason about local object geometry near potential interaction regions. The sensor queries for object surface points in the neighbourhood of each hand joint. As an important step towards mitigating the learning complexity we transform the points from global frame to hand template frame and use a shared module to process sensor features of each individual joint. This is followed by a spatio-temporal transformer network aimed at capturing correlation among the joints in different dimensions. Moreover we devise simple heuristic rules to augment the limited training sequences with vast static hand grasping samples. This leads to a broader spectrum of grasping types observed during training in turn enhancing our model's generalization capability. We evaluate on two public datasets GRAB and InterCap where our method shows superiority over baselines both quantitatively and perceptually."},

Traditionally MIL interpretability is limited to identifying salient regions deemed pertinent for downstream tasks offering little insight to the end-user (pathologist) regarding the rationale behind these selections. To address this we propose Self-Interpretable MIL (SI-MIL) a method intrinsically designed for interpretability from the very outset. SI-MIL employs a deep MIL framework to guide an interpretable branch grounded on handcrafted pathological features facilitating linear predictions. Beyond identifying salient regions SI-MIL uniquely provides feature-level interpretations rooted in pathological insights for WSIs. Notably SI-MIL with its linear prediction constraints challenges the prevalent myth of an inevitable trade-off between model interpretability and performance demonstrating competitive results compared to state-of-the-art methods on WSI-level prediction tasks across three cancer types. In addition we thoroughly benchmark the local- and global-interpretability of SI-MIL in terms of statistical analysis a domain expert study and desiderata of interpretability namely user-friendliness and faithfulness."},

Existing methods either rely on domain labels to align domain-invariant feature spaces or disentangle generalizable features from the whole sample which inevitably lead to the distortion of semantic feature structures and achieve limited generalization. In this work we make use of large-scale VLMs like CLIP and leverage the textual feature to dynamically adjust the classifier's weights for exploring generalizable visual features. Specifically we propose a novel Class Free Prompt Learning (CFPL) paradigm for DG FAS which utilizes two lightweight transformers namely Content Q-Former (CQF) and Style Q-Former (SQF) to learn the different semantic prompts conditioned on content and style features by using a set of learnable query vectors respectively. Thus the generalizable prompt can be learned by two improvements: (1) A Prompt-Text Matched (PTM) supervision is introduced to ensure CQF learns visual representation that is most informative of the content description. (2) A Diversified Style Prompt (DSP) technology is proposed to diversify the learning of style prompts by mixing feature statistics between instance-specific styles. Finally the learned text features modulate visual features to generalization through the designed Prompt Modulation (PM). Extensive experiments show that the CFPL is effective and outperforms the state-of-the-art methods on several cross-domain datasets."},

We then show that prequalified generated images can be identified reliably by classifiers that only look at geometric properties. We use three such classifiers. All three classifiers are denied access to image pixels and look only at derived geometric features. The first classifier looks at the perspective field of the image the second looks at lines detected in the image and the third looks at relations between detected objects and shadows. Our procedure detects generated images more reliably than SOTA local signal based detectors for images from a number of distinct generators. Saliency maps suggest that the classifiers can identify geometric problems reliably. We conclude that current generators cannot reliably reproduce geometric properties of real images."},

In this line of research existing methods typically follow an inversion-and-distillation paradigm in which a generative adversarial network on-the-fly trained with the guidance of the pre-trained teacher network is used to synthesize a large-scale sample set for knowledge distillation. In this paper we reexamine this common data-free knowledge distillation paradigm showing that there is considerable room to improve the overall training efficiency through a lens of \"small-scale inverted data for knowledge distillation\". In light of three empirical observations indicating the importance of how to balance class distributions in terms of synthetic sample diversity and difficulty during both data inversion and distillation processes we propose Small Scale Data-free Knowledge Distillation (SSD-KD). In formulation SSD-KD introduces a modulating function to balance synthetic samples and a priority sampling function to select proper samples facilitated by a dynamic replay buffer and a reinforcement learning strategy. As a result SSD-KD can perform distillation training conditioned on an extremely small scale of synthetic samples (e.g. 10x less than the original training data scale) making the overall training efficiency one or two orders of magnitude faster than many mainstream methods while retaining superior or competitive model performance as demonstrated on popular image classification and semantic segmentation benchmarks.

These sparser regimes present new challenges as a 4-line LiDAR increases the distance between pixels without depth and their nearest depth point sixfold from 5 pixels to 30 pixels compared to 64 lines. Observing that existing methods struggle with sparse and variable distribution depth maps we propose an Affinity-Based Shift Correction (ASC) module that iteratively aligns depth predictions to input depth based on predicted affinities between image pixels and depth points. Our framework enables each depth point to adaptively influence and improve predictions across the image leading to largely improved results for fewer-line fewer-point and variable sparsity settings. Further we show improved performance in domain transfer from KITTI to nuScenes and from random sampling to irregular point distributions. Our correction module can easily be added to any depth completion or RGB-only depth estimation model notably allowing the latter to perform both completion and estimation with a single model."},

To address this problem this work proposes NetTrack an efficient generic and affordable tracking framework to introduce fine-grained learning that is robust to dynamicity. Specifically NetTrack constructs a dynamicity-aware association with a fine-grained Net leveraging point-level visual cues. Correspondingly a fine-grained sampler and matching method have been incorporated. Furthermore NetTrack learns object-text correspondence for fine-grained localization. To evaluate MOT in extremely dynamic open-world scenarios a bird flock tracking (BFT) dataset is constructed which exhibits high dynamicity with diverse species and open-world scenarios. Comprehensive evaluation on BFT validates the effectiveness of fine-grained learning on object dynamicity and thorough transfer experiments on challenging open-world benchmarks i.e. TAO TAO-OW AnimalTrack and GMOT-40 validate the strong generalization ability of NetTrack even without finetuning."},

Now text-to-image foundation models are widely applied to various downstream image synthesis tasks such as controllable image generation and image editing while downstream video synthesis tasks are less explored for several reasons. First it requires huge memory and computation overhead to train a video generation foundation model. Even with video foundation models additional costly training is still required for downstream video synthesis tasks. Second although some works extend image diffusion models into videos in a training-free manner temporal consistency cannot be well preserved. Finally these adaption methods are specifically designed for one task and fail to generalize to different tasks. To mitigate these issues we propose a training-free general-purpose video synthesis framework coined as BIVDiff via bridging specific image diffusion models and general text-to-video foundation diffusion models. Specifically we first use a specific image diffusion model (e.g. ControlNet and Instruct Pix2Pix) for frame-wise video generation then perform Mixed Inversion on the generated video and finally input the inverted latents into the video diffusion models (e.g. VidRD and ZeroScope) for temporal smoothing. This decoupled framework enables flexible image model selection for different purposes with strong task generalization and high efficiency.

Despite the practical success the mechanisms behind SAM's generalization enhancements remain elusive limiting its progress in deep learning optimization. In this work we investigate SAM's core components for generalization improvement and introduce \"Friendly-SAM\" (F-SAM) to further enhance SAM's generalization. Our investigation reveals the key role of batch-specific stochastic gradient noise within the adversarial perturbation i.e. the current minibatch gradient which significantly influences SAM's generalization performance. By decomposing the adversarial perturbation in SAM into full gradient and stochastic gradient noise components we discover that relying solely on the full gradient component degrades generalization while excluding it leads to improved performance. The possible reason lies in the full gradient component's increase in sharpness loss for the entire dataset creating inconsistencies with the subsequent sharpness minimization step solely on the current minibatch data. Inspired by these insights F-SAM aims to mitigate the negative effects of the full gradient component. It removes the full gradient estimated by an exponentially moving average (EMA) of historical stochastic gradients and then leverages stochastic gradient noise for improved generalization. Moreover we provide theoretical validation for the EMA approximation and prove the convergence of F-SAM on non-convex problems. Extensive experiments demonstrate the superior generalization performance and robustness of F-SAM over vanilla SAM. Code is available at https://github.com/nblt/F-SAM."},

Whiteness the impressive capabilities in multimodal understanding of Vision Language Foundation Model CLIP a recent two-stage CLIP-based method employs automated prompt engineering to obtain specific textual labels for classifying pedestrians. However we note that the predefined soft prompts may be inadequate in expressing the entire visual context and struggle to generalize to unseen classes. This paper presents an end-to-end Prompt-driven Semantic Guidance (PromptSG) framework that harnesses the rich semantics inherent in CLIP. Specifically we guide the model to attend to regions that are semantically faithful to the prompt. To provide personalized language descriptions for specific individuals we propose learning pseudo tokens that represent specific visual contexts. This design not only facilitates learning fine-grained attribute information but also can inherently leverage language prompts during inference. Without requiring additional labeling efforts our PromptSG achieves state-of-the-art by over 10% on MSMT17 and nearly 5% on the Market-1501 benchmark."},

When training a diffusion or flow models on 3D shapes a crucial design choice is the shape representation. An effective shape representation needs to adhere three design principles: it should allow an efficient conversion of large 3D datasets to the representation form; it should provide a good tradeoff of approximation power versus number of parameters; and it should have a simple tensorial form that is compatible with existing powerful neural architectures. While standard 3D shape representations such as volumetric grids and point clouds do not adhere to all these principles simultaneously we advocate in this paper a new representation that does. We introduce Mosaic-SDF (M-SDF): a simple 3D shape representation that approximates the Signed Distance Function (SDF) of a given shape by using a set of local grids spread near the shape's boundary. The M-SDF representation is fast to compute for each shape individually making it readily parallelizable; it is parameter efficient as it only covers the space around the shape's boundary; and it has a simple matrix form compatible with Transformer-based architectures. We demonstrate the efficacy of the M-SDF representation by using it to train a 3D generative flow model including class-conditioned generation with the ShapeNetCore-V2 (3D Warehouse) dataset and text-to-3D generation using a dataset of about 600k caption-shape pairs."},

The edited results remain plausible photo-real and preserve object identity. Diffusion handles address a critically missing facet of generative image-based creative design. Our key insight is to lift diffusion activations for a selected object to 3D using a proxy depth 3D-transform the depth and associated activations and project them back to image space. The diffusion process guided by the manipulated activations produces plausible edited images showing complex 3D occlusion and lighting effects. We evaluate diffusion handles: quantitatively on a large synthetic data benchmark; and qualitatively by a user study showing our output to be more plausible and better than prior art at both 3D editing and identity control."},

However current prevailing facial texture generation methods generally suffer from low-quality texture identity information loss and inadequate handling of occlusions. To solve these problems we introduce an Identity-Conditioned Latent Diffusion Model for face UV-texture generation (UV-IDM) to generate photo-realistic textures based on the Basel Face Model (BFM). UV-IDM leverages the powerful texture generation capacity of a latent diffusion model (LDM) to obtain detailed facial textures. To preserve the identity during the reconstruction procedure we design an identity-conditioned module that can utilize any in-the-wild image as a robust condition for the LDM to guide texture generation. UV-IDM can be easily adapted to different BFM-based methods as a high-fidelity texture generator. Furthermore in light of the limited accessibility of most existing UV-texture datasets we build a large-scale and publicly available UV-texture dataset based on BFM termed BFM-UV. Extensive experiments show that our UV-IDM can generate high-fidelity textures in 3D face reconstruction within seconds while maintaining image consistency bringing new state-of-the-art performance in facial texture generation."},

However in current methods the image splitting makes the information of latent variables being uniformly distributed in each subimage and causes inadequate use of latent variables in addition to posterior collapse. To tackle these issues we introduce Bit Plane Slicing (BPS) splitting images in the bit plane dimension with the considerations on different importance for latent variables. Thus BPS provides a more effective representation by arranging subimages with decreasing importance for latent variables. To solve the problem of the increased number of dimensions caused by BPS we further propose a dimension-tailored autoregressive model that tailors autoregression methods for each dimension based on their characteristics efficiently capturing the dependencies in plane space and color dimensions. As shown in the extensive experimental results our method demonstrates the superior compression performance with comparable inference speed when compared to the state-of-the-art normalizing-flow-based methods.

However their conspicuous and easily detectable nature challenge their practicality in real-world setting. To address this recent work has proposed using Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs) to generate naturalistic patches that may not attract human attention. However such approaches suffer from a limited latent space making it challenging to produce a patch that is efficient stealthy and robust to multiple real-world transformations. This paper introduces a novel approach that produces a Dynamic Adversarial Patch (DAP) designed to overcome these limitations. DAP maintains a naturalistic appearance while optimizing attack efficiency and robustness to real-world transformations. The approach involves redefining the optimization problem and introducing a novel objective function that incorporates a similarity metric to guide the patch's creation. Unlike GAN-based techniques the DAP directly modifies pixel values within the patch providing increased flexibility and adaptability to multiple transformations. Furthermore most clothing-based physical attacks assume static objects and ignore the possible transformations caused by non-rigid deformation due to changes in a person's pose. To address this limitation a `Creases Transformation' (CT) block is introduced enhancing the patch's resilience to a variety of real-world distortions. Experimental results demonstrate that the proposed approach outperforms state-of-the-art attacks achieving a success rate of up to 82.28% in the digital world when targeting the YOLOv7 detector and 65% in the physical world when targeting YOLOv3tiny detector deployed in edge-based smart cameras."},

To enable the capability of CLIP to perceive dynamic information in videos existing works are dedicated to equipping the visual encoder with various temporal modules. However these methods exhibit \"asymmetry\" between the visual and textual sides with neither temporal descriptions in input texts nor temporal modules in text encoder. This limitation hinders the potential of language supervision emphasized in CLIP and restricts the learning of temporal features as the text encoder has demonstrated limited proficiency in motion understanding. To address this issue we propose leveraging \"MoTion-Enhanced Descriptions\" (MoTED) to facilitate the extraction of distinctive temporal features in videos. Specifically we first generate discriminative motion-related descriptions via querying GPT-4 to compare easy-confusing action categories. Then we incorporate both the visual and textual encoders with additional perception modules to process the video frames and generated descriptions respectively. Finally we adopt a contrastive loss to align the visual and textual motion features. Extensive experiments on five benchmarks show that MoTED surpasses state-of-the-art methods with convincing gaps laying a solid foundation for empowering CLIP with strong temporal modeling."},

Our representation is further augmented with dynamic properties to support pose-dependent appearance modeling where a dynamic appearance network along with an optimizable feature tensor is designed to learn the motion-to-appearance mapping. Moreover by leveraging the differentiable motion condition our method enables a joint optimization of motions and appearances during avatar modeling which helps to tackle the long-standing issue of inaccurate motion estimation in monocular settings.

These readouts can encode single-image properties such as pose depth and edges; or higher-order properties that relate multiple images such as correspondence and appearance similarity. Furthermore by comparing the readout estimates to a user-defined target and back-propagating the gradient through the readout head these estimates can be used to guide the sampling process. Compared to prior methods for conditional generation Readout Guidance requires significantly fewer added parameters and training samples and offers a convenient and simple recipe for reproducing different forms of conditional control under a single framework with a single architecture and sampling procedure. We showcase these benefits in the applications of drag-based manipulation identity-consistent generation and spatially aligned control."},

Through a user preference study we demonstrate that our approach significantly advances image and motion quality 3D consistency and text fidelity for text-to-4D generation compared to baseline approaches. Thanks to its motion-disentangled representation Dream-in-4D can also be easily adapted for controllable generation where appearance is defined by one or multiple images without the need to modify the motion learning stage.

While effective for logical tasks CoT is not conducive to creative problem-solving which often requires out-of-box thoughts and is crucial for innovation advancements. In this paper we explore the Leap-of-Thought (LoT) abilities within LLMs -- a non-sequential creative paradigm involving strong associations and knowledge leaps. To this end we study LLMs on the popular Oogiri game which needs participants to have good creativity and strong associative thinking for responding unexpectedly and humorously to the given image text or both and thus is suitable for LoT study. Then to investigate LLMs' LoT ability in the Oogiri game we first build a multimodal and multilingual Oogiri-GO dataset which contains over 130000 samples from the Oogiri game and observe the insufficient LoT ability or failures of most existing LLMs on the Oogiri game. Accordingly we introduce a creative Leap-of-Thought (CLoT) paradigm to improve LLM's LoT ability. CLoT first formulates the Oogiri-GO dataset into LoT-oriented instruction tuning data to train pretrained LLM for achieving certain LoT humor generation and discrimination abilities. Then CLoT designs an explorative self-refinement that encourages the LLM to generate more creative LoT data via exploring parallels between seemingly unrelated concepts and selects high-quality data to train itself for self-refinement. CLoT not only excels in humor generation in the Oogiri game as shown in Fig. 1 but also boosts creative abilities in various tasks like \"cloud guessing game\" and \"divergent association task\". These findings advance our understanding and offer a pathway to improve LLMs' creative capacities for innovative applications across domains.

{"title": "Image Restoration by Denoising Diffusion Models with Iteratively Preconditioned Guidance", "authors": "Tomer Garber, Tom Tirer", "abstract": "Training deep neural networks has become a common approach for addressing image restoration problems. An alternative for training a \"task-specific\" network for each observation model is to use pretrained deep denoisers for imposing only the signal's prior within iterative algorithms without additional training. Recently a sampling-based variant of this approach has become popular with the rise of diffusion/score-based generative models. Using denoisers for general purpose restoration requires guiding the iterations to ensure agreement of the signal with the observations. In low-noise settings guidance that is based on back-projection (BP) has been shown to be a promising strategy (used recently also under the names \"pseudoinverse\" or \"range/-space\" guidance). However the presence of noise in the observations hinders the gains from this approach. In this paper we propose a novel guidance technique based on preconditioning that allows traversing from BP-based guidance to least squares based guidance along the restoration scheme. The proposed approach is robust to noise while still having much simpler implementation than alternative methods (e.g. it does not require SVD or a large number of iterations). We use it within both an optimization scheme and a sampling-based scheme and demonstrate its advantages over existing methods for image deblurring and super-resolution."},

Existing methods broadly obey coordinate-based scheme where inlier confidence is scored through simply capturing coordinate differences in the context. However this scheme results in massive inlier misinterpretation readily consequently affecting the registration performance. In this paper we explore to extend a new definition called inlier confidence calibration (ICC) to alleviate the above issues. Firstly we provide finely initial correspondences for ICC in order to generate high quality reference point cloud copy corresponding to the source point cloud. In particular we develop a soft assignment matrix optimization theorem that offers faster speed and greater precision compared to Sinkhorn. Benefiting from the high quality reference copy we argue the neighborhood patch formed by inlier and its neighborhood should have consistency between source point cloud and its reference copy. Based on this insight we construct transformation-invariant geometric constraints and capture geometric structure consistency to calibrate inlier confidence for estimated correspondences between source point cloud and its reference copy. Finally transformation is further calculated by the weighted SVD algorithm with the calibrated inlier confidence. Our model is trained in an unsupervised manner and extensive experiments on synthetic and real-world datasets illustrate the effectiveness of the proposed method."},

We first learn a vocabulary of latent quantized embeddings using graph convolutions which inform these embeddings of the local mesh geometry and topology. These embeddings are sequenced and decoded into triangles by a decoder ensuring that they can effectively reconstruct the mesh. A transformer is then trained on this learned vocabulary to predict the index of the next embedding given previous embeddings. Once trained our model can be autoregressively sampled to generate new triangle meshes directly generating compact meshes with sharp edges more closely imitating the efficient triangulation patterns of human-crafted meshes. MeshGPT demonstrates a notable improvement over state of the art mesh generation methods with a 9% increase in shape coverage and a 30-point enhancement in FID scores across various categories."},

As a solution recent monocular 3D detection methods leverage additional modalities such as stereo image pairs and LiDAR point clouds to enhance image features at the expense of additional annotation costs. We propose using diffusion models to learn effective representations for monocular 3D detection without additional modalities or training data. We present MonoDiff a novel framework that employs the reverse diffusion process to estimate 3D bounding box and orientation. But considering the variability in bounding box sizes along different dimensions it is ineffective to sample noise from a standard Gaussian distribution. Hence we adopt a Gaussian mixture model to sample noise during the forward diffusion process and initialize the reverse diffusion process. Furthermore since the diffusion model generates the 3D parameters for a given object image we leverage 2D detection information to provide additional supervision by maintaining the correspondence between 3D/2D projection. Finally depending on the signal-to-noise ratio we incorporate a dynamic weighting scheme to account for the level of uncertainty in the supervision by projection at different timesteps.

However to predict captions with ids a two-stage approach is required: first predict captions with someone then fill in identities. In this work we present a new single stage approach that can seamlessly switch between id-aware caption generation or FITB when given a caption with blanks. Our model Movie-Identity Captioner (MICap) uses a shared auto-regressive decoder that benefits from training with FITB and full-caption generation objectives while the encoder can benefit from or disregard captions with blanks as input. Another challenge with id-aware captioning is the lack of a metric to capture subtle differences between person ids. To this end we introduce iSPICE a caption evaluation metric that focuses on identity tuples created through intermediate scene graphs. We evaluate MICap on Large-Scale Movie Description Challenge (LSMDC) where we show a 4.2% improvement in FITB accuracy and a 1-2% bump in classic captioning metrics."},

This is challenging since we only have access to video-level (weak) event labels when training but need to predict event labels at the segment (frame) level at test time. Recent methods employ multiple-instance learning (MIL) techniques that tend to focus solely on the most discriminative segments resulting in frequent misclassifications. Our idea is to first construct several prototype features for each event class by clustering key segments identified for the event in the training data. We then assign pseudo labels to all training segments based on their feature similarities with these prototypes and re-train the model under weak and strong supervision. We facilitate this by structuring the feature space with contrastive learning using pseudo labels. Experiments show that we outperform existing methods for weakly-supervised AVVP. We also show that learning with weak and iteratively re-estimated pseudo labels can be interpreted as an expectation-maximization (EM) algorithm providing further insight for our training procedure."},

We identify the ability to learn new meanings and their compositionality with known ones as two key properties of a personalized system. We show that the available benchmarks offer a limited validation of personalized textual concept learning from images with respect to the above properties and introduce ConCon-Chi as a benchmark for both personalized TIR and TIG designed to fill this gap. We modelled the new-meaning concepts by crafting chimeric objects and formulating a large varied set of contexts where we photographed each object.

Moreover we propose a novel paradigm namely Kernel-to-Displacement generation for point generation where point cloud upsampling is reformulated as the deformation of kernel points. Specifically we propose KP-Queries which is a set of kernel points with predefined positions and learned features to serve as the initial state of upsampling. Using cross-attention mechanisms we achieve interactions between RepKPoints and KP-Queries and subsequently KP-Queries are converted to displacement features followed by a MLP to predict the new positions of KP-Queries which serve as the generated points. Extensive experimental results demonstrate that RepKPU outperforms state-of-the-art methods on several widely-used benchmark datasets with high efficiency."},

While existing state-of-the-art DMs are competent to achieve high-resolution video generation they may largely suffer from key limitations (e.g. action occurrence disorders crude video motions) with respect to the intricate temporal dynamics modeling one of the crux of video synthesis. In this work we investigate strengthening the awareness of video dynamics for DMs for high-quality T2V generation. Inspired by human intuition we design an innovative dynamic scene manager (dubbed as Dysen) module which includes (step-1) extracting from input text the key actions with proper time-order arrangement (step-2) transforming the action schedules into the dynamic scene graph (DSG) representations and (step-3) enriching the scenes in the DSG with sufficient and reasonable details. Taking advantage of the existing powerful LLMs (e.g. ChatGPT) via in-context learning Dysen realizes (nearly) human-level temporal dynamics understanding. Finally the resulting video DSG with rich action scene details is encoded as fine-grained spatio-temporal features integrated into the backbone T2V DM for video generating. Experiments on popular T2V datasets suggest that our Dysen-VDM consistently outperforms prior arts with significant margins especially in scenarios with complex actions."},

This early fusion of audio and visual cues demonstrated through cognitive psychology and neuroscience research offers promising potential for developing multimodal perception models. However training early fusion architectures poses significant challenges as the increased model expressivity requires robust learning frameworks to harness their enhanced capabilities. In this paper we address this challenge by leveraging the masked reconstruction framework previously successful in unimodal settings to train audio-visual encoders with early fusion. Additionally we propose an attention-based fusion module that captures interactions between local audio and visual representations enhancing the model's ability to capture fine-grained interactions. While effective this procedure can become computationally intractable as the number of local representations increases. Thus to address the computational complexity we propose an alternative procedure that factorizes the local representations before representing audio-visual interactions. Extensive evaluations on a variety of datasets demonstrate the superiority of our approach in audio-event classification visual sound localization sound separation and audio-visual segmentation. These contributions enable the efficient training of deeply integrated audio-visual models and significantly advance the usefulness of early fusion architectures."},

In this paper we propose geometry-to-voxel auxiliary learning to enable voxel representations to access point-level geometric information which supports better generalisation of the voxel-based backbone with additional interpretations of multi-sensor point clouds. Specifically we construct hierarchical geometry pools generated by a voxel-guided dynamic point network which efficiently provide auxiliary fine-grained geometric information adapted to different stages of voxel features.

{"title": "DeepCache: Accelerating Diffusion Models for Free", "authors": "Xinyin Ma, Gongfan Fang, Xinchao Wang", "abstract": "Diffusion models have recently gained unprecedented attention in the field of image synthesis due to their remarkable generative capabilities. Notwithstanding their prowess these models often incur substantial computational costs primarily attributed to the sequential denoising process and cumbersome model size. Traditional methods for compressing diffusion models typically involve extensive retraining presenting cost and feasibility challenges. In this paper we introduce DeepCache a novel training-free paradigm that accelerates diffusion models from the perspective of model architecture. DeepCache capitalizes on the inherent temporal redundancy observed in the sequential denoising steps of diffusion models which caches and retrieves features across adjacent denoising stages thereby curtailing redundant computations. Utilizing the property of the U-Net we reuse the high-level features while updating the low-level features in a very cheap way. This innovative strategy in turn enables a speedup factor of 2.3xfor Stable Diffusion v1.5 with only a 0.05 decline in CLIP Score and 4.1xfor LDM-4-G with a slight decrease of 0.22 in FID on ImageNet. Our experiments also demonstrate DeepCache's superiority over existing pruning and distillation methods that necessitate retraining and its compatibility with current sampling techniques. Furthermore we find that under the same throughput DeepCache effectively achieves comparable or even marginally improved results with DDIM or PLMS."},

However due to a large gap between vision and text they might not be able to sufficiently utilize the benefits of cross-modality information. In the field of human action recognition the additional pose modality may bridge the gap between vision and text to improve the effectiveness of cross-modality learning. In this paper we propose a novel framework called the Pose-enhanced Vision-Language (PeVL) model to adapt the VL model with pose modality to learn effective knowledge of fine-grained human actions. Our PeVL model includes two novel components: an Unsymmetrical Cross-Modality Refinement (UCMR) block and a Semantic-Guided Multi-level Contrastive (SGMC) module. The UCMR block includes Pose-guided Visual Refinement (P2V-R) and Visual-enriched Pose Refinement (V2P-R) for effective cross-modality learning. The SGMC module includes Multi-level Contrastive Associations of vision-text and pose-text at both action and sub-action levels and a Semantic-Guided Loss enabling effective contrastive learning with text. Built upon a pre-trained VL foundation model our model integrates trainable adapters and can be trained end-to-end.

Our framework generalizes Picard iterations a classical algorithm for parallel sampling an ODE path and can account for non-ODE paths such as momentum-based gradient updates and changes in dimensions during the optimization process as in many cases of 3D generation.

The primary reason is that the in-batch mixing manner fails to address class imbalance. Furthermore existing LTSSL methods mainly focus on re-balancing data quantity but ignore class-wise uncertainty which is also vital for class balance. For instance some classes with sufficient samples might still exhibit high uncertainty due to indistinguishable features. To this end this paper introduces the Balanced and Entropy-based Mix (BEM) a pioneering mixing approach to re-balance the class distribution of both data quantity and uncertainty. Specifically we first propose a class balanced mix bank to store data of each class for mixing. This bank samples data based on the estimated quantity distribution thus re-balancing data quantity. Then we present an entropy-based learning approach to re-balance class-wise uncertainty including entropy-based sampling strategy entropy-based selection module and entropy-based class balanced loss. Our BEM first leverages data mixing for improving LTSSL and it can also serve as a complement to the existing re-balancing methods. Experimental results show that BEM significantly enhances various LTSSL frameworks and achieves state-of-the-art performances across multiple benchmarks."},

Moreover previous efforts often study this task from the perspective of the whole human body neglecting fine-grained guidance hidden in different body parts. To this end we present a new Fine-Grained Prompt-Driven Denoiser based on a diffusion model for 3D HPE named FinePOSE. It consists of three core blocks enhancing the reverse process of the diffusion model: (1) Fine-grained Part-aware Prompt learning (FPP) block constructs fine-grained part-aware prompts via coupling accessible texts and naturally feasible knowledge of body parts with learnable prompts to model implicit guidance. (2) Fine-grained Prompt-pose Communication (FPC) block establishes fine-grained communications between learned part-aware prompts and poses to improve the denoising quality. (3) Prompt-driven Timestamp Stylization (PTS) block integrates learned prompt embedding and temporal information related to the noise level to enable adaptive adjustment at each denoising step. Extensive experiments on public single-human pose estimation datasets show that FinePOSE outperforms state-of-the-art methods. We further extend FinePOSE to multi-human pose estimation.

Conventional vision-based methods heavily rely on matching ground-view image features with a pre-recorded image database often through establishing planar homography correspondences via a planar ground assumption. As such they tend to ignore features that are off-ground and not suited for handling visual occlusions leading to unreliable localization in challenging scenarios. We propose a Top-to-Ground Aggregation module that capitalizes aerial orthographic views to aggregate features down to the ground level leveraging reliable off-ground information to improve feature alignment. Furthermore we introduce a Cycle Domain Adaptation loss that ensures feature extraction robustness across domain changes. Additionally an Equidistant Re-projection loss is introduced to equalize the impact of all keypoints on orientation error leading to a more extended distribution of keypoints which benefits orientation estimation. On both KITTI and Ford Multi-AV datasets our method consistently achieves the lowest mean longitudinal and lateral translations across different settings and obtains the smallest orientation error when the initial pose is less accurate a more challenging setting. Further it can complete an entire route through continual vehicle pose estimation with initial vehicle pose given only at the starting point."},

The proposed method is independent of training data and noise distribution. Guided by illumination we integrate denoising and enhancing processes seamlessly enabling end-to-end training. Pairs of downsampled images are extracted from a single original low-light image and processed to preliminarily reduce noise. Based on the smoothness of illumination near-authentic illumination can be estimated from the denoised low-light image. Specifically the illumination is constrained by the denoised image's brightness uniformly amplifying pixels to raise overall brightness to normal-light level. We simultaneously restrict the illumination by scaling each pixel of the denoised image based on its intensity controlling the enhancement amplitude for different pixels. Applying the illumination to the original low-light image yields an adaptively enhanced reflection. This prevents under-enhancement and localized overexposure. Notably we concatenate the reflection with the illumination preserving their computational relationship to ultimately remove noise from the original low-light image in the form of reflection. This provides sufficient image information for the denoising procedure without changing the noise characteristics. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our method outperforms other state-of-the-art methods. The source code is available at https://github.com/Doyle59217/ZeroIG."},

Unfortunately the evaluation process could consume a significant amount of computational resources making the required periodic evaluation of model performance (e.g. monitoring training progress) impractical. Therefore we seek to improve the evaluation efficiency by selecting the representative subset of the text-image dataset. We systematically investigate the design choices including the selection criteria (textural features or imagebased metrics) and the selection granularity (prompt-level or set-level). We find that the insights from prior work on subset selection for training data do not generalize to this problem and we propose FlashEval an iterative search algorithm tailored to evaluation data selection.

One of the main sources of distribution shift for image classification is the compositional nature of images. Specifically in addition to the main object or component(s) determining the label some other image components usually exist which may lead to the shift of input distribution between train and test environments. More importantly these components may have spurious correlations with the label. To address this issue we propose Decompose-and-Compose (DaC) which improves robustness to correlation shift by a compositional approach based on combining elements of images. Based on our observations models trained with ERM usually highly attend to either the causal components or the components having a high spurious correlation with the label (especially in datapoints on which models have a high confidence). In fact according to the amount of spurious correlation and the easiness of classification based on the causal or non-causal components the model usually attends to one of these more (on samples with high confidence). Following this we first try to identify the causal components of images using class activation maps of models trained with ERM. Afterward we intervene on images by combining them and retraining the model on the augmented data including the counterfactual ones. This work proposes a group-balancing method by intervening on images without requiring group labels or information regarding the spurious features during training. The method has an overall better worst group accuracy compared to previous methods with the same amount of supervision on the group labels in correlation shift.

Addressing these challenges we introduce Monkey to enhance LMM capabilities. Firstly Monkey processes input images by dividing them into uniform patches each matching the size (e.g. 448x448) used in the original training of the well-trained vision encoder. Equipped with individual adapter for each patch Monkey can handle higher resolutions up to 1344x896 pixels enabling the detailed capture of complex visual information. Secondly it employs a multi-level description generation method enriching the context for scene-object associations. This two-part strategy ensures more effective learning from generated data: the higher resolution allows for a more detailed capture of visuals which in turn enhances the effectiveness of comprehensive descriptions. Extensive ablative results validate the effectiveness of our designs.

In this work we argue that the knowledge bias between instances and contexts affects the capability of the prototype to sufficiently understand instance semantics. Inspired by prototype learning theory we propose leveraging prototype awareness to capture diverse and fine-grained feature attributes of instances. The hypothesis is that contextual prototypes might erroneously activate similar and frequently co-occurring object categories due to this knowledge bias. Therefore we propose to enhance the prototype representation ability by mitigating the bias to better capture spatial coverage in semantic object regions. With this goal we present a Context Prototype-Aware Learning (CPAL) strategy which leverages semantic context to enrich instance comprehension. The core of this method is to accurately capture intra-class variations in object features through context-aware prototypes facilitating the adaptation to the semantic attributes of various instances. We design feature distribution alignment to optimize prototype awareness aligning instance feature distributions with dense features. In addition a unified training framework is proposed to combine label-guided classification supervision and prototypes-guided self-supervision.

While attention control has proven effective for image editing with pre-trained image generation models there are currently no large-scale video generation models publicly available.

Specifically we propose to first tune a Text-to-Set (T2S) model to complete an approximate inversion and then optimize a shared unconditional embedding to achieve accurate video inversion with a small memory cost. We further prove that it is crucial for consistent video editing. For attention control we introduce a novel decoupled-guidance strategy which uses different guidance strategies for the source and target prompts. The optimized unconditional embedding for the source prompt improves reconstruction ability while an initialized unconditional embedding for the target prompt enhances editability. Incorporating the attention maps of these two branches enables detailed editing. These technical designs enable various text-driven editing applications including word swap prompt refinement and attention re-weighting.

In this paper we propose a multi-attribute aware Transformer for 3D visual grounding learning the multi-attribute interactions to refine the intra-modal and inter-modal grounding cues. Specifically we first develop an attribute causal analysis module to quantify the causal effect of different attributes for the final prediction which provides powerful supervision to correct the misleading attributes and adaptively capture other discriminative features. Then we design an exchanging-based multimodal fusion module which dynamically replaces tokens with low attribute attention between modalities before directly integrating low-dimensional global features.

Although able to manipulate similar shaped garments in a certain task previous works mostly have to design different policies for different tasks could not generalize to garments with diverse geometries and often rely heavily on human-annotated data. In this paper we leverage the property that garments in a certain category have similar structures and then learn the topological dense (point-level) visual correspondence among garments in the category level with different deformations in the self-supervised manner. The topological correspondence can be easily adapted to the functional correspondence to guide the manipulation policies for various downstream tasks within only one or few-shot demonstrations.

We discovered that the generated facial videos suffer from the temporal distinctiveness in the temporal changes of style latent vectors which are inevitable during the generation of temporally stable videos with various facial expressions and geometric transformations. Our framework utilizes the StyleGRU module trained by contrastive learning to represent the dynamic properties of style latent vectors. Additionally we introduce a style attention module that integrates StyleGRU-generated features with content-based features enabling the detection of visual and temporal artifacts. We demonstrate our approach across various benchmark scenarios in deepfake detection showing its superiority in cross-dataset and cross-manipulation scenarios. Through further analysis we also validate the importance of using temporal changes of style latent vectors to improve the generality of deepfake video detection."},

Adversarial training has been recognized as one of the most effective methods to counter such attacks. However existing adversarial training techniques have predominantly been evaluated on balanced datasets whereas real-world data often exhibit a long-tailed distribution casting doubt on the efficacy of these methods in practical scenarios. In this paper we delve into the performance of adversarial training under long-tailed distributions. Through an analysis of the prior method \"RoBal\" (Wu et al. CVPR'21) we discover that utilizing Balanced Softmax Loss (BSL) alone can obtain comparable performance to the complete RoBal approach while significantly reducing the training overhead. Then we reveal that adversarial training under long-tailed distributions also suffers from robust overfitting similar to uniform distributions. We explore utilizing data augmentation to mitigate this issue and unexpectedly discover that unlike results obtained with balanced data data augmentation not only effectively alleviates robust overfitting but also significantly improves robustness. We further identify that the improvement is attributed to the increased diversity of training data. Extensive experiments further corroborate that data augmentation alone can significantly improve robustness. Finally building on these findings we demonstrate that compared to RoBal the combination of BSL and data augmentation leads to a +6.66% improvement in model robustness under AutoAttack on CIFAR-10-LT.

The rationale behind our approach is the elimination of textual constraints during the few-shot learning process. To that end we implement two optimization strategies. The first prompt-free conditional learning utilizes a prompt-free encoder derived from a pre-trained Stable Diffusion model. This strategy is designed to adapt new conditions to the diffusion process by minimizing the textual-visual correlation thereby ensuring a more precise alignment between the generated content and the specified conditions. The second strategy entails condition-specific negative rectification which addresses the inconsistencies typically brought about by Classifier-free guidance in few-shot training contexts.

However without specific optimization for unimodal scenarios its performance in single-modality feature extraction might be suboptimal. Despite this some studies have directly used CLIP's image encoder for tasks like few-shot classification introducing a misalignment between its pre-training objectives and feature extraction methods. This inconsistency can diminish the quality of the image's feature representation adversely affecting CLIP's effectiveness in target tasks. In this paper we view text features as precise neighbors of image features in CLIP's space and present a novel CrOss-moDal nEighbor Representation (CODER) based on the distance structure between images and their neighbor texts. This feature extraction method aligns better with CLIP's pre-training objectives thereby fully leveraging CLIP's robust cross-modal capabilities. The key to construct a high-quality CODER lies in how to create a vast amount of high-quality and diverse texts to match with images. We introduce the Auto Text Generator (ATG) to automatically produce the required text in a data-free and training-free manner.

For this purpose we explore the feasibility of probing a large language model for geography-based object knowledge and we examine the effects of integrating knowledge into zero-shot and learnable soft prompting with CLIP. Within this exploration we propose geography knowledge regularization to ensure that soft prompts trained on a source set of geographies generalize to an unseen target set. Accuracy gains over prompting baselines on DollarStreet while training only on Europe data are up to +2.8/1.2/1.6 on target data from Africa/Asia/Americas and +4.6 overall on the hardest classes.

To address this problem a unified framework including the multi-pyramid transformer (MPT) and extended frequency contrastive regularization (EFCR) is proposed to tackle two outstanding challenges in microscopy deblur: longer attention span and data deficiency. The MPT employs an explicit pyramid structure at each network stage that integrates the cross-scale window attention (CSWA) the intra-scale channel attention (ISCA) and the feature-enhancing feed-forward network (FEFN) to capture long-range cross-scale spatial interaction and global channel context. The EFCR addresses the data deficiency problem by exploring latent deblur signals from different frequency bands.

However relying on naive semantics such as class names introduces biases due to their brevity while acquiring extensive semantics from external knowledge takes a huge time and effort. This limitation severely constrains the potential of semantics in Few-Shot Learning. In this paper we design an automatic way called Semantic Evolution to generate high-quality semantics. The incorporation of high-quality semantics alleviates the need for complex network structures and learning algorithms used in previous works. Hence we employ a simple two-layer network termed Semantic Alignment Network to transform semantics and visual features into robust class prototypes with rich discriminative features for few-shot classification. The experimental results show our framework outperforms all previous methods on six benchmarks demonstrating a simple network with high-quality semantics can beat intricate multi-modal modules on few-shot classification tasks.

{"title": "Revisiting Sampson Approximations for Geometric Estimation Problems", "authors": "Felix Rydell, Angélica Torres, Viktor Larsson", "abstract": "Many problems in computer vision can be formulated as geometric estimation problems i.e. given a collection of measurements (e.g. point correspondences) we wish to fit a model (e.g. an essential matrix) that agrees with our observations. This necessitates some measure of how much an observation \"agrees\" with a given model. A natural choice is to consider the smallest perturbation that makes the observation exactly satisfy the constraints. However for many problems this metric is expensive or otherwise intractable to compute. The so-called Sampson error approximates this geometric error through a linearization scheme. For epipolar geometry the Sampson error is a popular choice and in practice known to yield very tight approximations of the corresponding geometric residual (the reprojection error). In this paper we revisit the Sampson approximation and provide new theoretical insights as to why and when this approximation works as well as provide explicit bounds on the tightness under some mild assumptions. Our theoretical results are validated in several experiments on real data and in the context of different geometric estimation tasks."},

The key insight is to lift multi-view inconsistent 2D segmentations into a consistent 3D feature field through a hierarchical contrastive learning framework which is accomplished by two steps. Firstly we design a novel hierarchical representation based on category-agnostic 2D segmentations to model the multi-level relationship among pixels. Secondly image features rendered from the 3D feature field are clustered at different levels which can be further drawn closer or pushed apart according to the hierarchical relationship between different levels. In tackling the challenges posed by inconsistent 2D segmentations this framework yields a global consistent 3D feature field which further enables hierarchical segmentation multi-object selection and global discretization. Extensive experiments demonstrate the effectiveness of our method on high-quality 3D segmentation and accurate hierarchical structure understanding.

This paper proposes a novel method for UID named Orthogonal Decoupling Contrastive Regularization (ODCR). Our method is grounded in the assumption that an image consists of both haze-related features which influence the degree of haze and haze-unrelated features such as texture and semantic information. ODCR aims to ensure that the haze-related features of the dehazing result closely resemble those of the clear image while the haze-unrelated features align with the input hazy image. To accomplish the motivation Orthogonal MLPs optimized geometrically on the Stiefel manifold are proposed which can project image features into an orthogonal space thereby reducing the relevance between different features. Furthermore a task-driven Depth-wise Feature Classifier (DWFC) is proposed which assigns weights to the orthogonal features based on the contribution of each channel's feature in predicting whether the feature source is hazy or clear in a self-supervised fashion. Finally a Weighted PatchNCE (WPNCE) loss is introduced to achieve the pulling of haze-related features in the output image toward those of clear images while bringing haze-unrelated features close to those of the hazy input.

Predicting a 3D scene from text description(s) is similarly ill-posed i.e. spatial arrangements of objects described. We investigate the question of whether two inherently ambiguous modalities can be used in conjunction to produce metric-scaled reconstructions. To test this we focus on monocular depth estimation the problem of predicting a dense depth map from a single image but with an additional text caption describing the scene. To this end we begin by encoding the text caption as a mean and standard deviation; using a variational framework we learn the distribution of the plausible metric reconstructions of 3D scenes corresponding to the text captions as a prior. To \"select\" a specific reconstruction or depth map we encode the given image through a conditional sampler that samples from the latent space of the variational text encoder which is then decoded to the output depth map. Our approach is trained alternatingly between the text and image branches: in one optimization step we predict the mean and standard deviation from the text description and sample from a standard Gaussian and in the other we sample using a (image) conditional sampler. Once trained we directly predict depth from the encoded text using the conditional sampler.

To make MVPS more accessible we introduce a practical and easy-to-implement setup multi-view constrained photometric stereo (MVCPS) where the light directions are unknown but constrained to move together with the camera. Unlike conventional multi-view uncalibrated photometric stereo our constrained setting reduces the ambiguities of surface normal estimates from per-view linear ambiguities to a single and global linear one thereby simplifying the disambiguation process. The proposed method integrates the ambiguous surface normal into neural surface reconstruction (NeuS) to simultaneously resolve the global ambiguity and estimate the detailed 3D shape.

We call the aggregate of these contribution maps the Implicit Neural Canvas and we use this concept to demonstrate that the INRs we study learn to \"see\" the frames they represent in surprising ways. For example INRs tend to have highly distributed representations. While lacking high-level object semantics they have a significant bias for color and edges and are almost entirely space-agnostic. We arrive at our conclusions by examining how objects are represented across time in video INRs using clustering to visualize similar neurons across layers and architectures and show that this is dominated by motion. These insights demonstrate the general usefulness of our analysis framework."},

Existing adversarially robust FSL methods rely on either visual similarity learning or class concept learning. Our analysis reveals that these two learning paradigms are complementary exhibiting distinct robustness due to their unique decision boundary types (concepts clustering by the visual similarity label vs. classification by the class labels). To bridge this gap we propose a novel framework unifying adversarially robust similarity learning and class concept learning. Specifically we distill parameters from both network branches into a \"unified embedding model\" during robust optimization and redistribute them to individual network branches periodically. To capture generalizable robustness across diverse branches we initialize adversaries in each episode with cross-branch class-wise \"global adversarial perturbations\" instead of less informative random initialization. We also propose a branch robustness harmonization to modulate the optimization of similarity and class concept learners via their relative adversarial robustness. Extensive experiments demonstrate the state-of-the-art performance of our method in diverse few-shot scenarios."},

Despite advancements current methods easily suffer the distractors or heavy object appearance variations in videos due to insufficient object information from the text leading to degradation. Addressing this we propose a novel framework context-guided STVG (CG-STVG) which mines discriminative instance context for object in videos and applies it as a supplementary guidance for target localization. The key of CG-STVG lies in two specially designed modules including instance context generation (ICG) which focuses on discovering visual context information (in both appearance and motion) of the instance and instance context refinement (ICR) which aims to improve the instance context from ICG by eliminating irrelevant or even harmful information from the context. During grounding ICG together with ICR are deployed at each decoding stage of a Transformer architecture for instance context learning. Particularly instance context learned from one decoding stage is fed to the next stage and leveraged as a guidance containing rich and discriminative object feature to enhance the target-awareness in decoding feature which conversely benefits generating better new instance context for improving localization finally. Compared to existing methods CG-STVG enjoys object information in text query and guidance from mined instance visual context for more accurate target localization. In our experiments on three benchmarks including HCSTVG-v1/-v2 and VidSTG CG-STVG sets new state-of-the-arts in m_tIoU and m_vIoU on all of them showing efficacy.

Recent results suggest that heuristic-based clustering methods in conjunction with object trackers can be used to pseudo-label instances of moving objects and use these as supervisory signals to train 3D object detectors in Lidar data without manual supervision. We re-think this approach and suggest that both object detection as well as motion-inspired pseudo-labeling can be tackled in a data-driven manner. We leverage recent advances in scene flow estimation to obtain point trajectories from which we extract long-term class-agnostic motion patterns. Revisiting correlation clustering in the context of message passing networks we learn to group those motion patterns to cluster points to object instances. By estimating the full extent of the objects we obtain per-scan 3D bounding boxes that we use to supervise a Lidar object detection network. Our method not only outperforms prior heuristic-based approaches (57.5 AP +14 improvement over prior work) more importantly we show we can pseudo-label and train object detectors across datasets."},

Through the lens of the formulation we find that the crux of TBIE is that existing techniques hardly achieve a good trade-off between editability and fidelity mainly due to the overfitting of the single-image fine-tuning. To this end we propose a Doubly Abductive Counterfactual inference framework (DAC). We first parameterize an exogenous variable as a UNet LoRA whose abduction can encode all the image details. Second we abduct another exogenous variable parameterized by a text encoder LoRA which recovers the lost editability caused by the overfitted first abduction. Thanks to the second abduction which exclusively encodes the visual transition from post-edit to pre-edit its inversion---subtracting the LoRA---effectively reverts pre-edit back to post-edit thereby accomplishing the edit. Through extensive experiments our DAC achieves a good trade-off between editability and fidelity. Thus we can support a wide spectrum of user editing intents including addition removal manipulation replacement style transfer and facial change which are extensively validated in both qualitative and quantitative evaluations.

GROUNDHOG incorporates a masked feature extractor and converts extracted features into visual entity tokens for the MLLM backbone which then connects groundable phrases to unified grounding masks by retrieving and merging the entity masks. To train GROUNDHOG we carefully curated M3G2 a grounded visual instruction tuning dataset with Multi-Modal Multi-Grained Grounding by harvesting a collection of segmentation-grounded datasets with rich annotations.

To bridge the gap this work proposes a simple and effective probabilistic model ensemble framework based on Gaussian processes which have previously demonstrated remarkable efficacy in processing small data. We achieve the integration of prior knowledge by specifying the mean function with CLIP and the kernel function with an ensemble of deep kernels built upon various pre-trained models. By regressing the classification label directly our framework enables analytical inference straightforward uncertainty quantification and principled hyper-parameter tuning. Through extensive experiments on standard benchmarks we demonstrate that our method consistently outperforms competitive ensemble baselines regarding predictive performance. Additionally we assess the robustness of our method and the quality of the yielded uncertainty estimates on out-of-distribution datasets. We also illustrate that our method despite relying on label regression still enjoys superior model calibration compared to most deterministic baselines."},

Test-time adaptation (TTA) algorithms have been proposed to adapt the model online while inferring test data. However existing research predominantly focuses on classification tasks through the optimization of batch normalization layers or classification heads but this approach limits its applicability to various model architectures like Transformers and makes it challenging to apply to other tasks such as object detection. In this paper we propose a novel online adaption approach for object detection in continually changing test domains considering which part of the model to update how to update it and when to perform the update. By introducing architecture-agnostic and lightweight adaptor modules and only updating these while leaving the pre-trained backbone unchanged we can rapidly adapt to new test domains in an efficient way and prevent catastrophic forgetting. Furthermore we present a practical and straightforward class-wise feature aligning method for object detection to resolve domain shifts. Additionally we enhance efficiency by determining when the model is sufficiently adapted or when additional adaptation is needed due to changes in the test distribution.

To address this we propose MotionEditor the first diffusion model for video motion editing. MotionEditor incorporates a novel content-aware motion adapter into ControlNet to capture temporal motion correspondence. While ControlNet enables direct generation based on skeleton poses it encounters challenges when modifying the source motion in the inverted noise due to contradictory signals between the noise (source) and the condition (reference). Our adapter complements ControlNet by involving source content to transfer adapted control signals seamlessly. Further we build up a two-branch architecture (a reconstruction branch and an editing branch) with a high-fidelity attention injection mechanism facilitating branch interaction. This mechanism enables the editing branch to query the key and value from the reconstruction branch in a decoupled manner making the editing branch retain the original background and protagonist appearance. We also propose a skeleton alignment algorithm to address the discrepancies in pose size and position. Experiments demonstrate the promising motion editing ability of MotionEditor both qualitatively and quantitatively. To the best of our knowledge MotionEditor is the first to use diffusion models specifically for video motion editing considering the origin dynamic background and camera movement."},

To address this limitation we present S-DyRF a reference-based spatio-temporal stylization method for dynamic neural radiance fields. However stylizing dynamic 3D scenes is inherently challenging due to the limited availability of stylized reference images along the temporal axis. Our key insight lies in introducing additional temporal cues besides the provided reference. To this end we generate temporal pseudo-references from the given stylized reference. These pseudo-references facilitate the propagation of style information from the reference to the entire dynamic 3D scene. For coarse style transfer we enforce novel views and times to mimic the style details present in pseudo-references at the feature level. To preserve high-frequency details we create a collection of stylized temporal pseudo-rays from temporal pseudo-references. These pseudo-rays serve as detailed and explicit stylization guidance for achieving fine style transfer. Experiments on both synthetic and real-world datasets demonstrate that our method yields plausible stylized results of space-time view synthesis on dynamic 3D scenes."},

The objective is to make the two decoupled tasks assist each other and eventually improve the action anticipation task. Specifically we propose a two-stream Transformer-based architecture which is composed of a verb-to-noun model and a noun-to-verb model. The verb-to-noun model leverages the verb information to improve the noun prediction and the other way around. We extend the model in a probabilistic manner and quantify the predictive uncertainty of each decoupled task to select features. In this way the noun prediction leverages the most informative and redundancy-free verb features and verb prediction works similarly. Finally the two streams are combined dynamically based on their uncertainties to make the joint action anticipation.

In this paper we propose a novel robustness enhancement framework by first learning the concept of the co-salient objects based on the input group images and then leveraging this concept to purify adversarial perturbations which are subsequently fed to CoSODs for robustness enhancement. Specifically we propose CosalPure containing two modules i.e. group-image concept learning and concept-guided diffusion purification. For the first module we adopt a pre-trained text-to-image diffusion model to learn the concept of co-salient objects within group images where the learned concept is robust to adversarial examples. For the second module we map the adversarial image to the latent space and then perform diffusion generation by embedding the learned concept into the noise prediction function as an extra condition. Our method can effectively alleviate the influence of the SOTA adversarial attack containing different adversarial patterns including exposure and noise. The extensive results demonstrate that our method could enhance the robustness of CoSODs significantly."},

The majority of recent research on adversarial robustness however has predominantly focused on CNNs. In this work we bridge this gap by analyzing the effectiveness of existing attacks on VITs. We demonstrate that due to the softmax computations in every attention block in VITs they are inherently vulnerable to floating point underflow errors. This can lead to a gradient masking effect resulting in suboptimal attack strength of well-known attacks like PGD Carlini and Wagner (CW) GAMA and Patch attacks. Motivated by this we propose Adaptive Attention Scaling (AAS) attack that can automatically find the optimal scaling factors of pre-softmax outputs using gradient-based optimization. We show that the proposed simple strategy can be incorporated with any existing adversarial attacks as well as adversarial training methods and achieved improved performance. On VIT-B16 we demonstrate an improved attack strength of upto 2.2% on CIFAR10 and upto 2.9% on CIFAR100 by incorporating the proposed AAS attack with state-of-the-art single attack methods like GAMA attack. Further we utilise the proposed AAS attack for every few epochs in existing adversarial training methods which is termed as Adaptive Attention Scaling Adversarial Training (AAS-AT).

Current methods predominantly rely on labeled domain-specific video datasets which limits cross-domain generalization of learned similarity embeddings. We propose MASA a novel method for robust instance association learning capable of matching any objects within videos across diverse domains without tracking labels. Leveraging the rich object segmentation from the Segment Anything Model (SAM) MASA learns instance-level correspondence through exhausive data transformations. We treat the SAM outputs as dense object region proposals and learn to match those regions from a vast image collection. We further design a universal MASA adapter which can work in tandem with foundational segmentation or detection models and enable them to track any detected objects. Those combinations present strong zero-shot tracking ability in complex domains. Extensive tests on multiple challenging MOT and MOTS benchmarks indicate that the proposed method using only unlabelled static images achieves even better performance than state-of-the-art methods trained with fully annotated in-domain video sequences in zero-shot association.

But it remains inadequate for underwater scenes primarily due to data scarcity. Given the inherent challenges of light attenuation and backscatter in water acquiring clear underwater images or precise depth is notably difficult and costly. To mitigate this issue learning-based approaches often rely on synthetic data or turn to self- or unsupervised manners. Nonetheless their performance is often hindered by domain gap and looser constraints. In this paper we propose a novel pipeline for generating photorealistic underwater images using accurate terrestrial depth. This approach facilitates the supervised training of models for underwater depth estimation effectively reducing the performance disparity between terrestrial and underwater environments. Contrary to previous synthetic datasets that merely apply style transfer to terrestrial images without scene content change our approach uniquely creates vivid non-existent underwater scenes by leveraging terrestrial depth data through the innovative Stable Diffusion model. Specifically we introduce a specialized Depth2Underwater ControlNet trained on prepared \\ Underwater Depth Text\\  data triplets for this generation task. Our newly developed dataset Atlantis enables terrestrial depth estimation models to achieve considerable improvements on unseen underwater scenes surpassing their terrestrial pretrained counterparts both quantitatively and qualitatively. Moreover we further show its practical utility by applying the improved depth in underwater image enhancement and its smaller domain gap from the LLVM perspective.

Gary Chan", "abstract": "Due to its promising results density map regression has been widely employed for image-based crowd counting. The approach however often suffers from severe performance degradation when tested on data from unseen scenarios the so-called \"domain shift\" problem. To address the problem we investigate in this work single domain generalization (SDG) for crowd counting. The existing SDG approaches are mainly for image classification and segmentation and can hardly be extended to our case due to its regression nature and label ambiguity (i.e. ambiguous pixel-level ground truths). We propose MPCount a novel effective SDG approach even for narrow source distribution. MPCount stores diverse density values for density map regression and reconstructs domain-invariant features by means of only one memory bank a content error mask and attention consistency loss. By partitioning the image into grids it employs patch-wise classification as an auxiliary task to mitigate label ambiguity. Through extensive experiments on different datasets MPCount is shown to significantly improve counting accuracy compared to the state of the art under diverse scenarios unobserved in the training data characterized by narrow source distribution.

These methodologies reveal the difference among networks in terms of two properties called compositionality and disjunctivism. Transformers and ConvNeXt are found to be more compositional in the sense that they jointly consider multiple parts of the image in building their decisions whereas traditional CNNs and distilled transformers are less compositional and more disjunctive which means that they use multiple diverse but smaller set of parts to achieve a confident prediction. Through further experiments we pinpointed the choice of normalization to be especially important in the compositionality of a model in that batch normalization leads to less compositionality while group and layer normalization lead to more. Finally we also analyze the features shared by different backbones and plot a landscape of different models based on their feature-use similarity."},

To help resolve this ambiguous problem we introduce a new framework to combine rich contextual information provided by scenes to benefit full-body motion tracking from sparse observations. To estimate plausible human motions given sparse tracking signals and 3D scenes we develop \\text S ^2Fusion a unified framework fusing \\underline S cene and sparse \\underline S ignals with a conditional dif\\underline Fusion  model. \\text S ^2Fusion first extracts the spatial-temporal relations residing in the sparse signals via a periodic autoencoder and then produces time-alignment feature embedding as additional inputs. Subsequently by drawing initial noisy motion from a pre-trained prior \\text S ^2Fusion utilizes conditional diffusion to fuse scene geometry and sparse tracking signals to generate full-body scene-aware motions. The sampling procedure of \\text S ^2Fusion is further guided by a specially designed scene-penetration loss and phase-matching loss which effectively regularizes the motion of the lower body even in the absence of any tracking signals making the generated motion much more plausible and coherent.

Most modern methods adhere to the paradigm of learning vision-language space from a large-scale multi-modal corpus and subsequently transferring the acquired knowledge to off-the-shelf detectors like Faster-RCNN. However information attenuation or destruction may occur during the process of knowledge transfer due to the domain gap hampering the generalization ability on novel categories. To mitigate this predicament in this paper we present a novel framework named BIND standing for Bulit-IN Detector to eliminate the need for module replacement or knowledge transfer to off-the-shelf detectors. Specifically we design a two-stage training framework with an Encoder-Decoder structure. In the first stage an image-text dual encoder is trained to learn region-word alignment from a corpus of image-text pairs. In the second stage a DETR-style decoder is trained to perform detection on annotated object detection datasets. In contrast to conventional manually designed non-adaptive anchors which generate numerous redundant proposals we develop an anchor proposal network that generates anchor proposals with high likelihood based on candidates adaptively thereby substantially improving detection efficiency. Experimental results on two public benchmarks COCO and LVIS demonstrate that our method stands as a state-of-the-art approach for open-vocabulary object detection."},

To address this gap in this paper we propose a novel motion-aware robust communication network (MRCNet) that mitigates noise interference and achieves accurate and robust collaborative perception. MRCNet consists of two main components: multi-scale robust fusion (MRF) addresses pose noise by developing cross-semantic multi-scale enhanced aggregation to fuse features of different scales while motion enhanced mechanism (MEM) captures motion context to compensate for information blurring caused by moving objects. Experimental results on popular collaborative 3D object detection datasets demonstrate that MRCNet outperforms competing methods in noisy scenarios with improved perception performance using less bandwidth."},

Although many methods have achieved promising results their robustness has not been thoroughly studied. In practice we observe that temporal information in videos can be occasionally corrupted such as missing or blurred frames. Interestingly existing methods often incur a significant performance drop even if only one frame is affected. To formally evaluate the robustness we establish two temporal corruption robustness benchmarks namely THUMOS14-C and ActivityNet-v1.3-C. In this paper we extensively analyze the robustness of seven leading TAD methods and obtain some interesting findings: 1) Existing methods are particularly vulnerable to temporal corruptions and end-to-end methods are often more susceptible than those with a pre-trained feature extractor; 2) Vulnerability mainly comes from localization error rather than classification error; 3) When corruptions occur in the middle of an action instance TAD models tend to yield the largest performance drop. Besides building a benchmark we further develop a simple but effective robust training method to defend against temporal corruptions through the FrameDrop augmentation and Temporal-Robust Consistency loss. Remarkably our approach not only improves robustness but also yields promising improvements on clean data. We believe that this study will serve as a benchmark for future research in robust video analysis.

Dominant schemes include controlling the complexity of the field function with regularization or smoothing the field with local filters but the former suffers from heavy computational burden and the latter fails to accommodate discontinuities in the case of large scene disparities. In this paper inspired by Fourier expansion we propose a novel network called DeMatch which decomposes the motion field to retain its main \"low-frequency\" and smooth part. This achieves implicit regularization with lower computational cost and generates piecewise smoothness naturally. Specifically we first decompose the rough motion field that is contaminated by false matches into several different sub-fields which are highly smooth and contain the main energy of the original field. Then with these smooth sub-fields we recover a cleaner motion field from which correct motion vectors are subsequently derived. We also design a special masked decomposition strategy to further mitigate the negative influence of false matches. All the mentioned processes are finally implemented in a discrete and learnable manner avoiding the difficulty of calculating real dense fields. Extensive experiments reveal that DeMatch outperforms state-of-the-art methods in multiple tasks and shows promising low computational usage and piecewise smoothness property.

To this end we explore video-first architectures building on the common paradigm of transferring large-scale image--text models to video via shallow temporal fusion. However we expose two limitations to the approach: (1) decreased spatial capabilities likely due to poor video--language alignment in standard video datasets and (2) higher memory consumption bottlenecking the number of frames that can be processed. To mitigate the memory bottleneck we systematically analyze the memory/accuracy trade-off of various efficient methods: factorized attention parameter-efficient image-to-video adaptation input masking and multi-resolution patchification. Surprisingly simply masking large portions of the video (up to 75%) during contrastive pre-training proves to be one of the most robust ways to scale encoders to videos up to 4.3 minutes at 1 FPS.

Thus we propose a metric tensor-based consistency regularization exploiting the class-variant geometrical structure of embeddings on the high-dimensional feature space. The proposed method not only minimizes the prediction discrepancy between different views of a given image but also estimates the intrinsic geometric curvature of embedding spaces by employing the global and local metric tensors. The global metric tensor is used to globally estimate the class-invariant embeddings from the whole data distribution while the local metric tensor is exploited to estimate the class-variant embeddings of each cluster. The two metric tensors are optimized by the consistency regularization based on the weak and strong augmentation strategy.

However noise in real-world scenarios is often spatially correlated which causes many self-supervised algorithms that assume pixel-wise independent noise to perform poorly. Recent works have attempted to break noise correlation with downsampling or neighborhood masking. However denoising on downsampled subgraphs can lead to aliasing effects and loss of details due to a lower sampling rate. Furthermore the neighborhood masking methods either come with high computational complexity or do not consider local spatial preservation during inference. Through the analysis of existing methods we point out that the key to obtaining high-quality and texture-rich results in real-world self-supervised denoising tasks is to train at the original input resolution structure and use asymmetric operations during training and inference. Based on this we propose Asymmetric Tunable Blind-Spot Network (AT-BSN) where the blind-spot size can be freely adjusted thus better balancing noise correlation suppression and image local spatial destruction during training and inference. In addition we regard the pre-trained AT-BSN as a meta-teacher network capable of generating various teacher networks by sampling different blind-spots. We propose a blind-spot based multi-teacher distillation strategy to distill a lightweight network significantly improving performance.

One of the key reasons is that current methods intertwine spatial content and temporal dynamics together leading to a notably increased complexity of text-to-video generation (T2V). In this work we propose HiGen a diffusion model-based method that improves performance by decoupling the spatial and temporal factors of videos from two perspectives i.e. structure level and content level. At the structure level we decompose the T2V task into two steps including spatial reasoning and temporal reasoning using a unified denoiser. Specifically we generate spatially coherent priors using text during spatial reasoning and then generate temporally coherent motions from these priors during temporal reasoning. At the content level we extract two subtle cues from the content of the input video that can express motion and appearance changes respectively. These two cues then guide the model's training for generating videos enabling flexible content variations and enhancing temporal stability. Through the decoupled paradigm HiGen can effectively reduce the complexity of this task and generate realistic videos with semantics accuracy and motion stability. Extensive experiments demonstrate the superior performance of HiGen over the state-of-the-art T2V methods. We have released our source code and models."},

A major challenge of CIL arises when applying to real-world data characterized by non-uniform distribution which introduces a dual imbalance problem involving (i) disparities between stored exemplars of old tasks and new class data (inter-phase imbalance) and (ii) severe class imbalances within each individual task (intra-phase imbalance). We show that this dual imbalance issue causes skewed gradient updates with biased weights in FC layers thus inducing over/under-fitting and catastrophic forgetting in CIL. Our method addresses it by reweighting the gradients towards balanced optimization and unbiased classifier learning. Additionally we observe imbalanced forgetting where paradoxically the instance-rich classes suffer higher performance degradation during CIL due to a larger amount of training data becoming unavailable in subsequent learning phases. To tackle this we further introduce a distribution-aware knowledge distillation loss to mitigate forgetting by aligning output logits proportionally with the distribution of lost training data.

To enable multi-view generation we repurpose a pretrained 2D diffusion model by extending its self-attention layers with cross-view interactions and fine-tune it on a high quality subset of Objaverse. We find that a naive extension of the self-attention proposed in prior work (e.g. MVDream) leads to content copying between views. Therefore we explicitly constrain the cross-view attention based on epipolar geometry. To further enhance 3D consistency we utilize Pl ?ucker coordinates derived from camera rays and inject them as positional encoding. This enables SPAD to reason over spatial proximity in 3D well. Compared to concurrent works that can only generate views at fixed azimuth and elevation (e.g. MVDream SyncDreamer) SPAD offers full camera control and achieves state-of-the-art results in novel view synthesis on unseen objects from the Objaverse and Google Scanned Objects datasets. Finally we demonstrate that text-to-3D generation using SPAD prevents the multi-face Janus issue."},

However existing methods focus on the human appearance reconstruction of every single frame while the temporal motion relations are not fully explored. In this paper we propose a new 4D motion modeling paradigm SurMo that jointly models the temporal dynamics and human appearances in a unified framework with three key designs: 1) Surface-based motion encoding that models 4D human motions with an efficient compact surface-based triplane. It encodes both spatial and temporal motion relations on the dense surface manifold of a statistical body template which inherits body topology priors for generalizable novel view synthesis with sparse training observations. 2) Physical motion decoding that is designed to encourage physical motion learning by decoding the motion triplane features at timestep t to predict both spatial derivatives and temporal derivatives at the next timestep t+1 in the training stage. 3) 4D appearance decoding that renders the motion triplanes into images by an efficient volumetric surface-conditioned renderer that focuses on the rendering of body surfaces with motion learning conditioning. Extensive experiments validate the state-of-the-art performance of our new paradigm and illustrate the expressiveness of surface-based motion triplanes for rendering high-fidelity view-consistent humans with fast motions and even motion-dependent shadows.

Limited by the inherent ambiguity of Class Activation Map (CAM) we observe that one-stage pipelines often encounter confirmation bias caused by incorrect CAM pseudo-labels impairing their final segmentation performance. Although recent works discard many unreliable pseudo-labels to implicitly alleviate this issue they fail to exploit sufficient supervision for their models. To this end we propose a dual student framework with trustworthy progressive learning (DuPL). Specifically we propose a dual student network with a discrepancy loss to yield diverse CAMs for each sub-net. The two sub-nets generate supervision for each other mitigating the confirmation bias caused by learning their own incorrect pseudo-labels. In this process we progressively introduce more trustworthy pseudo-labels to be involved in the supervision through dynamic threshold adjustment with an adaptive noise filtering strategy. Moreover we believe that every pixel even discarded from supervision due to its unreliability is important for WSSS. Thus we develop consistency regularization on these discarded regions providing supervision of every pixel. Experiment results demonstrate the superiority of the proposed DuPL over the recent state-of-the-art alternatives on PASCAL VOC 2012 and MS COCO datasets.

To reduce labeling costs for large-scale datasets semi-automated and crowdsourcing labeling methods are developed but their labels are inevitably noisy. Learning with Noisy Labels (LNL) approaches aim to train DNNs despite the presence of noisy labels. These approaches utilize the memorization effect to select correct labels and refine noisy ones which are then used for subsequent training. However these methods encounter a significant decrease in the model's generalization performance due to the inevitably existing noise labels. To overcome this limitation we propose a new approach to enhance learning with noisy labels by incorporating additional distribution information--structural labels. In order to leverage additional distribution information for generalization we employ a reverse k-NN which helps the model in achieving a better feature manifold and mitigating overfitting to noisy labels. The proposed method shows outperformed performance in multiple benchmark datasets with IDN and real-world noisy datasets."},

Most previous approaches either train neural networks to directly regress motion in 3D or learn data-driven motion priors and combine them with optimization at test time. RoHM is a novel diffusion-based motion model that conditioned on noisy and occluded input data reconstructs complete plausible motions in consistent global coordinates. Given the complexity of the problem -- requiring one to address different tasks (denoising and infilling) in different solution spaces (local and global motion) -- we decompose it into two sub-tasks and learn two models one for global trajectory and one for local motion. To capture the correlations between the two we then introduce a novel conditioning module combining it with an iterative inference scheme. We apply RoHM to a variety of tasks -- from motion reconstruction and denoising to spatial and temporal infilling. Extensive experiments on three popular datasets show that our method outperforms state-of-the-art approaches qualitatively and quantitatively while being faster at test time.

To address this limitation we generatively refine the newly generated local views by querying and aggregating global 3D information and then progressively generate the 3D scene. Specifically we employ a tri-plane features-based NeRF as a unified representation of the 3D scene to constrain global 3D consistency and propose a generative refinement network to synthesize new contents with higher quality by exploiting the natural image prior from 2D diffusion model as well as the global 3D information of the current scene.

In this paper we analyze the bottlenecks exist in contrastive learning-based methods and offer a fresh perspective on inter-pixel correlations to construct more safe and effective supervision signals which is in line with the nature of semantic segmentation. To this end we develop a coherent RankMatch network including the construction of representative agents to model inter-pixel correlation beyond regular individual pixel-wise consistency and further unlock the potential of agents by modeling inter-agent relationships in pursuit of rank-aware correlation consistency.

Unlike prior approaches that rely on pre-defined category-specific 3D templates or tailored 3D skeletons SAOR learns to articulate shapes from single-view image collections with a skeleton-free part-based model without requiring any 3D object shape priors. To prevent ill-posed solutions we propose a cross-instance consistency loss that exploits disentangled object shape deformation and articulation. This is helped by a new silhouette-based sampling mechanism to enhance viewpoint diversity during training. Our method only requires estimated object silhouettes and relative depth maps from off-the-shelf pre-trained networks during training. At inference time given a single-view image it efficiently outputs an explicit mesh representation. We obtain improved qualitative and quantitative results on challenging quadruped animals compared to relevant existing work."},

Next we prove that intrinsic image decomposition for Lambertian scenes becomes a well-posed problem if one has access to the absorbed light. Our theory generalizes to arbitrary shapes and unstructured illumination. Our theory is based on applying energy conservation principle at each pixel independently.

This is a challenging problem due to two primary reasons. Firstly objects in urban aerial images exhibit substantial variations in size including buildings cars and roads which pose a significant challenge for accurate 2D segmentation. Secondly the 2D labels generated by existing segmentation methods suffer from the multi-view inconsistency problem especially in the case of aerial images where each image captures only a small portion of the entire scene. To overcome these limitations we first introduce a scale-adaptive semantic label fusion strategy that enhances the segmentation of objects of varying sizes by combining labels predicted from different altitudes harnessing the novel-view synthesis capabilities of NeRF. We then introduce a novel cross-view instance label grouping strategy based on the 3D scene representation to mitigate the multi-view inconsistency problem in the 2D instance labels. Furthermore we exploit multi-view reconstructed depth priors to improve the geometric quality of the reconstructed radiance field resulting in enhanced segmentation results.

These objectives often compete so optimizing both can lead to a trade-off between utility and fairness. While existing works acknowledge the trade-offs and study their limits two questions remain unanswered: 1) What are the optimal tradeoffs between utility and fairness? and 2) How can we numerically quantify these trade-offs from data for a desired prediction task and demographic attribute of interest? This paper addresses these questions. We introduce two utility-fairness trade-offs: the Data-Space and Label-Space Trade-off. The trade-offs reveal three regions within the utility-fairness plane delineating what is fully and partially possible and impossible. We propose U-FaTE a method to numerically quantify the trade-offs for a given prediction task and group fairness definition from data samples. Based on the trade-offs we introduce a new scheme for evaluating representations. An extensive evaluation of fair representation learning methods and representations from over 1000 pre-trained models revealed that most current approaches are far from the estimated and achievable fairness-utility trade-offs across multiple datasets and prediction tasks."},

In this work we propose DPLOT a simple yet effective TTA framework that consists of two components: (1) domain-specific block selection and (2) pseudo-label generation using paired-view images. Specifically we select blocks that involve domain-specific feature extraction and train these blocks by entropy minimization. After blocks are adjusted for current test domain we generate pseudo-labels by averaging given test images and corresponding flipped counterparts. By simply using flip augmentation we prevent a decrease in the quality of the pseudo-labels which can be caused by the domain gap resulting from strong augmentation.

Within this family of methods absolute pose regression (APR) has recently shown promising accuracy in the range of a few centimeters in position error. APR networks encode the scene geometry implicitly in their weights. To achieve high accuracy they require vast amounts of training data that realistically can only be created using novel view synthesis in a days-long process. This process has to be repeated for each new scene again and again. We present a new approach to pose regression map-relative pose regression (marepo) that satisfies the data hunger of the pose regression network in a scene-agnostic fashion. We condition the pose regressor on a scene-specific map representation such that its pose predictions are relative to the scene map. This allows us to train the pose regressor across hundreds of scenes to learn the generic relation between a scene-specific map representation and the camera pose. Our map-relative pose regressor can be applied to new map representations immediately or after mere minutes of fine-tuning for the highest accuracy.

Inspired by the success of DETR in object detection several methods have adapted the query-based framework to the TAD task.

To address this issue we propose a new Dual-level query-based TAD framework namely DualDETR to detect actions from both instance-level and boundary-level. Decoding at different levels requires semantics of different granularity therefore we introduce a two-branch decoding structure. This structure builds distinctive decoding processes for different levels facilitating explicit capture of temporal cues and semantics at each level. On top of the two-branch design we present a joint query initialization strategy to align queries from both levels. Specifically we leverage encoder proposals to match queries from each level in a one-to-one manner. Then the matched queries are initialized using position and content prior from the matched action proposal. The aligned dual-level queries can refine the matched proposal with complementary cues during subsequent decoding. We evaluate DualDETR on three challenging multi-label TAD benchmarks.

Moreover prior work suggests that compositionality doesn't arise with scale: larger model sizes or training data don't help. This paper develops a new iterated training algorithm that incentivizes compositionality. We draw on decades of cognitive science research that identifies cultural transmission--the need to teach a new generation--as a necessary inductive prior that incentivizes humans to develop compositional languages. Specifically we reframe vision-language contrastive learning as the Lewis Signaling Game between a vision agent and a language agent and operationalize cultural transmission by iteratively resetting one of the agent's weights during training.

Recent Diffusion Models (DMs) have been introduced in HDR imaging field demonstrating promising performance particularly in achieving visually perceptible results compared to previous DNN-based methods. However DMs require extensive iterations with large models to estimate entire images resulting in inefficiency that hinders their practical application. To address this challenge we propose the Low-Frequency aware Diffusion (LF-Diff) model for ghost-free HDR imaging. The key idea of LF-Diff is implementing the DMs in a highly compacted latent space and integrating it into a regression-based model to enhance the details of reconstructed images. Specifically as low-frequency information is closely related to human visual perception we propose to utilize DMs to create compact low-frequency priors for the reconstruction process. In addition to take full advantage of the above low-frequency priors the Dynamic HDR Reconstruction Network (DHRNet) is carried out in a regression-based manner to obtain final HDR images. Extensive experiments conducted on synthetic and real-world benchmark datasets demonstrate that our LF-Diff performs favorably against several state-of-the-art methods and is 10x faster than previous DM-based methods."},

Kim", "abstract": "We present a method to reconstruct indoor and outdoor static scene geometry and appearance from an omnidirectional video moving in a small circular sweep. This setting is challenging because of the small baseline and large depth ranges making it difficult to find ray crossings. To better constrain the optimization we estimate geometry as a signed distance field within a spherical binoctree data structure and use a complementary efficient tree traversal strategy based on a breadth-first search for sampling. Unlike regular grids or trees the shape of this structure well-matches the camera setting creating a better memory-quality trade-off. From an initial depth estimate the binoctree is adaptively subdivided throughout the optimization; previous methods use a fixed depth that leaves the scene undersampled. In comparison with three neural optimization methods and two non-neural methods ours shows decreased geometry error on average especially in a detailed scene while significantly reducing the required number of voxels to represent such details."},

To imitate the performance of the original dataset most approaches employ bi-level optimization and the distillation space relies on the matching architecture. Nevertheless these approaches either suffer significant computational costs on large-scale datasets or experience performance decline on cross-architectures. We advocate for designing an economical dataset distillation framework that is independent of the matching architectures.With empirical observations we argue that constraining the consistency of the real and synthetic image spaces will enhance the cross-architecture generalization. Motivated by this we introduce Dataset Distillation via Disentangled Diffusion Model (D^4M) an efficient framework for dataset distillation. Compared to architecture-dependent methods D^4M employs latent diffusion model to guarantee consistency and incorporates label information into category prototypes. The distilled datasets are versatile eliminating the need for repeated generation of distinct datasets for various architectures. Through comprehensive experiments D^4M demonstrates superior performance and robust generalization surpassing the SOTA methods across most aspects."},

However our investigation shows that despite these gains their potential for real-world applications is restricted by their limited generalization capabilities to novel image domains. In this paper we introduce OmniGlue the first learnable image matcher that is designed with generalization as a core principle. OmniGlue leverages broad knowledge from a vision foundation model to guide the feature matching process boosting generalization to domains not seen at training time. Additionally we propose a novel keypoint position-guided attention mechanism which disentangles spatial and appearance information leading to enhanced matching descriptors. We perform comprehensive experiments on a suite of 6 datasets with varied image domains including scene-level object-centric and aerial images. OmniGlue's novel components lead to relative gains on unseen domains of 20.9% with respect to a directly comparable reference model while also outperforming the recent LightGlue method by 9.5% relatively.

The camera poses are represented using an implicit neural function which maps the given time to the corresponding camera pose. The mapped camera poses are then used for the downstream tasks where joint camera pose optimization is also required. While doing so the network parameters - that implicitly represent camera poses - are optimized. We exploit the proposed method in four diverse experimental settings namely (1) NeRF from noisy poses; (2) NeRF from asynchronous Events; (3) Visual Simultaneous Localization and Mapping (vSLAM); and (4) vSLAM with IMUs. In all four settings the proposed method performs significantly better than the compared baselines and the state-of-the-art methods. Additionally using the assumption of continuous motion changes in pose may actually live in a manifold that has lower than 6 degrees of freedom (DOF) is also realized. We call this low DOF motion representation as the intrinsic motion and use the approach in vSLAM settings show ing impressive camera tracking performance."},

SCoFT is designed to prevent overfitting on small datasets encode only high-level information from the data and shift the generated distribution away from misrepresentations encoded in a pretrained model.

{"title": "Learning Degradation-Independent Representations for Camera ISP Pipelines", "authors": "Yanhui Guo, Fangzhou Luo, Xiaolin Wu", "abstract": "Image signal processing (ISP) pipeline plays a fundamental role in digital cameras which converts raw Bayer sensor data to RGB images. However ISP-generated images usually suffer from imperfections due to the compounded degradations that stem from sensor noises demosaicing noises compression artifacts and possibly adverse effects of erroneous ISP hyperparameter settings such as ISO and gamma values. In a general sense these ISP imperfections can be considered as degradations. The highly complex mechanisms of ISP degradations some of which are even unknown pose great challenges to the generalization capability of deep neural networks (DNN) for image restoration and to their adaptability to downstream tasks. To tackle the issues we propose a novel DNN approach to learn degradation-independent representations (DiR) through the refinement of a self-supervised learned baseline representation. The proposed DiR learning technique has remarkable domain generalization capability and consequently it outperforms state-of-the-art methods across various downstream tasks including blind image restoration object detection and instance segmentation as verified in our experiments."},

Previous studies achieve remarkable performance using learning-based feature comparison. However the pervasive presence of matching redundancy between images gives rise to unnecessary and error-prone computations in these methods imposing limitations on their accuracy. To address this issue we propose MESA a novel approach to establish precise area (or region) matches for efficient matching redundancy reduction. MESA first leverages the advanced image understanding capability of SAM a state-of-the-art foundation model for image segmentation to obtain image areas with implicit semantic. Then a multi-relational graph is proposed to model the spatial structure of these areas and construct their scale hierarchy. Based on graphical models derived from the graph the area matching is reformulated as an energy minimization task and effectively resolved. Extensive experiments demonstrate that MESA yields substantial precision improvement for multiple point matchers in indoor and outdoor downstream tasks e.g. +13.61% for DKM in indoor pose estimation."},

To bridge this gap we introduce ShapeWalk a carefully designed synthetic dataset designed to advance the field of language-guided shape editing. The dataset consists of 158K unique shapes connected through 26K edit chains with an average length of 14 chained shapes. Each consecutive pair of shapes is associated with precise language instructions describing the applied edits. We synthesize edit chains by reconstructing and interpolating shapes sampled from a realistic CAD-designed 3D dataset in the parameter space of the GeoCode shape program. We leverage rule-based methods and language models to generate accurate and realistic natural language prompts corresponding to each edit. To illustrate the practicality of our contribution we train neural editor modules in the latent space of shape autoencoders and demonstrate the ability of our dataset to enable a variety of language-guided shape edits. Finally we introduce multi-step editing metrics to benchmark the capacity of our models to perform recursive shape edits. We hope that our work will enable further study of compositional language-guided shape editing and finds application in 3D CAD design and interactive modeling."},
{"title": "Rethinking the Objectives of Vector-Quantized Tokenizers for Image Synthesis", "authors": "Yuchao Gu, Xintao Wang, Yixiao Ge, Ying Shan, Mike Zheng Shou", "abstract": "Vector-Quantized (VQ-based) generative models usually consist of two basic components i.e. VQ tokenizers and generative transformers. Prior research focuses on improving the reconstruction fidelity of VQ tokenizers but rarely examines how the improvement in reconstruction affects the generation ability of generative transformers. In this paper we find that improving the reconstruction fidelity of VQ tokenizers does not necessarily improve the generation. Instead learning to compress semantic features within VQ tokenizers significantly improves generative transformers' ability to capture textures and structures. We thus highlight two competing objectives of VQ tokenizers for image synthesis: semantic compression and details preservation. Different from previous work that prioritizes better details preservation we propose Semantic-Quantized GAN (SeQ-GAN) with two learning phases to balance the two objectives. In the first phase we propose a semantic-enhanced perceptual loss for better semantic compression. In the second phase we fix the encoder and codebook but finetune the decoder to achieve better details preservation. Our proposed SeQ-GAN significantly improves VQ-based generative models for both unconditional and conditional image generation. Specifically SeQ-GAN achieves a Frechet Inception Distance (FID) of 6.25 and Inception Score (IS) of 140.9 on 256x256 ImageNet generation a remarkable improvement over VIT-VQGAN which obtains 11.2 FID and 97.2 IS."},

Existing methods often rely on Tweedie's first-order moments that tend to induce biased results. Second-order approximations are computationally prohibitive making standard reverse diffusion processes intractable for posterior sampling. This paper presents Second-order Tweedie sampler from Surrogate Loss (STSL) a novel sampler offering efficiency comparable to first-order Tweedie while enabling tractable reverse processes using second-order approximation. Theoretical results reveal that our approach utilizing for the trace of the Hessian with only O(1) compute establishes a lower bound through a surrogate loss and enables a tractable reverse process. We show STSL outperforms SoTA solvers PSLD and P2L by reducing neural function evaluations by 4X and 8X respectively while enhancing sampling quality on FFHQ ImageNet and COCO benchmarks. Moreover STSL extends to text guided image editing and mitigates residual distortions in corrupted images.

Addressing this gap we introduce a novel open-world formulation for the video OSC problem. The goal is to temporally localize the three stages of an OSC---the object's initial state its transitioning state and its end state---whether or not the object has been observed during training. Towards this end we develop VidOSC a holistic learning approach that: (1) leverages text and vision-language models for supervisory signals to obviate manually labeling OSC training data and (2) abstracts fine-grained shared state representations from objects to enhance generalization. Furthermore we present HowToChange the first open-world benchmark for video OSC localization which offers an order of magnitude increase in the label space and annotation volume compared to the best existing benchmark. Experimental results demonstrate the efficacy of our approach in both traditional closed-world and open-world scenarios."},

The challenge of MD lies in the diverse nature of mesh facets in terms of geometric characteristics and noise distributions. Despite recent advancements in deep learning-based MD methods existing MD networks typically neglect the consideration of geometric characteristics and noise distributions. In this paper we propose Hyper-MD a hyper-network-based approach that addresses this limitation by dynamically customizing denoising parameters for each facet based on its noise intensity and geometric characteristics. Specifically Hyper-MD is composed of a hyper-network and an MD network. For each noisy facet the hyper-network takes two angles as input to customize parameters for the MD network. These two angles are specially defined to reveal the noise intensity and geometric characteristics of the current facet respectively. The MD network receives a facet patch as input and outputs the denoised normal using the customized parameters. Experimental results on synthetic and real-scanned meshes demonstrate that Hyper-MD outperforms state-of-the-art mesh denoising methods."},
{"title": "KeyPoint Relative Position Encoding for Face Recognition", "authors": "Minchul Kim, Yiyang Su, Feng Liu, Anil Jain, Xiaoming Liu", "abstract": "In this paper we address the challenge of making ViT models more robust to unseen affine transformations. Such robustness becomes useful in various recognition tasks such as face recognition when image alignment failures occur. We propose a novel method called KP-RPE which leverages key points (e.g.facial landmarks) to make ViT more resilient to scale translation and pose variations. We begin with the observation that Relative Position Encoding (RPE) is a good way to bring affine transform generalization to ViTs. RPE however can only inject the model with prior knowledge that nearby pixels are more important than far pixels. Keypoint RPE (KP-RPE) is an extension of this principle where the significance of pixels is not solely dictated by their proximity but also by their relative positions to specific keypoints within the image. By anchoring the significance of pixels around keypoints the model can more effectively retain spatial relationships even when those relationships are disrupted by affine transformations. We show the merit of KP-RPE in face and gait recognition. The experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness in improving face recognition performance from low-quality images particularly where alignment is prone to failure. Code and pre-trained models are available."},

However they struggle to handle complex scenarios with curvilinear motions since they overlook the latent acceleration information between the input frames. Moreover the supervision of predicted motions is tricky because ground-truth motions are not available. To this end we propose a novel framework for implicit quadratic video frame interpolation (IQ-VFI) which explores latent acceleration information and accurate intermediate motions via knowledge distillation. Specifically the proposed IQ-VFI consists of an implicit acceleration estimation network (IANet) and a VFI backbone the former fully leverages spatio-temporal information to explore latent acceleration priors between two input frames which is then used to progressively modulate linear motions from the latter into quadratic motions in coarse-to-fine manner. Furthermore to encourage both components to distill more acceleration and motion cues oriented towards VFI we propose a knowledge distillation strategy in which implicit acceleration distillation loss and implicit motion distillation loss are employed to adaptively guide latent acceleration priors and intermediate motions learning respectively. Extensive experiments show that our proposed IQ-VFI can achieve state-of-the-art performances on various benchmark datasets."},

The core idea of the proposed model is to generate all attributes (e.g. human body hair clothes and so on) in an overall attribute space with six feature planes which are then decomposed and manipulated with different attribute indexes. To precisely extract features of different attributes from the generated feature planes we propose a novel attribute indexing method as well as an orthogonal projection regularization to enhance the disentanglement. We also introduce a hyper-latent training strategy and an attribute-specific sampling strategy to avoid style entanglement and misleading punishment from the discriminator. Our method allows users to interactively edit selected attributes in the generated 3D human avatars while keeping others fixed. Both qualitative and quantitative experiments demonstrate that our model provides a strong disentanglement between different attributes allows fine-grained image editing and generates high-quality 3D human avatars."},

Ideally 3D backbones for lidar should be able to inherit these properties after distillation of these powerful 2D features. The most recent methods for image-to-lidar distillation on autonomous driving data show promising results obtained thanks to distillation methods that keep improving. Yet we still notice a large performance gap when measuring by linear probing the quality of distilled vs fully supervised features. In this work instead of focusing only on the distillation method we study the effect of three pillars for distillation: the 3D backbone the pretrained 2D backbone and the pretraining 2D+3D dataset. In particular thanks to our scalable distillation method named ScaLR we show that scaling the 2D and 3D backbones and pretraining on diverse datasets leads to a substantial improvement of the feature quality. This allows us to significantly reduce the gap between the quality of distilled and fully-supervised 3D features and to improve the robustness of the pretrained backbones to domain gaps and perturbations."},

Consequently AMG ensures memorization-free outputs while maintaining high image quality and text alignment leveraging the synergy of its guidance methods each indispensable in its own right. AMG also features an innovative automatic detection system for potential memorization during each step of inference process allows selective application of guidance strategies minimally interfering with the original sampling process to preserve output utility.

{"title": "T-VSL: Text-Guided Visual Sound Source Localization in Mixtures", "authors": "Tanvir Mahmud, Yapeng Tian, Diana Marculescu", "abstract": "Visual sound source localization poses a significant challenge in identifying the semantic region of each sounding source within a video. Existing self-supervised and weakly supervised source localization methods struggle to accurately distinguish the semantic regions of each sounding object particularly in multi-source mixtures. These methods often rely on audio-visual correspondence as guidance which can lead to substantial performance drops in complex multi-source localization scenarios. The lack of access to individual source sounds in multi-source mixtures during training exacerbates the difficulty of learning effective audio-visual correspondence for localization. To address this limitation in this paper we propose incorporating the text modality as an intermediate feature guide using tri-modal joint embedding models (e.g. AudioCLIP) to disentangle the semantic audio-visual source correspondence in multi-source mixtures. Our framework dubbed T-VSL begins by predicting the class of sounding entities in mixtures. Subsequently the textual representation of each sounding source is employed as guidance to disentangle fine-grained audio-visual source correspondence from multi-source mixtures leveraging the tri-modal AudioCLIP embedding. This approach enables our framework to handle a flexible number of sources and exhibits promising zero-shot transferability to unseen classes during test time. Extensive experiments conducted on the MUSIC VGGSound and VGGSound-Instruments datasets demonstrate significant performance improvements over state-of-the-art methods.

Most of these models rely on the Score Distillation Sampling (SDS) algorithm to optimize a 3D representation such that the rendered image maintains a high likelihood as evaluated by a pre-trained diffusion model. However this distillation process involves finding a correct mode in the high-dimensional and large-variance distribution produced by the diffusion model. This task is challenging and often leads to issues such as over-saturation over-smoothing and Janus-like artifacts in the 3D generation. In this paper we propose a novel learning paradigm for 3D synthesis that utilizes pre-trained diffusion models. Instead of focusing on mode-seeking our method directly models the distribution discrepancy between multi-view renderings and diffusion priors in an adversarial manner which unlocks the generation of high-fidelity and photorealistic 3D content conditioned on a single image and prompt. Moreover by harnessing the latent space of GANs and expressive diffusion model priors our method enables a wide variety of 3D applications including single-view reconstruction high diversity generation and continuous 3D interpolation in open domain.

Surprisingly via entropy analysis we find that even a few points e.g. 64 points could retain substantial information to help recover the 3D shape of the object. To address the challenge of shape completion with very sparse point clouds we then propose Few-point Shape Completion (FSC) model which contains a novel dual-branch feature extractor for handling extremely sparse inputs coupled with an extensive branch for maximal point utilization with a saliency branch for dynamic importance assignment. This model is further bolstered by a two-stage revision network that refines both the extracted features and the decoder output enhancing the detail and authenticity of the completed point cloud.

In this paper we extend the investigation of Neural Collapse to the biased datasets with imbalanced attributes. We observe that models will easily fall into the pitfall of shortcut learning and form a biased non-collapsed feature space at the early period of training which is hard to reverse and limits the generalization capability. To tackle the root cause of biased classification we follow the recent inspiration of prime training and propose an avoid-shortcut learning framework without additional training complexity. With well-designed shortcut primes based on Neural Collapse structure the models are encouraged to skip the pursuit of simple shortcuts and naturally capture the intrinsic correlations. Experimental results demonstrate that our method induces a better convergence property during training and achieves state-of-the-art generalization performance on both synthetic and real-world biased datasets."},

They operate through a two-steps process: introducing noise into training samples and then employing a model to convert random noise into new samples (e.g. images). However their remarkable generative performance is hindered by slow training and sampling. This is due to the necessity of tracking extensive forward and reverse diffusion trajectories and employing a large model with numerous parameters across multiple timesteps (i.e. noise levels). To tackle these challenges we present a multi-stage framework inspired by our empirical findings. These observations indicate the advantages of employing distinct parameters tailored to each timestep while retaining universal parameters shared across all time steps. Our approach involves segmenting the time interval into multiple stages where we employ custom multi-decoder U-net architecture that blends time-dependent models with a universally shared encoder. Our framework enables the efficient distribution of computational resources and mitigates inter-stage interference which substantially improves training efficiency. Extensive numerical experiments affirm the effectiveness of our framework showcasing significant training and sampling efficiency enhancements on three state-of-the-art diffusion models including large-scale latent diffusion models.

However reconstructing these strands from observed surface images of hair presents significant challenges. The difficulty in acquiring Ground Truth (GT) data has led state-of-the-art learning-based methods to rely on pre-training with manually prepared synthetic CG data. This process is not only labor-intensive and costly but also introduces complications due to the domain gap when compared to real-world data. In this study we propose an optimization-based approach that eliminates the need for pre-training. Our method represents hair strands as line segments growing from the scalp and optimizes them using a novel differentiable rendering algorithm. To robustly optimize a substantial number of slender explicit geometries we introduce 3D orientation estimation utilizing global optimization strand initialization based on Laplace's equation and reparameterization that leverages geometric connectivity and spatial proximity.

However incorporating multiple LUTs for improved performance comes at the cost of a rapidly growing storage size which is ultimately restricted by the allocatable on-device cache size. In this work we propose a novel LUT compression framework to achieve a better trade-off between storage size and performance for LUT-based image restoration models. Based on the observation that most cached LQ image patches are distributed along the diagonal of a LUT we devise a Diagonal-First Compression (DFC) framework where diagonal LQ-HQ pairs are preserved and carefully re-indexed to maintain the representation capacity while non-diagonal pairs are aggressively subsampled to save storage. Extensive experiments on representative image restoration tasks demonstrate that our DFC framework significantly reduces the storage size of LUT-based models (including our new design) while maintaining their performance. For instance DFC saves up to 90% of storage at a negligible performance drop for x4 super-resolution. The source code is available on GitHub: https://github.com/leenas233/DFC."},

While some works rely on additional data such as 2D real-world images and their corresponding camera poses recent studies target at using point cloud exclusively by designing 3D-to-2D projection. However in the indoor scene scenario existing 3D-to-2D projection strategies suffer from severe occlusions and incoherence which fail to contain sufficient information for fine-grained point cloud segmentation task. In this paper we argue that the crux of the matter resides in the basic premise of existing projection strategies that the medium is homogeneous thereby projection rays propagate along straight lines and behind objects are occluded by front ones. Inspired by the phenomenon of mirage where the occluded objects are exposed by distorted light rays due to heterogeneous medium refraction rate we propose MirageRoom by designing parametric mirage projection with heterogeneous medium to obtain series of projected images with various distorted degrees. We further develop a masked reprojection module across 2D and 3D latent space to bridge the gap between pre-trained 2D backbone and 3D point-wise features.

The text expression normally contains sophisticated description of the instance's appearance action and relation with others. It is therefore rather difficult for a RVOS model to capture all these attributes correspondingly in the video; in fact the model often favours more on the action- and relation-related visual attributes of the instance. This can end up with partial or even incorrect mask prediction of the target instance. We tackle this problem by taking a subject-centric short text expression from the original long text expression. The short one retains only the appearance-related information of the target instance so that we can use it to focus the model's attention on the instance's appearance. We let the model make joint predictions using both long and short text expressions; and insert a long-short cross-attention module to interact the joint features and a long-short predictions intersection loss to regulate the joint predictions. Besides the improvement on the linguistic part we also introduce a forward-backward visual consistency loss which utilizes optical flows to warp visual features between the annotated frames and their temporal neighbors for consistency.

Another line of work that focuses on pixel-level tasks often encounters a large annotation gap of things and stuff and suffers from mutual interference between foreground-object and background-class segmentation. In stark contrast to the prevailing methods we present APE a universal visual perception model for aligning and prompting everything all at once in an image to perform diverse tasks i.e. detection segmentation and grounding as an instance-level sentence-object matching paradigm. Specifically APE advances the convergence of detection and grounding by reformulating language-guided grounding as open-vocabulary detection which efficiently scales up model prompting to thousands of category vocabularies and region descriptions while maintaining the effectiveness of cross-modality fusion. To bridge the granularity gap of different pixel-level tasks APE equalizes semantic and panoptic segmentation to proxy instance learning by considering any isolated regions as individual instances. APE aligns vision and language representation on broad data with natural and challenging characteristics all at once without task-specific fine-tuning. The extensive experiments on over 160 datasets demonstrate that with only one-suit of weights APE outperforms (or is on par with) the state-of-the-art models proving that an effective yet universal perception for anything aligning and prompting is indeed feasible.

Despite the significant progress made in recent methods the requirement of dense textual descriptions for each individual object which is time-consuming and costly hinders their scalability. To mitigate reliance on text annotations during training researchers have explored language-free training paradigms in the 2D field via explicit text generation or implicit feature substitution. Nevertheless unlike 2D images the complexity of spatial relations in 3D coupled with the absence of robust 3D visual language pre-trained models makes it challenging to directly transfer previous strategies. To tackle the above issues in this paper we introduce a language-free training framework for 3D visual grounding.

Smooth latent spaces ensure that a perturbation on an input latent corresponds to a steady change in the output image. This property proves beneficial in downstream tasks including image interpolation inversion and editing. In this work we expose the non-smoothness of diffusion latent spaces by observing noticeable visual fluctuations resulting from minor latent variations. To tackle this issue we propose Smooth Diffusion a new category of diffusion models that can be simultaneously high-performing and smooth.

In addition we devise an interpolation standard deviation (ISTD) metric to effectively assess the latent space smoothness of a diffusion model. Extensive quantitative and qualitative experiments demonstrate that Smooth Diffusion stands out as a more desirable solution not only in T2I generation but also across various downstream tasks.

This paper uncovers that certain dense features extracted from the frozen ResNet image encoder of CLIP exhibit distortion-invariant and content-related properties which are highly desirable for generalizable denoising. Leveraging these properties we devise an asymmetrical encoder-decoder denoising network which incorporates dense features including the noisy image and its multi-scale features from the frozen ResNet encoder of CLIP into a learnable image decoder to achieve generalizable denoising. The progressive feature augmentation strategy is further proposed to mitigate feature overfitting and improve the robustness of the learnable decoder. Extensive experiments and comparisons conducted across diverse OOD noises including synthetic noise real-world sRGB noise and low-dose CT image noise demonstrate the superior generalization ability of our method."},
{"title": "Selectively Informative Description can Reduce Undesired Embedding Entanglements in Text-to-Image Personalization", "authors": "Jimyeong Kim, Jungwon Park, Wonjong Rhee", "abstract": "In text-to-image personalization a timely and crucial challenge is the tendency of generated images overfitting to the biases present in the reference images. We initiate our study with a comprehensive categorization of the biases into background nearby-object tied-object substance (in style re-contextualization) and pose biases. These biases manifest in the generated images due to their entanglement into the subject embedding. This undesired embedding entanglement not only results in the reflection of biases from the reference images into the generated images but also notably diminishes the alignment of the generated images with the given generation prompt. To address this challenge we propose SID (Selectively Informative Description) a text description strategy that deviates from the prevalent approach of only characterizing the subject's class identification. SID is generated utilizing multimodal GPT-4 and can be seamlessly integrated into optimization-based models. We present comprehensive experimental results along with analyses of cross-attention maps subject-alignment non-subject-disentanglement and text-alignment."},

Equivariant networks further extend this property to other transformation groups. However most existing methods require discretization or sampling of groups leading to increased model sizes for larger groups such as the affine group. In this paper we build affine equivariant networks based on differential invariants from the viewpoint of symmetric PDEs without discretizing or sampling the group. To address the division-by-zero issue arising from fractional differential invariants of the affine group we construct a new kind of affine invariants by normalizing polynomial relative differential invariants to replace classical differential invariants. For further flexibility we design an equivariant layer which can be directly integrated into convolutional networks of various architectures. Moreover our framework for the affine group is also applicable to its continuous subgroups. We implement equivariant networks for the scale group the rotation-scale group and the affine group. Numerical experiments demonstrate the outstanding performance of our framework across classification tasks involving transformations of these groups. Remarkably under the out-of-distribution setting our model achieves a 3.37% improvement in accuracy over the main counterpart affConv on the affNIST dataset."},

However these resultant images usually contain both real sources and artifacts due to signal sparsity and other factors. One way to obtain cleaner images is to reconstruct samples into dense forms before imaging. Unfortunately existing reconstruction methods often miss some components of visibility in frequency domain so blurred object edges and persistent artifacts remain in the images. Furthermore the computation overhead is high on irregular visibility samples due to the data skew. To address these problems we propose PolarRec a transformer-encoder-conditioned reconstruction pipeline with visibility samples converted into the polar coordinate system. This coordinate system matches the way in which radio telescopes observe a celestial area as the Earth rotates. As a result visibility samples distribute in the polar system more uniformly than in the Cartesian space. Therefore we propose to use radial distance in the loss function to help reconstruct complete visibility effectively. Also we group visibility samples by their polar angles and propose a group-based encoding scheme to improve the efficiency. Our experiments demonstrate that PolarRec markedly improves imaging results by faithfully reconstructing all frequency components in the visibility domain while significantly reducing the computation cost in visibility data encoding.

We present Open3DSG an alternative approach to learn 3D scene graph prediction in an open world without requiring labeled scene graph data. We co-embed the features from a 3D scene graph prediction backbone with the feature space of powerful open world 2D vision language foundation models. This enables us to predict 3D scene graphs from 3D point clouds in a zero-shot manner by querying object classes from an open vocabulary and predicting the inter-object relationships from a grounded LLM with scene graph features and queried object classes as context. Open3DSG is the first 3D point cloud method to predict not only explicit open-vocabulary object classes but also open-set relationships that are not limited to a predefined label set making it possible to express rare as well as specific objects and relationships in the predicted 3D scene graph. Our experiments show that Open3DSG is effective at predicting arbitrary object classes as well as their complex inter-object relationships describing spatial supportive semantic and comparative relationships."},

To tackle this challenge we introduce Image-Conditioned Caption Correction (ICCC) a novel pre-training task designed to enhance VLMs' zero-shot performance without the need for labeled task-aware data. The ICCC task compels VLMs to rectify mismatches between visual and language concepts thereby enhancing instruction following and text generation conditioned on visual inputs.

Most existing work utilizes a tailored cross-attention mechanism to perform local alignment across the two image and text modalities. This is computationally expensive even though it is more powerful than the unimodal dual-encoder approach. This work introduces a dual-encoder image-text matching model leveraging a scene graph to represent captions with nodes for objects and attributes interconnected by relational edges. Utilizing a graph attention network our model efficiently encodes object-attribute and object-object semantic relations resulting in a robust and fast-performing system. Representing caption as a scene graph offers the ability to utilize the strong relational inductive bias of graph neural networks to learn object-attribute and object-object relations effectively. To train the model we propose losses that align the image and caption both at the holistic level (image-caption) and the local level (image-object entity) which we show is key to the success of the model. Our model is termed Composition model for Object Relations and Attributes CORA. Experimental results on two prominent image-text retrieval benchmarks Flickr30K and MS-COCO demonstrate that CORA outperforms existing state-of-the-art computationally expensive cross-attention methods regarding recall score while achieving fast computation speed of the dual encoder.

Therefore event cameras are widely applied in diverse computer vision applications where event-based keypoint detection is a fundamental task. However achieving robust event-based keypoint detection remains challenging because the ground truth of event keypoints is difficult to obtain descriptors extracted by CNN usually lack discriminative ability in the presence of intense noise and fixed keypoint detectors are limited in detecting varied keypoint patterns. To address these challenges a novel event-based keypoint detection method is proposed by learning dynamic detectors and contextual descriptors in a self-supervised manner (SD2Event) including a contextual feature descriptor learning (CFDL) module and a dynamic keypoint detector learning (DKDL) module. The proposed SD2Event enjoys several merits. First the proposed CFDL module can model long-range contexts efficiently and effectively. Second the DKDL module generates dynamic keypoint detectors which can detect keypoints with diverse patterns across various event streams. Third the proposed self-supervised signals can guide the model's adaptation to event data.

In this paper we argue that relying solely on aligning label-level semantics and global skeleton features is insufficient to effectively transfer locally consistent visual knowledge from seen to unseen classes. To address this limitation we introduce Part-aware Unified Representation between Language and Skeleton (PURLS) to explore visual-semantic alignment at both local and global scales. PURLS introduces a new prompting module and a novel partitioning module to generate aligned textual and visual representations across different levels. The former leverages a pre-trained GPT-3 to infer refined descriptions of the global and local (body-part-based and temporal-interval-based) movements from the original action labels. The latter employs an adaptive sampling strategy to group visual features from all body joint movements that are semantically relevant to a given description. Our approach is evaluated on various skeleton/language backbones and three large-scale datasets i.e. NTU-RGB+D 60 NTU-RGB+D 120 and a newly curated dataset Kinetics-skeleton 200.

However existing N:M sparsity methods do not differentiate the relative importance of weights among blocks and leave important weights underappreciated. Besides they directly apply N:M sparsity to the whole network which will cause severe information loss. Thus they are still sub-optimal. In this paper we propose an efficient and effective Multi-Axis Query methodology dubbed as MaxQ to rectify these problems. During the training MaxQ employs a dynamic approach to generate soft N:M masks considering the weight importance across multiple axes. This method enhances the weights with more importance and ensures more effective updates. Meanwhile a sparsity strategy that gradually increases the percentage of N:M weight blocks is applied which allows the network to heal from the pruning-induced damage progressively. During the runtime the N:M soft masks can be precomputed as constants and folded into weights without causing any distortion to the sparse pattern and incurring additional computational overhead. Comprehensive experiments demonstrate that MaxQ achieves consistent improvements across diverse CNN architectures in various computer vision tasks including image classification object detection and instance segmentation. For ResNet50 with 1:16 sparse pattern MaxQ can achieve 74.6% top-1 accuracy on ImageNet and improve by over 2.8% over the state-of-the-art.

Instead these methods directly output animations from speech without control over the expressed emotion. To address this limitation we present AMUSE an emotional speech-driven body animation model based on latent diffusion. Our observation is that content (i.e. gestures related to speech rhythm and word utterances) emotion and personal style are separable. To account for this AMUSE maps the driving audio to three disentangled latent vectors: one for content one for emotion and one for personal style. A latent diffusion model trained to generate gesture motion sequences is then conditioned on these latent vectors. Once trained AMUSE synthesizes 3D human gestures directly from speech with control over the expressed emotions and style by combining the content from the driving speech with the emotion and style of another speech sequence. Randomly sampling the noise of the diffusion model further generates variations of the gesture with the same emotional expressivity. Qualitative quantitative and perceptual evaluations demonstrate that AMUSE outputs realistic gesture sequences. Compared to the state of the art the generated gestures are better synchronized with the speech content and better represent the emotion expressed by the input speech.

In legal doctrine however determining the degree of similarity between works requires subjective analysis and fact-finders (judges and juries) can demonstrate considerable variability in these subjective judgement calls. Images that are structurally similar can be deemed dissimilar whereas images of completely different scenes can be deemed similar enough to support a claim of copying. We seek to define and compute a notion of \"conceptual similarity\" among images that captures high-level relations even among images that do not share repeated elements or visually similar components. The idea is to use a base multi-modal model to generate \"explanations\" (captions) of visual data at increasing levels of complexity. Then similarity can be measured by the length of the caption needed to discriminate between the two images: Two highly dissimilar images can be discriminated early in their description whereas conceptually dissimilar ones will need more detail to be distinguished. We operationalize this definition and show that it correlates with subjective (averaged human evaluation) assessment and beats existing baselines on both image-to-image and text-to-text similarity benchmarks. Beyond just providing a number our method also offers interpretability by pointing to the specific level of granularity of the description where the source data is differentiated."},

Semi-supervised learning and self-supervised learning are two different research directions that can improve accuracy by learning from extra unlabeled data. Recent methods from both directions have reported significant gains on traditional benchmarks. Yet past benchmarks do not focus on medical tasks and rarely compare self- and semi- methods together on an equal footing. Furthermore past benchmarks often handle hyperparameter tuning suboptimally. First they may not tune hyperparameters at all leading to underfitting. Second when tuning does occur it often unrealistically uses a labeled validation set that is much larger than the training set. Therefore currently published rankings might not always corroborate with their practical utility This study contributes a systematic evaluation of self- and semi- methods with a unified experimental protocol intended to guide a practitioner with scarce overall labeled data and a limited compute budget. We answer two key questions: Can hyperparameter tuning be effective with realistic-sized validation sets? If so when all methods are tuned well which self- or semi-supervised methods achieve the best accuracy? Our study compares 13 representative semi- and self-supervised methods to strong labeled-set-only baselines on 4 medical datasets.

Prior methods directly model the motion field from the Eulerian perspective by Representation Learning that separates shape and texture or Multi-domain Learning from phase fluctuations.

To this end we present FD4MM a new paradigm of Frequency Decoupling for Motion Magnification with a Multi-level Isomorphic Architecture to capture multi-level high-frequency details and a stable low-frequency structure (motion field) in video space. Since high-frequency details and subtle motions are susceptible to information degradation due to their inherent subtlety and unavoidable external interference from noise we carefully design Sparse High/Low-pass Filters to enhance the integrity of details and motion structures and a Sparse Frequency Mixer to promote seamless recoupling. Besides we innovatively design a contrastive regularization for this task to strengthen the model's ability to discriminate irrelevant features reducing undesired motion magnification. Extensive experiments on both Real-world and Synthetic Datasets show that our FD4MM outperforms SOTA methods.

Kot, Bihan Wen", "abstract": "While super-resolution (SR) methods based on diffusion models exhibit promising results their practical application is hindered by the substantial number of required inference steps. Recent methods utilize the degraded images in the initial state thereby shortening the Markov chain. Nevertheless these solutions either rely on a precise formulation of the degradation process or still necessitate a relatively lengthy generation path (e.g. 15 iterations). To enhance inference speed we propose a simple yet effective method for achieving single-step SR generation named SinSR. Specifically we first derive a deterministic sampling process from the most recent state-of-the-art (SOTA) method for accelerating diffusion-based SR. This allows the mapping between the input random noise and the generated high-resolution image to be obtained in a reduced and acceptable number of inference steps during training. We show that this deterministic mapping can be distilled into a student model that performs SR within only one inference step. Additionally we propose a novel consistency-preserving loss to simultaneously leverage the ground-truth image during the distillation process ensuring that the performance of the student model is not solely bound by the feature manifold of the teacher model resulting in further performance improvement. Extensive experiments conducted on synthetic and real-world datasets demonstrate that the proposed method can achieve comparable or even superior performance compared to both previous SOTA methods and the teacher model in just one sampling step resulting in a remarkable up to x10 speedup for inference. Our code will be released at https://github.com/wyf0912/SinSR/."},

We initially investigate the key contributions of the U-Net architecture to the denoising process and identify that its main backbone primarily contributes to denoising whereas its skip connections mainly introduce high-frequency features into the decoder module causing the potential neglect of crucial functions intrinsic to the backbone network. Capitalizing on this discovery we propose a simple yet effective method termed \"FreeU\" which enhances generation quality without additional training or finetuning. Our key insight is to strategically re-weight the contributions sourced from the U-Net's skip connections and backbone feature maps to leverage the strengths of both components of the U-Net architecture. Promising results on image and video generation tasks demonstrate that our FreeU can be readily integrated to existing diffusion models e.g. Stable Diffusion DreamBooth and ControlNet to improve the generation quality with only a few lines of code. All you need is to adjust two scaling factors during inference."},

However operating on dense latent spaces introduces a cubic time and space complexity which limits scalability in terms of perception range or spatial resolution. Existing approaches compress the dense representation using projections like Bird's Eye View (BEV) or Tri-Perspective View (TPV). Although efficient these projections result in information loss especially for tasks like semantic occupancy prediction. To address this we propose SparseOcc an efficient occupancy network inspired by sparse point cloud processing. It utilizes a lossless sparse latent representation with three key innovations. Firstly a 3D sparse diffuser performs latent completion using spatially decomposed 3D sparse convolutional kernels. Secondly a feature pyramid and sparse interpolation enhance scales with information from others. Finally the transformer head is redesigned as a sparse variant. SparseOcc achieves a remarkable 74.9% reduction on FLOPs over the dense baseline. Interestingly it also improves accuracy from 12.8% to 14.1% mIOU which in part can be attributed to the sparse representation's ability to avoid hallucinations on empty voxels."},

Generating fine-grained pseudo-labels based on weak-label and then self-training a classifier is currently a promising solution. However since the existing methods use only RGB visual modality and the utilization of category text information is neglected thus limiting the generation of more accurate pseudo-labels and affecting the performance of self-training. Inspired by the manual labeling process based on the event description in this paper we propose a novel pseudo-label generation and self-training framework based on Text Prompt with Normality Guidance (TPWNG) for WSVAD. Our idea is to transfer the rich language-visual knowledge of the contrastive language-image pre-training (CLIP) model for aligning the video event description text and corresponding video frames to generate pseudo-labels. Specifically We first fine-tune the CLIP for domain adaptation by designing two ranking losses and a distributional inconsistency loss. Further we propose a learnable text prompt mechanism with the assist of a normality visual prompt to further improve the matching accuracy of video event description text and video frames. Then we design a pseudo-label generation module based on the normality guidance to infer reliable frame-level pseudo-labels. Finally we introduce a temporal context self-adaptive learning module to learn the temporal dependencies of different video events more flexibly and accurately.

However existing methods struggle to reconstruct faces with extreme expressions due to deficiencies in supervisory signals such as sparse or inaccurate landmarks. Segmentation information contains effective geometric contexts for face reconstruction. Certain attempts intuitively depend on differentiable renderers to compare the rendered silhouettes of reconstruction with segmentation which is prone to issues like local optima and gradient instability. In this paper we fully utilize the facial part segmentation geometry by introducing Part Re-projection Distance Loss (PRDL). Specifically PRDL transforms facial part segmentation into 2D points and re-projects the reconstruction onto the image plane. Subsequently by introducing grid anchors and computing different statistical distances from these anchors to the point sets PRDL establishes geometry descriptors to optimize the distribution of the point sets for face reconstruction. PRDL exhibits a clear gradient compared to the renderer-based methods and presents state-of-the-art reconstruction performance in extensive quantitative and qualitative experiments.

We devise an advanced reflection collection pipeline that is highly adaptable to a wide range of real-world reflection scenarios and incurs reduced costs in collecting large-scale aligned reflection pairs. In the process we develop a large-scale high-quality reflection dataset named Reflection Removal in the Wild (RRW). RRW contains over 14950 high-resolution real-world reflection pairs a dataset forty-five times larger than its predecessors. Regarding perception of reflection locations we identify that numerous virtual reflection objects visible in reflection images are not present in the corresponding ground-truth images. This observation drawn from the aligned pairs leads us to conceive the Maximum Reflection Filter (MaxRF). The MaxRF could accurately and explicitly characterize reflection locations from pairs of images. Building upon this we design a reflection location-aware cascaded framework specifically tailored for SIRR.

We refine pseudo-labels using intra-set correlations within each geometric consistency set and align features of visually and geometrically similar points using intra-scene and inter-scene correlation learning. We also introduce a feedback mechanism to distill the correlation learning capability into the 3D model. Experiments on both indoor and outdoor datasets show the superiority of our method.

However the existing MIL paradigm typically requires an offline instance feature extractor such as a pre-trained ResNet or a foundation model.

To address this issue we propose a Re-embedded Regional Transformer (RRT) for re-embedding the instance features online which captures fine-grained local features and establishes connections across different regions. Unlike existing works that focus on pre-training powerful feature extractor or designing sophisticated instance aggregator RRT is tailored to re-embed instance features online. It serves as a portable module that can seamlessly integrate into mainstream MIL models. Extensive experimental results on common computational pathology tasks validate that: 1) feature re-embedding improves the performance of MIL models based on ResNet-50 features to the level of foundation model features and further enhances the performance of foundation model features; 2) the RRT can introduce more significant performance improvements to various MIL models; 3) RRT-MIL as an RRT-enhanced AB-MIL outperforms other latest methods by a large margin.

Yet the two problems have largely been approached independently without much synergy. Most visual SLAM methods can only reconstruct camera trajectories and scene structures up to scale while most HMR methods reconstruct human meshes in metric scale but fall short in reasoning with cameras and scenes. This work introduces Synergistic Camera and Human Reconstruction (SynCHMR) to marry the best of both worlds. Specifically we design Human-aware Metric SLAM to reconstruct metric-scale camera poses and scene point clouds using camera-frame HMR as a strong prior addressing depth scale and dynamic ambiguities. Conditioning on the dense scene recovered we further learn a Scene-aware SMPL Denoiser to enhance world-frame HMR by incorporating spatiotemporal coherency and dynamic scene constraints.

However most benchmarks predominantly assess spatial understanding in the static image tasks while overlooking temporal understanding in the dynamic video tasks. To alleviate this issue we introduce a comprehensive Multi-modal Video understanding Benchmark namely MVBench which covers 20 challenging video tasks that cannot be effectively solved with a single frame. Specifically we first introduce a novel static-to-dynamic method to define these temporal-related tasks. By transforming various static tasks into dynamic ones we enable the systematic generation of video tasks that require a broad spectrum of temporal skills ranging from perception to cognition. Then guided by the task definition we automatically convert public video annotations into multiple-choice QA to evaluate each task. On one hand such a distinct paradigm allows us to build MVBench efficiently without much manual intervention. On the other hand it guarantees evaluation fairness with ground-truth video annotations avoiding the biased scoring of LLMs. Moreover we further develop a robust video MLLM baseline i.e. VideoChat2 by progressive multi-modal training with diverse instruction-tuning data. The extensive results on our MVBench reveal that the existing MLLMs are far from satisfactory in temporal understanding while our VideoChat2 largely surpasses these leading models by over 15% on MVBench."},

However we note that the effect of spatial scales of anomalies is ignored. The fact that many abnormal events occur in limited localized regions and severe background noise interferes with the learning of anomalous changes. Meanwhile most existing methods are limited by coarse-grained modeling approaches which are inadequate for learning highly discriminative features to discriminate subtle differences between small-scale anomalies and normal patterns. To this end this paper address multi-scale video anomaly detection by multi-grained spatio-temporal representation learning. We utilize video continuity to design three proxy tasks to perform feature learning at both coarse-grained and fine-grained levels i.e. continuity judgment discontinuity localization and missing frame estimation. In particular we formulate missing frame estimation as a contrastive learning task in feature space instead of a reconstruction task in RGB space to learn highly discriminative features. Experiments show that our proposed method outperforms state-of-the-art methods on four datasets especially in scenes with small-scale anomalies."},

To address these challenges we introduce FedAF a novel aggregation-free FL algorithm. In this framework clients collaboratively learn condensed data by leveraging peer knowledge the server subsequently trains the global model using the condensed data and soft labels received from the clients. FedAF inherently avoids the issue of client drift enhances the quality of condensed data amid notable data heterogeneity and improves the global model performance.

To this end recent works explore two-stage prediction frameworks where coarse trajectories are first proposed and then used to select critical context information for trajectory refinement. However they either incur a large amount of computation or bring limited improvement if not both. In this paper we introduce a novel scenario-adaptive refinement strategy named SmartRefine to refine prediction with minimal additional computation. Specifically SmartRefine can comprehensively adapt refinement configurations based on each scenario's properties and smartly chooses the number of refinement iterations by introducing a quality score to measure the prediction quality and remaining refinement potential of each scenario. SmartRefine is designed as a generic and flexible approach that can be seamlessly integrated into most state-of-the-art motion prediction models. Experiments on Argoverse (1 & 2) show that our method consistently improves the prediction accuracy of multiple state-of-the-art prediction models.

Indeed recent work on semantic segmentation reports improved accuracy from supervised training leveraging hierarchical label structures. Encouraged by these results we revisit the fundamental assumptions behind that work. We postulate and then empirically verify that the reasons for the observed improvement in segmentation accuracy may be entirely unrelated to the use of the semantic hierarchy. To demonstrate this we design a range of cross-domain experiments with a representative hierarchical approach. We find that on the new testing domains a flat (non-hierarchical) segmentation network in which the parents are inferred from the children has superior segmentation accuracy to the hierarchical approach across the board. Complementing these findings and inspired by the intrinsic properties of hyperbolic spaces we study a more principled approach to hierarchical segmentation using the Poincare ball model. The hyperbolic representation largely outperforms the previous (Euclidean) hierarchical approach as well and is on par with our flat Euclidean baseline in terms of segmentation accuracy. However it additionally exhibits surprisingly strong calibration quality of the parent nodes in the semantic hierarchy especially on the more challenging domains. Our combined analysis suggests that the established practice of hierarchical segmentation may be limited to in-domain settings whereas flat classifiers generalize substantially better especially if they are modeled in the hyperbolic space."},

There have been tremendous efforts to enhance the depth quality ranging from optimization-based to learning-based methods. Despite the remarkable progress for a long time their applicability in the real world is limited due to systematic measurement biases such as density sensing pattern and scan range. It is well-known that the biases make it difficult for these methods to achieve their generalization. We observe that learning a joint representation for input modalities (e.g. images and depth) which most recent methods adopt is sensitive to the biases. In this work we disentangle those modalities to mitigate the biases with prompt engineering. For this we design a novel depth prompt module to allow the desirable feature representation according to new depth distributions from either sensor types or scene configurations. Our depth prompt can be embedded into foundation models for monocular depth estimation. Through this embedding process our method helps the pretrained model to be free from restraint of depth scan range and to provide absolute scale depth maps.

The 3D context modeled by the convolutional network enables our method to synthesis sharper scene structures than prior works. Our MuRF achieves state-of-the-art performance across multiple different baseline settings and diverse scenarios ranging from simple objects (DTU) to complex indoor and outdoor scenes (RealEstate10K and LLFF). We also show promising zero-shot generalization abilities on the Mip-NeRF 360 dataset demonstrating the general applicability of MuRF."},
{"title": "Predicated Diffusion: Predicate Logic-Based Attention Guidance for Text-to-Image Diffusion Models", "authors": "Kota Sueyoshi, Takashi Matsubara", "abstract": "Diffusion models have achieved remarkable success in generating high-quality diverse and creative images. However in text-based image generation they often struggle to accurately capture the intended meaning of the text. For instance a specified object might not be generated or an adjective might incorrectly alter unintended objects. Moreover we found that relationships indicating possession between objects are frequently overlooked. Despite the diversity of users' intentions in text existing methods often focus on only some aspects of these intentions. In this paper we propose Predicated Diffusion a unified framework designed to more effectively express users' intentions. It represents the intended meaning as propositions using predicate logic and treats the pixels in attention maps as fuzzy predicates. This approach provides a differentiable loss function that offers guidance for the image generation process to better fulfill the propositions. Comparative evaluations with existing methods demonstrated that Predicated Diffusion excels in generating images faithful to various text prompts while maintaining high image quality as validated by human evaluators and pretrained image-text models."},

Here we leverage complementary information from gene expression profiles to guide slide representation learning using multi-modal pre-training. Expression profiles constitute highly detailed molecular descriptions of a tissue that we hypothesize offer a strong task-agnostic training signal for learning slide embeddings. Our slide and expression (S+E) pretraining strategy called TANGLE employs modality-specific encoders the outputs of which are aligned via contrastive learning. TANGLE was pre-trained on samples from three different organs: liver (n=6597 S+E pairs) breast (n=1020) and lung (n=1012) from two different species (Homo sapiens and Rattus norvegicus). Across three independent test datasets consisting of 1265 breast WSIs 1946 lung WSIs and 4584 liver WSIs TANGLE shows significantly better few-shot performance compared to supervised and SSL baselines. When assessed using prototype-based classification and slide retrieval TANGLE also shows a substantial performance improvement over all baselines.

{"title": "DVMNet: Computing Relative Pose for Unseen Objects Beyond Hypotheses", "authors": "Chen Zhao, Tong Zhang, Zheng Dang, Mathieu Salzmann", "abstract": "Determining the relative pose of an object between two images is pivotal to the success of generalizable object pose estimation. Existing approaches typically approximate the continuous pose representation with a large number of discrete pose hypotheses which incurs a computationally expensive process of scoring each hypothesis at test time. By contrast we present a Deep Voxel Matching Network (DVMNet) that eliminates the need for pose hypotheses and computes the relative object pose in a single pass. To this end we map the two input RGB images reference and query to their respective voxelized 3D representations. We then pass the resulting voxels through a pose estimation module where the voxels are aligned and the pose is computed in an end-to-end fashion by solving a least-squares problem. To enhance robustness we introduce a weighted closest voxel algorithm capable of mitigating the impact of noisy voxels. We conduct extensive experiments on the CO3D LINEMOD and Objaverse datasets demonstrating that our method delivers more accurate relative pose estimates for novel objects at a lower computational cost compared to state-of-the-art methods.

Recent progress in deep quality-fitting-based methods that train models to align with quality anchors has shown promise in FIQA. However these methods heavily depend on a recognition model to yield quality anchors and indiscriminately treat the confidence of inaccurate anchors as equivalent to that of accurate ones during the FIQA model training leading to a fitting bottleneck issue. This paper seeks a solution by putting forward the Confidence-Calibrated Face Image Quality Assessment (CLIB-FIQA) approach underpinned by the synergistic interplay between the quality anchors and objective quality factors such as blur pose expression occlusion and illumination. Specifically we devise a joint learning framework built upon the vision-language alignment model which leverages the joint distribution with multiple quality factors to facilitate the quality fitting of the FIQA model. Furthermore to alleviate the issue of the model placing excessive trust in inaccurate quality anchors we propose a confidence calibration method to correct the quality distribution by exploiting to the fullest extent of these objective quality factors characterized as the merged-factor distribution during training. Experimental results on eight datasets reveal the superior performance of the proposed method."},

Its primary aim is to uncover the CAD process behind a physical object given its 3D scan. We propose CAD-SIGNet an end-to-end trainable and auto-regressive architecture to recover the design history of a CAD model represented as a sequence of sketch- and-extrusion from an input point cloud. Our model learns CAD visual-language representations by layer-wise cross-attention between point cloud and CAD language embedding. In particular a new Sketch instance Guided Attention (SGA) module is proposed in order to reconstruct the fine- grained details of the sketches. Thanks to its auto-regressive nature CAD-SIGNet not only reconstructs a unique full design history of the corresponding CAD model given an in- put point cloud but also provides multiple plausible design choices. This allows for an interactive reverse engineering scenario by providing designers with multiple next step choices along with the design process. Extensive experiments on publicly available CAD datasets showcase the effectiveness of our approach against existing baseline models in two settings namely full design history recovery and conditional auto-completion from point clouds."},

The idea is to apply a language decoder that auto-regressively predicts the text tokens from image embeddings to form labels. To ground this prediction process in auto-regression we customize a non-causal attention mask for the decoder incorporating two key features: modeling tokens from different labels to be independent and treating image tokens as a prefix. This masking mechanism inspires an efficient method -- one-shot sampling -- to simultaneously sample tokens of multiple labels in parallel and rank generated labels by their probabilities during inference. To further enhance the efficiency we propose a simple strategy to construct a compact decoder by simply discarding the intermediate blocks of a pretrained language model. This approach yields a decoder that matches the full model's performance while being notably more efficient. The code is available at https://github.com/kaiyuyue/nxtp."},

Learning a localized concept and placing it on an object in a target image is a nontrivial task as the objects may have different orientations and shapes. Our approach builds upon recent advancements in visual concept learning. It involves acquiring a visual concept (e.g. an ornament) from a source image and subsequently applying it to an object (e.g. a chair) in a target image. Our key idea is to perform in-context concept learning acquiring the local visual concept within the broader context of the objects they belong to. To localize the concept learning we employ soft masks that contain both the concept within the mask and the surrounding image area. We demonstrate our approach through object generation within an image showcasing plausible embedding of in-context learned concepts. We also introduce methods for directing acquired concepts to specific locations within target images employing cross-attention mechanisms and establishing correspondences between source and target objects. The effectiveness of our method is demonstrated through quantitative and qualitative experiments along with comparisons against baseline techniques."},

Prior approaches to leverage such data mainly consider the application of uni-modal noisy label learning without amending the impact on both cross-modal and intra-modal geometrical structures in multimodal learning. Actually we find that both structures are effective to discriminate noisy correspondence through structural differences when being well-established. Inspired by this observation we introduce a Geometrical Structure Consistency (GSC) method to infer the true correspondence. Specifically GSC ensures the preservation of geometrical structures within and between modalities allowing for the accurate discrimination of noisy samples based on structural differences. Utilizing these inferred true correspondence labels GSC refines the learning of geometrical structures by filtering out the noisy samples. Experiments across four cross-modal datasets confirm that GSC effectively identifies noisy samples and significantly outperforms the current leading methods.

In this paper we introduce Grasp-Anything++ a new language-driven grasp detection dataset featuring 1M samples over 3M objects and upwards of 10M grasping instructions. We utilize foundation models to create a large-scale scene corpus with corresponding images and grasp prompts. We approach the language-driven grasp detection task as a conditional generation problem. Drawing on the success of diffusion models in generative tasks and given that language plays a vital role in this task we propose a new language-driven grasp detection method based on diffusion models. Our key contribution is the contrastive training objective which explicitly contributes to the denoising process to detect the grasp pose given the language instructions. We illustrate that our approach is theoretically supportive. The intensive experiments show that our method outperforms state-of-the-art approaches and allows real-world robotic grasping. Finally we demonstrate our large-scale dataset enables zero-short grasp detection and is a challenging benchmark for future work."},

Nevertheless HTML documents may not provide a clear task-related context for each element making it hard to select the right (sequence of) actions. In this paper we propose to contextualize HTML elements through their \"dual views\" in webpage screenshots: each HTML element has its corresponding bounding box and visual content in the screenshot. We build upon the insight---web developers tend to arrange task-related elements nearby on webpages to enhance user experiences---and propose to contextualize each element with its neighbor elements using both textual and visual features. The resulting representations of HTML elements are more informative for the agent to take action. We validate our method on the recently released Mind2Web dataset which features diverse navigation domains and tasks on real-world websites. Our method consistently outperforms the baseline in all the scenarios including cross-task cross-website and cross-domain ones."},

Recently various fast samplers utilizing higher-order ODE solvers have emerged and achieved better performance than the initial first-order one. However these numerical methods inherently result in certain approximation errors which significantly degrades sample quality with extremely small NFE (e.g. around 5). In contrast based on the geometric observation that each sampling trajectory almost lies in a two-dimensional subspace embedded in the ambient space we propose Approximate MEan-Direction Solver (AMED-Solver) that eliminates truncation errors by directly learning the mean direction for fast diffusion sampling. Besides our method can be easily used as a plugin to further improve existing ODE-based samplers. Extensive experiments on image synthesis with the resolution ranging from 32 to 512 demonstrate the effectiveness of our method.

We achieve this by training a model to directly predict discriminative embeddings for viewpoints surrounding the object.

{"title": "Relation Rectification in Diffusion Model", "authors": "Yinwei Wu, Xingyi Yang, Xinchao Wang", "abstract": "Despite their exceptional generative abilities large T2I diffusion models much like skilled but careless artists often struggle with accurately depicting visual relationships between objects. This issue as we uncover through careful analysis arises from a misaligned text encoder that struggles to interpret specific relationships and differentiate the logical order of associated objects. To resolve this we introduce a novel task termed Relation Rectification aiming to refine the model to accurately represent a given relationship it initially fails to generate. To address this we propose an innovative solution utilizing a Heterogeneous Graph Convolutional Network (HGCN). It models the directional relationships between relation terms and corresponding objects within the input prompts. Specifically we optimize the HGCN on a pair of prompts with identical relational words but reversed object orders supplemented by a few reference images. The lightweight HGCN adjusts the text embeddings generated by the text encoder ensuring accurate reflection of the textual relation in the embedding space. Crucially our method retains the parameters of the text encoder and diffusion model preserving the model's robust performance on unrelated descriptions. We validated our approach on a newly curated dataset of diverse relational data demonstrating both quantitative and qualitative enhancements in generating images with precise visual relations.

However their performance drops on larger objects leading to fatal accidents. Some attribute the failures to training data scarcity or the receptive field requirements of large objects. In this paper we highlight this understudied problem of generalization to large objects. We find that modern frontal detectors struggle to generalize to large objects even on nearly balanced datasets. We argue that the cause of failure is the sensitivity of depth regression losses to noise of larger objects. To bridge this gap we comprehensively investigate regression and dice losses examining their robustness under varying error levels and object sizes. We mathematically prove that the dice loss leads to superior noise-robustness and model convergence for large objects compared to regression losses for a simplified case. Leveraging our theoretical insights we propose SeaBird (Segmentation in Bird's View) as the first step towards generalizing to large objects. SeaBird effectively integrates BEV segmentation on foreground objects for 3D detection with the segmentation head trained with the dice loss. SeaBird achieves SoTA results on the KITTI-360 leaderboard and improves existing detectors on the nuScenes leaderboard particularly for large objects."},

However most of them request supervised pre-training on labelled datasets. This paper proposes an unsupervised kernel estimation model named dynamic kernel prior (DKP) to realize an unsupervised and pre-training-free learning-based algorithm for solving the BSR problem. DKP can adaptively learn dynamic kernel priors to realize real-time kernel estimation and thereby enables superior HR image restoration performances. This is achieved by a Markov chain Monte Carlo sampling process on random kernel distributions. The learned kernel prior is then assigned to optimize a blur kernel estimation network which entails a network-based Langevin dynamic optimization strategy. These two techniques ensure the accuracy of the kernel estimation. DKP can be easily used to replace the kernel estimation models in the existing methods such as Double-DIP and FKP-DIP or be added to the off-the-shelf image restoration model such as diffusion model. In this paper we incorporate our DKP model with DIP and diffusion model referring to DIP-DKP and Diff-DKP for validations. Extensive simulations on Gaussian and motion kernel scenarios demonstrate that the proposed DKP model can significantly improve the kernel estimation with comparable runtime and memory usage leading to state-of-the-art BSR results.

Nonetheless FL remains susceptible to utility and privacy attacks notably evasion data poisoning and model inversion attacks compromising the system's efficiency and data privacy. Existing FL defenses are often specialized to a particular single attack lacking generality and a comprehensive defender's perspective. To address these challenges we introduce Federated Cryptography Defense (FCD) a unified single framework aligning with the defender's perspective. FCD employs row-wise transposition cipher based data encryption with a secret key to counter both evasion black-box data poisoning and model inversion attacks. The crux of FCD lies in transferring the entire learning process into an encrypted data space and using a novel distillation loss guided by the Kullback-Leibler (KL) divergence. This measure compares the probability distributions of the local pretrained teacher model's predictions on normal data and the local student model's predictions on the same data in FCD's encrypted form. By working within this encrypted space FCD eliminates the need for decryption at the server resulting in reduced computational complexity. We demonstrate the practical feasibility of FCD and apply it to defend against evasion utility attack on benchmark datasets (GTSRB KBTS CIFAR10 and EMNIST). We further extend FCD for defending against model inversion attack in split FL on the CIFAR100 dataset. Our experiments across the diverse attack and FL settings demonstrate practical feasibility and robustness against utility evasion (impact >30) and privacy attacks (MSE >73) compared to the second best method."},

Our method distills diffusion features from image foundational models onto input shapes. Specifically we use the input shapes to produce depth and normal maps as guidance for conditional image synthesis. In the process we produce (diffusion) features in 2D that we subsequently lift and aggregate on the original surface. Our key observation is that even if the conditional image generations obtained from multi-view rendering of the input shapes are inconsistent the associated image features are robust and hence can be directly aggregated across views. This produces semantic features on the input shapes without requiring additional data or training. We perform extensive experiments on multiple benchmarks (SHREC'19 SHREC'20 FAUST and TOSCA) and demonstrate that our features being semantic instead of geometric produce reliable correspondence across both isometric and non-isometrically related shape families.

The task generation is facilitated through multiple dialogues as iterations and subsequently corrected and refined by our designed self-promptings and demonstrations. With a corpus of both explicit situated facts and implicit commonsense we generate associated question-answer pairs and reasoning processes finally followed by manual reviews for quality assurance.

Most existing methods have tackled this task in a two-stage manner first detecting the human body part with an off-the-shelf detection model and then inferring the different human body parts individually. Despite the impressive results achieved these methods suffer from 1) loss of valuable contextual information via cropping 2) introducing distractions and 3) lacking inter-association among different persons and body parts inevitably causing performance degradation especially for crowded scenes. To address these issues we introduce a novel all-in-one-stage framework AiOS for multiple expressive human pose and shape recovery without an additional human detection step. Specifically our method is built upon DETR which treats multi-person whole-body mesh recovery task as a progressive set prediction problem with various sequential detection. We devise the decoder tokens and extend them to our task. Specifically we first employ a human token to probe a human location in the image and encode global features for each instance which provides a coarse location for the later transformer block. Then we introduce a joint-related token to probe the human joint in the image and encoder a fine-grained local feature which collaborates with the global feature to regress the whole-body mesh. This straightforward but effective model outperforms previous state-of-the-art methods by a 9 reduction in NMVE on AGORA a 30 reduction in PVE on EHF a 10 reduction in PVE on ARCTIC and a 3 reduction in PVE on EgoBody."},

However given the square complexity of convolution scaling up kernels can bring about an enormous amount of parameters and the proliferated parameters can induce severe optimization problem. Due to these issues current CNNs compromise to scale up to 51x51 in the form of stripe convolution (i.e. 51x5+5x51) and start to saturate as the kernel size continues growing. In this paper we delve into addressing these vital issues and explore whether we can continue scaling up kernels for more performance gains. Inspired by human vision we propose a human-like peripheral convolution that efficiently reduces over 90% parameter count of dense grid convolution through parameter sharing and manage to scale up kernel size to extremely large. Our peripheral convolution behaves highly similar to human reducing the complexity of convolution from O(K^2) to O(logK) without backfiring performance. Built on this we propose Parameter-efficient Large Kernel Network (PeLK). Our PeLK outperforms modern vision Transformers and ConvNet architectures like Swin ConvNeXt RepLKNet and SLaK on various vision tasks including ImageNet classification semantic segmentation on ADE20K and object detection on MS COCO. For the first time we successfully scale up the kernel size of CNNs to an unprecedented 101x101 and demonstrate consistent improvements."},

In this paper we introduce MACE a finetuning framework for the task of mass concept erasure. This task aims to prevent models from generating images that embody unwanted concepts when prompted. Existing concept erasure methods are typically restricted to handling fewer than five concepts simultaneously and struggle to find a balance between erasing concept synonyms (generality) and maintaining unrelated concepts (specificity). In contrast MACE differs by successfully scaling the erasure scope up to 100 concepts and by achieving an effective balance between generality and specificity. This is achieved by leveraging closed-form cross-attention refinement along with LoRA finetuning collectively eliminating the information of undesirable concepts. Furthermore MACE integrates multiple LoRAs without mutual interference. We conduct extensive evaluations of MACE against prior methods across four different tasks: object erasure celebrity erasure explicit content erasure and artistic style erasure. Our results reveal that MACE surpasses prior methods in all evaluated tasks. Code is available at https://github.com/Shilin-LU/MACE."},

Most prior works concentrate on the techniques of architectures replay data regularization etc. However the category name of each class is largely neglected. Existing methods commonly utilize the one-hot labels and randomly initialize the classifier head. We argue that the scarce semantic information conveyed by the one-hot labels hampers the effective knowledge transfer across tasks. In this paper we revisit the role of the classifier head within the CL paradigm and replace the classifier with semantic knowledge from pretrained language models (PLMs). Specifically we use PLMs to generate semantic targets for each class which are frozen and serve as supervision signals during training. Such targets fully consider the semantic correlation between all classes across tasks. Empirical studies show that our approach mitigates forgetting by alleviating representation drifting and facilitating knowledge transfer across tasks. The proposed method is simple to implement and can seamlessly be plugged into existing methods with negligible adjustments. Extensive experiments based on eleven mainstream baselines demonstrate the effectiveness and generalizability of our approach to various protocols. For example under the class-incremental learning setting on ImageNet-100 our method significantly improves the Top-1 accuracy by 3.2% to 6.1% while reducing the forgetting rate by 2.6% to 13.1%."},

Jha", "abstract": "Deployment of Transformer models on edge devices is becoming increasingly challenging due to the exponentially growing inference cost that scales quadratically with the number of tokens in the input sequence. Token pruning is an emerging solution to address this challenge due to its ease of deployment on various Transformer backbones. However most token pruning methods require computationally expensive fine-tuning which is undesirable in many edge deployment cases. In this work we propose Zero-TPrune the first zero-shot method that considers both the importance and similarity of tokens in performing token pruning. It leverages the attention graph of pre-trained Transformer models to produce an importance distribution for tokens via our proposed Weighted Page Rank (WPR) algorithm. This distribution further guides token partitioning for efficient similarity-based pruning. Due to the elimination of the fine-tuning overhead Zero-TPrune can prune large models at negligible computational cost switch between different pruning configurations at no computational cost and perform hyperparameter tuning efficiently. We evaluate the performance of Zero-TPrune on vision tasks by applying it to various vision Transformer backbones and testing them on ImageNet. Without any fine-tuning Zero-TPrune reduces the FLOPs cost of DeiT-S by 34.7% and improves its throughput by 45.3% with only 0.4% accuracy loss. Compared with state-of-the-art pruning methods that require fine-tuning Zero-TPrune not only eliminates the need for fine-tuning after pruning but also does so with only 0.1% accuracy loss.

The main challenge arises from the lack of labeled data where existing ground-truth datasets are nowhere near generalizable in interaction type and object category which inhibits the modeling of diverse 3D hand-object interaction with the correct physical implication (e.g. contacts and semantics) from text prompts. To address this challenge we propose to decompose the interaction generation task into two subtasks: hand-object contact generation; and hand-object motion generation. For contact generation a VAE-based network takes as input a text and an object mesh and generates the probability of contacts between the surfaces of hands and the object during the interaction. The network learns a variety of local geometry structure of diverse objects that is independent of the objects' category and thus it is applicable to general objects. For motion generation a Transformer-based diffusion model utilizes this 3D contact map as a strong prior for generating physically plausible hand-object motion as a function of text prompts by learning from the augmented labeled dataset; where we annotate text labels from many existing 3D hand and object motion data. Finally we further introduce a hand refiner module that minimizes the distance between the object surface and hand joints to improve the temporal stability of the object-hand contacts and to suppress the penetration artifacts. In the experiments we demonstrate that our method can generate more realistic and diverse interactions compared to other baseline methods. We also show that our method is applicable to unseen objects. We will release our model and newly labeled data as a strong foundation for future research.

The performances of these methods are significantly affected by the quality of the anchors. However the anchors generated by previous works solely rely on single-view information ignoring the correlation among different views. In particular we observe that similar patterns are more likely to exist between similar views so such correlation information can be leveraged to enhance the quality of the anchors which is also omitted. To this end we propose a novel plug-and-play anchor enhancement strategy through view correlation for multi-view clustering. Specifically we construct a view graph based on aligned initial anchor graphs to explore inter-view correlations. By learning from view correlation we enhance the anchors of the current view using the relationships between anchors and samples on neighboring views thereby narrowing the spatial distribution of anchors on similar views. Experimental results on seven datasets demonstrate the superiority of our proposed method over other existing methods.

In this paper we build on the DETR approach and extend it to the joint detection of objects and their relationships by introducing an approximated bipartite matching. While our method can generalize to an arbitrary number of objects we here focus on the modeling of object pairs and their relations. In particular we apply our method PairDETR to the problem of detecting human bodies and faces and associating them for the same person. Our approach not only eliminates the need for hand-designed post-processing but also achieves excellent results for body-face associations.

In this paper we identify a novel security threat towards such a paradigm from the perspective of backdoor attacks. Specifically an extra prompt token called the switch token in this work can turn the backdoor mode on i.e. converting a benign model into a backdoored one. Once under the backdoor mode a specific trigger can force the model to predict a target class. It poses a severe risk to the users of cloud API since the malicious behavior can not be activated and detected under the benign mode thus making the attack very stealthy. To attack a pre-trained model our proposed attack named SWARM learns a trigger and prompt tokens including a switch token. They are optimized with the clean loss which encourages the model always behaves normally even the trigger presents and the backdoor loss that ensures the backdoor can be activated by the trigger when the switch is on. Besides we utilize the cross-mode feature distillation to reduce the effect of the switch token on clean samples. The experiments on diverse visual recognition tasks confirm the success of our switchable backdoor attack i.e. achieving 95%+ attack success rate and also being hard to be detected and removed.

This diverges from the prevalent practice of expanding memory banks to accommodate extensive historical information. Our specially designed \"memory deciphering\" study offers a pivotal insight underpinning such a strategy: expanding memory banks while seemingly beneficial actually increases the difficulty for VOS modules to decode relevant features due to the confusion from redundant information. By restricting memory banks to a limited number of essential frames we achieve a notable improvement in VOS accuracy. This process balances the importance and freshness of frames to maintain an informative memory bank within a bounded capacity.

To address this limitation we introduce a novel memory-scalable and efficient functional map learning pipeline. By leveraging the specific structure of functional maps we offer the possibility to achieve identical results without ever storing the pointwise map in memory. Furthermore based on the same approach we present a differentiable map refinement layer adapted from an existing axiomatic refinement algorithm. Unlike many functional map learning methods which use this algorithm at a post-processing step ours can be easily used at train time enabling to enforce consistency between the refined and initial versions of the map.

This decomposition is achieved via a bilinear dimension reduction method Partial Least Square (PLS) guided by useful supervision from the image classifier. We further interpret the semantic meaning of each subgroup component by generating natural language descriptions using vision-language foundation models. Finally DIM mitigates multiple biased subgroups simultaneously via two strategies including the data- and model-centric strategies. Extensive experiments on CIFAR-100 and Breeds datasets demonstrate the effectiveness of DIM in discovering and mitigating multiple biased subgroups. Furthermore DIM uncovers the failure modes of the classifier on Hard ImageNet showcasing its broader applicability to understanding model bias in image classifiers."},

Most existing detection methods either use uni-modal cues or rely on supervised training to capture the dissonance between the audio and visual modalities. While the former disregards the audio-visual correspondences entirely the latter predominantly focuses on discerning audio-visual cues within the training corpus thereby potentially overlooking correspondences that can help detect unseen deepfakes. We present Audio-Visual Feature Fusion (AVFF) a two-stage cross-modal learning method that explicitly captures the correspondence between the audio and visual modalities for improved deepfake detection. The first stage pursues representation learning via self-supervision on real videos to capture the intrinsic audio-visual correspondences. To extract rich cross-modal representations we use contrastive learning and autoencoding objectives and introduce a novel audio-visual complementary masking and feature fusion strategy. The learned representations are tuned in the second stage where deepfake classification is pursued via supervised learning on both real and fake videos. Extensive experiments and analysis suggest that our novel representation learning paradigm is highly discriminative in nature. We report 98.6% accuracy and 99.1% AUC on the FakeAVCeleb dataset outperforming the current audio-visual state-of-the-art by 14.9% and 9.9% respectively."},

Existing manufacturers usually rely on human eye observation to complete PBD which makes it difficult to balance the accuracy and efficiency of detection. To address this issue and drive more attention into this meaningful task we first elaborately collect a dataset called X-ray PBD which has 1500 diverse X-ray images selected from thousands of power batteries of 5 manufacturers with 7 different visual interference. Then we propose a novel segmentation-based solution for PBD termed multi-dimensional collaborative network (MDCNet). With the help of line and counting predictors the representation of the point segmentation branch can be improved at both semantic and detail aspects. Besides we design an effective distance-adaptive mask generation strategy which can alleviate the visual challenge caused by the inconsistent distribution density of plates to provide MDCNet with stable supervision. Without any bells and whistles our segmentation-based MDCNet consistently outperforms various other corner detection crowd counting and general/tiny object detection-based solutions making it a strong baseline that can help facilitate future research in PBD.

To address it the common practice is to gather multiple annotations from different experts leading to the setting of multi-rater medical image segmentation. Existing works aim to either merge different annotations into the \"groundtruth\" that is often unattainable in numerous medical contexts or generate diverse results or produce personalized results corresponding to individual expert raters. Here we bring up a more ambitious goal for multi-rater medical image segmentation i.e. obtaining both diversified and personalized results. Specifically we propose a two-stage framework named D-Persona (first Diversification and then Personalization). In Stage I we exploit multiple given annotations to train a Probabilistic U-Net model with a bound-constrained loss to improve the prediction diversity. In this way a common latent space is constructed in Stage I where different latent codes denote diversified expert opinions. Then in Stage II we design multiple attention-based projection heads to adaptively query the corresponding expert prompts from the shared latent space and then perform the personalized medical image segmentation. We evaluated the proposed model on our in-house Nasopharyngeal Carcinoma dataset and the public lung nodule dataset (i.e. LIDC-IDRI). Extensive experiments demonstrated our D-Persona can provide diversified and personalized results at the same time achieving new SOTA performance for multi-rater medical image segmentation.

To tackle these issues we introduce a motion sampler based on conditional flow matching which is capable of high-quality motion code generation in an efficient way. Moreover we introduce a novel conditioning method for the TTS system which utilises motion-removed features from the TFG model to yield uniform speech outputs.

Consequently it is essential to develop LiDAR perception methods that are both efficient and effective. Although naively enlarging 3D kernel size can enhance performance it will also lead to a cubically-increasing overhead. Therefore it is crucial to develop streamlined 3D large kernel designs that eliminate redundant weights and work effectively with larger kernels. In this paper we propose an efficient and effective Large Sparse Kernel 3D Neural Network (LSK3DNet) that leverages dynamic pruning to amplify the 3D kernel size. Our method comprises two core components: Spatial-wise Dynamic Sparsity (SDS) and Channel-wise Weight Selection (CWS). SDS dynamically prunes and regrows volumetric weights from the beginning to learn a large sparse 3D kernel. It not only boosts performance but also significantly reduces model size and computational cost. Moreover CWS selects the most important channels for 3D convolution during training and subsequently prunes the redundant channels to accelerate inference for 3D vision tasks. We demonstrate the effectiveness of LSK3DNet on three benchmark datasets and five tracks compared with classical models and large kernel designs. Notably LSK3DNet achieves the state-of-the-art performance on SemanticKITTI (i.e. 75.6% on single-scan and 63.4% on multi-scan) with roughly 40% model size reduction and 60% computing operations reduction compared to the naive large 3D kernel model."},

In this paper we present a Prior-based Latent Transformation approach (PLTrans) which is specifically designed to learn a degradation-unaware representation thereby allowing the restoration network to effectively generalize to real-world degradation. Toward this end PLTrans learns a degradation-unaware query via a latent diffusion-based regularization module. Furthermore conditioned on the features of a degraded face image a latent dictionary that captures the priors of HQ face images is leveraged to refine the features by mapping the top-d nearest elements. The refined version will be used to build key and value for the cross-attention computation which is tailored to each degraded image and exhibits reduced sensitivity to different degradation factors. Conditioned on the resulting representation we train a decoding network that synthesizes face images with authentic details and identity preservation. Through extensive experiments we verify the effectiveness of the design elements and demonstrate the generalization ability of our proposed approach for both synthetic and unknown degradations. We finally demonstrate the applicability of PLTrans in other vision tasks."},

Subsequently we identify data diversity and generalization gap between public and private data as critical factors addressing the limited public data.

They aim to retain beneficial knowledge for the target domain while suppressing unfavorable knowledge. During the pre-training and fine-tuning stages there is a notable disparity in the data scale. Consequently it is theoretically necessary to employ a model with reduced complexity to mitigate the potential structural risk. However our empirical investigation in this paper reveals that models fine-tuned using existing methods still manifest a high level of model complexity inherited from the pre-training stage leading to a suboptimal stability and generalization ability. This phenomenon indicates an issue that has been overlooked in fine-tuning: Structural Risk Minimization. To address this issue caused by data scale disparity during the fine-tuning stage we propose a simple yet effective approach called Tuning Stable Rank Shrinkage (TSRS). TSRS mitigates the structural risk during the fine-tuning stage by constraining the noise sensitivity of the target model based on stable rank theories. Through extensive experiments we demonstrate that incorporating TSRS into fine-tuning methods leads to improved generalization ability on various tasks regardless of whether the neural networks are based on convolution or transformer architectures. Additionally empirical analysis reveals that TSRS enhances the robustness convexity and smoothness of the loss landscapes in fine-tuned models.

Display photometric stereo which employs a conventional monitor as an illumination source has the potential to overcome limitations often encountered in bulky and difficult-to-use conventional setups. In this paper we present differentiable display photometric stereo (DDPS) addressing an often overlooked challenge in display photometric stereo: the design of display patterns. Departing from using heuristic display patterns DDPS learns the display patterns that yield accurate normal reconstruction for a target system in an end-to-end manner. To this end we propose a differentiable framework that couples basis-illumination image formation with analytic photometric-stereo reconstruction. The differentiable framework facilitates the effective learning of display patterns via auto-differentiation. Also for training supervision we propose to use 3D printing for creating a real-world training dataset enabling accurate reconstruction on the target real-world setup. Finally we exploit that conventional LCD monitors emit polarized light which allows for the optical separation of diffuse and specular reflections when combined with a polarization camera leading to accurate normal reconstruction. Extensive evaluation of DDPS shows improved normal-reconstruction accuracy compared to heuristic patterns and demonstrates compelling properties such as robustness to pattern initialization calibration errors and simplifications in image formation and reconstruction."},

This learned representation undergoes an inverse dual-tree complex wavelet transformation (DTCWT) to recover plane-based information. DaReNeRF computes features for each space-time point by fusing vectors from these recovered planes. Combining DaReNeRF with a tiny MLP for color regression and leveraging volume rendering in training yield state-of-the-art performance in novel view synthesis for complex dynamic scenes.

Given the prevalence of large visual variations of subject-object pairs even in the same predicate it can be quite challenging to model and refine predicate representations directly across such pairs which is however a common strategy adopted by most existing SGG methods. We observe that visual variations within the identical triplet are relatively small and certain relation cues are shared in the same type of triplet which can potentially facilitate the relation learning in SGG. Moreover for the long-tail problem widely studied in SGG task it is also crucial to deal with the limited types and quantity of triplets in tail predicates. Accordingly in this paper we propose a Dual-granularity Relation Modeling (DRM) network to leverage fine-grained triplet cues besides the coarse-grained predicate ones. DRM utilizes contexts and semantics of predicate and triplet with Dual-granularity Constraints generating compact and balanced representations from two perspectives to facilitate relation recognition. Furthermore a Dual-granularity Knowledge Transfer (DKT) strategy is introduced to transfer variation from head predicates/triplets to tail ones aiming to enrich the pattern diversity of tail classes to alleviate the long-tail problem.

We propose a simple zero-shot method for obtaining these illusions from off-the-shelf text-to-image diffusion models. During the reverse diffusion process we estimate the noise from different views of a noisy image and then combine these noise estimates together and denoise the image. A theoretical analysis suggests that this method works precisely for views that can be written as orthogonal transformations of which permutations are a subset. This leads to the idea of a   visual anagram ---an image that changes appearance under some rearrangement of pixels. This includes rotations and flips but also more exotic pixel permutations such as a jigsaw rearrangement. Our approach also naturally extends to illusions with more than two views.

Beyond regular Continual Learning (CL) attempting to address catastrophic forgetting with offline training of each task Online Continual Learning (OCL) is a more challenging yet realistic setting that performs CL in a one-pass data stream. Current OCL methods primarily rely on memory replay of old training samples. However a notable gap from CL to OCL stems from the additional overfitting-underfitting dilemma associated with the use of rehearsal buffers: the inadequate learning of new training samples (underfitting) and the repeated learning of a few old training samples (overfitting).

To address the above issues we propose FreeDrag a feature dragging methodology designed to free the burden on point tracking. The FreeDrag incorporates two key designs i.e. template feature via adaptive updating and line search with backtracking the former improves the stability against drastic content change by elaborately controlling the feature updating scale after each dragging while the latter alleviates the misguidance from similar points by actively restricting the search area in a line. These two technologies together contribute to a more stable semantic dragging with higher efficiency.

However RAG techniques for image generation may lead to parts of the retrieved samples being copied in the model's output. To reduce risks of leaking private information contained in the retrieved set we introduce Copy-Protected generation with Retrieval (CPR) a new method for RAG with strong copyright protection guarantees in a mixed-private setting for diffusion models. CPR allows to condition the output of diffusion models on a set of retrieved images while also guaranteeing that unique identifiable information about those example is not exposed in the generated outputs. In particular it does so by sampling from a mixture of public (safe) distribution and private (user) distribution by merging their diffusion scores at inference. We prove that CPR satisfies Near Access Freeness (NAF) which bounds the amount of information an attacker may be able to extract from the generated images. We provide two algorithms for copyright protection CPR-KL and CPR-Choose. Unlike previously proposed rejection-sampling-based NAF methods our methods enable efficient copyright-protected sampling with a single run of backward diffusion. We show that our method can be applied to any pre-trained conditional diffusion model such as Stable Diffusion or unCLIP.

Specifically the reduced image which has a low spectral dimension lies in the image field and can be inferred from our improved diffusion model where a new guidance function with total variation (TV) prior is designed to ensure that the reduced image can be well sampled. The coefficient matrix can be effectively pre-estimated based on singular value decomposition (SVD) and rank-revealing QR (RRQR) factorization. Furthermore a novel exponential noise schedule is proposed to accelerate the restoration process (about 5xacceleration for denoising) with little performance decrease. Extensive experimental results validate the superiority of our method in both performance and speed on a variety of HSI restoration tasks including HSI denoising noisy HSI super-resolution and noisy HSI inpainting.

Tracking-by-attention however entangles detection and tracking queries in one embedding for both the detection and tracking task which is sub-optimal. Other approaches resemble the tracking-by-detection paradigm detecting objects using decoupled track and detection queries followed by a subsequent association. These methods however do not leverage synergies between the detection and association task. Combining the strengths of both paradigms we introduce ADA-Track a novel end-to-end framework for 3D MOT from multi-view cameras. We introduce a learnable data association module based on edge-augmented cross-attention leveraging appearance and geometric features. Furthermore we integrate this association module into the decoder layer of a DETR-based 3D detector enabling simultaneous DETR-like query-to-image cross-attention for detection and query-to-query cross-attention for data association. By stacking these decoder layers queries are refined for the detection and association task alternately effectively harnessing the task dependencies. We evaluate our method on the nuScenes dataset and demonstrate the advantage of our approach compared to the two previous paradigms. Code is available at https://github.com/dsx0511/ADA-Track."},

To bridge this gap in collaboration with the self-driving company May Mobility we present the MARS dataset which unifies scenarios that enable MultiAgent multitraveRSal and multimodal autonomous vehicle research. More specifically MARS is collected with a fleet of autonomous vehicles driving within a certain geographical area. Each vehicle has its own route and different vehicles may appear at nearby locations. Each vehicle is equipped with a LiDAR and surround-view RGB cameras. We curate two subsets in MARS: one facilitates collaborative driving with multiple vehicles simultaneously present at the same location and the other enables memory retrospection through asynchronous traversals of the same location by multiple vehicles. We conduct experiments in place recognition and neural reconstruction. More importantly MARS introduces new research opportunities and challenges such as multitraversal 3D reconstruction multiagent perception and unsupervised object discovery.

Recent work has shown that coupling the two problems by iteratively refining one conditioned on the other's output yields SOTA results across domains. However training these models has proved challenging requiring a litany of tricks to stabilize and speed up training. In this work we take the visual odometry problem as an example and identify three plausible causes: (1) flow loss interference (2) linearization errors in the bundle adjustment (BA) layer and (3) dependence of weight gradients on the BA residual. We show how these issues result in noisy and higher variance gradients potentially leading to a slow down in training and instabilities. We then propose a simple solution to reduce the gradient variance by using the weights predicted by the network in the inner optimization loop to also weight the correspondence objective in the training problem. This helps the training objective 'focus' on the more important points thereby reducing the variance and mitigating the influence of outliers. We show that the resulting method leads to faster training and can be more flexibly trained in varying training setups without sacrificing performance. In particular we show 2-2.5x training speedups over a baseline visual odometry model we modify."},

For instance the advent of vision-language models like CLIP has opened the doorway for vision models to exploit the textual modality. In this paper we introduce a simple framework for generalizing semantic segmentation networks by employing language as the source of randomization. Our recipe comprises three key ingredients: (i) the preservation of the intrinsic CLIP robustness through minimal fine-tuning (ii) language-driven local style augmentation and (iii) randomization by locally mixing the source and augmented styles during training.

Nevertheless it is not trivial to capitalize on diffusion models for video super-resolution which necessitates not only the preservation of visual appearance from low-resolution to high-resolution videos but also the temporal consistency across video frames. In this paper we propose a novel approach pursuing Spatial Adaptation and Temporal Coherence (SATeCo) for video super-resolution. SATeCo pivots on learning spatial-temporal guidance from low-resolution videos to calibrate both latent-space high-resolution video denoising and pixel-space video reconstruction. Technically SATeCo freezes all the parameters of the pre-trained UNet and VAE and only optimizes two deliberately-designed spatial feature adaptation (SFA) and temporal feature alignment (TFA) modules in the decoder of UNet and VAE. SFA modulates frame features via adaptively estimating affine parameters for each pixel guaranteeing pixel-wise guidance for high-resolution frame synthesis. TFA delves into feature interaction within a 3D local window (tubelet) through self-attention and executes cross-attention between tubelet and its low-resolution counterpart to guide temporal feature alignment.

However recent studies have revealed the feasibility of weaponizing model quantization via implanting quantization-conditioned backdoors (QCBs). These special backdoors stay dormant on released full-precision models but will come into effect after standard quantization. Due to the peculiarity of QCBs existing defenses have minor effects on reducing their threats or are even infeasible. In this paper we conduct the first in-depth analysis of QCBs. We reveal that the activation of existing QCBs primarily stems from the nearest rounding operation and is closely related to the norms of neuron-wise truncation errors (i.e. the difference between the continuous fullprecision weights and its quantized version). Motivated by these insights we propose Error-guided Flipped Rounding with Activation Preservation (EFRAP) an effective and practical defense against QCBs. Specifically EFRAP learns a non-nearest rounding strategy with neuron-wise error norm and layer-wise activation preservation guidance flipping the rounding strategies of neurons crucial for backdoor effects but with minimal impact on clean accuracy. Extensive evaluations on benchmark datasets demonstrate that our EFRAP can defeat state-of-the-art QCB attacks under various settings. Code is available here."},

To specifically address the unique lighting conditions of nighttime and ensure the robustness of pseudo labels we propose adaptive channel masking and light uncertainty. By selectively masking channels that are less sensitive to lighting conditions adaptive channel masking directs the model to progressively focus on features less affected by variations in light colors and noise.

The required ground-truth data is hard to capture in 3D (mocap suits expensive setups) but easy to acquire in 2D (simple RGB cameras). Thus we design our method to only require 2D RGB data at inference time while being able to generate 3D human motion sequences. We use a differentiable 2D projection scheme in an autoregressive manner for weak supervision and an adversarial loss for 3D regularization. Our method predicts long and complex human behavior sequences (e.g. cooking assembly) consisting of multiple sub-actions. We tackle this in a semantically hierarchical manner jointly predicting high-level coarse action labels together with their low-level fine-grained realizations as characteristic 3D human poses. We observe that these two action representations are coupled in nature and joint prediction benefits both action and pose forecasting. Our experiments demonstrate the complementary nature of joint action and 3D pose prediction: our joint approach outperforms each task treated individually enables robust longer-term sequence prediction and improves over alternative approaches to forecast actions and characteristic 3D poses."},

Currently brain decoding is confined to a per-subject-per-model paradigm limiting its applicability to the same individual for whom the decoding model is trained. This constraint stems from three key challenges: 1) the inherent variability in input dimensions across subjects due to differences in brain size; 2) the unique intrinsic neural patterns influencing how different individuals perceive and process sensory information; 3) limited data availability for new subjects in real-world scenarios hampers the performance of decoding models. In this paper we present a novel approach MindBridge that achieves cross-subject brain decoding by employing only one model. Our proposed framework establishes a generic paradigm capable of addressing these challenges by introducing biological-inspired aggregation function and novel cyclic fMRI reconstruction mechanism for subject-invariant representation learning. Notably by cycle reconstruction of fMRI MindBridge can enable novel fMRI synthesis which also can serve as pseudo data augmentation. Within the framework we also devise a novel reset-tuning method for adapting a pretrained model to a new subject. Experimental results demonstrate MindBridge's ability to reconstruct images for multiple subjects which is competitive with dedicated subject-specific models.

To address this issue we focus on enhancing the source model's generalization capability to improve its ability to conduct transferable targeted adversarial attacks.

Previous work has made significant progress towards instance-level object pose refinement.

To address these challenges we introduce a novel architecture for category-level object pose refinement. Our approach integrates an HS-layer and learnable affine transformations which aims to enhance the extraction and alignment of geometric information. Additionally we introduce a cross-cloud transformation mechanism that efficiently merges diverse data sources. Finally we push the limits of our model by incorporating the shape prior information for translation and size error prediction. We conducted extensive experiments to demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed framework. Through extensive quantitative experiments we demonstrate significant improvement over the baseline method by a large margin across all metrics."},

While there have been striking improvements in image denoising with the emergence of advanced deep learning architectures and real-world datasets recent denoising networks struggle to maintain performance on images with noise that has not been seen during training. One typical approach to address the challenge would be to adapt a denoising network to new noise distribution. Instead in this work we shift our attention to the input noise itself for adaptation rather than adapting a network. Thus we keep a pretrained network frozen and adapt an input noise to capture the fine-grained deviations. As such we propose a new denoising algorithm dubbed Learning-to-Adapt-Noise (LAN) where a learnable noise offset is directly added to a given noisy image to bring a given input noise closer towards the noise distribution a denoising network is trained to handle. Consequently the proposed framework exhibits performance improvement on images with unseen noise displaying the potential of the proposed research direction."},

Existing attacks are often not evasive to established backdoor detection techniques. This susceptibility primarily stems from the fact that these attacks typically leverage a universal trigger pattern or transformation function such that the trigger can cause misclassification for any input. In response to this recent papers have introduced attacks using sample-specific invisible triggers crafted through special transformation functions. While these approaches manage to evade detection to some extent they reveal vulnerability to existing backdoor mitigation techniques. To address and enhance both evasiveness and resilience we introduce a novel backdoor attack LOTUS. Specifically it leverages a secret function to separate samples in the victim class into a set of partitions and applies unique triggers to different partitions. Furthermore LOTUS incorporates an effective trigger focusing mechanism ensuring only the trigger corresponding to the partition can induce the backdoor behavior. Extensive experimental results show that LOTUS can achieve high attack success rate across 4 datasets and 7 model structures and effectively evading 13 backdoor detection and mitigation techniques.

Traditionally developing classifiers for such concepts requires substantial manual effort measured in hours days or even months to identify and annotate data needed for training. Even with recently proposed Agile Modeling techniques which enable rapid bootstrapping of image classifiers users are still required to spend 30 minutes or more of monotonous repetitive data labeling just to train a single classifier. Drawing on Fiske's Cognitive Miser theory we propose a new framework that alleviates manual effort by replacing human labeling with natural language interactions reducing the total effort required to define a concept by an order of magnitude: from labeling 2000 images to only 100 plus some natural language interactions. Our framework leverages recent advances in foundation models both large language models and vision-language models to carve out the concept space through conversation and by automatically labeling training data points. Most importantly our framework eliminates the need for crowd-sourced annotations. Moreover our framework ultimately produces lightweight classification models that are deployable in cost-sensitive scenarios. Across 15 subjective concepts and across 2 public image classification datasets our trained models outperform traditional Agile Modeling as well as state-of-the-art zero-shot classification models like ALIGN CLIP CuPL and large visual question answering models like PaLI-X."},

Poorly adjusted camera exposure often leads to critical failure and performance degradation. Traditional camera exposure control methods require multiple convergence steps and time-consuming processes making them unsuitable for dynamic lighting conditions. In this paper we propose a new camera exposure control framework that rapidly controls camera exposure while performing real-time processing by exploiting deep reinforcement learning. The proposed framework consists of four contributions: 1) a simplified training ground to simulate real-world's diverse and dynamic lighting changes 2) flickering and image attribute-aware reward design along with lightweight state design for real-time processing 3) a static-to-dynamic lighting curriculum to gradually improve the agent's exposure-adjusting capability and 4) domain randomization techniques to alleviate the limitation of the training ground and achieve seamless generalization in the wild. As a result our proposed method rapidly reaches a desired exposure level within five steps with real-time processing (1 ms). Also the acquired images are well-exposed and show superiority in various computer vision tasks such as feature extraction and object detection."},

Recent methods learn the resampling kernels for warping through neural networks to estimate missing values in irregular grids which however fail to capture local variations in deformed content and produce images with distortion and less high-frequency details. To address this issue this paper proposes an effective method namely MFR to learn Multi-Frequency Representations from input images for image warping. Specifically we propose a progressive filtering network to learn image representations from different frequency subbands and generate deformable images in a coarse-to-fine manner. Furthermore we employ learnable Gabor wavelet filters to improve the model's capability to learn local spatial-frequency representations. Comprehensive experiments including homography transformation equirectangular to perspective projection and asymmetric image super-resolution demonstrate that the proposed MFR significantly outperforms state-of-the-art image warping methods. Our method also showcases superior generalization to out-of-distribution domains where the generated images are equipped with rich details and less distortion thereby high visual quality.

Various methods have been put forward for this task but some challenges still exist. For instance it is difficult for CNN-based methods to handle global information and long-range dependencies between input images for which transformer-based methods have been proposed. Although transformer can better model the relationship between content and style images they require high-cost hardware and time-consuming inference. To address these issues we design a novel transformer model that includes only encoders thus significantly reducing the computational cost. In addition we also find that existing style transfer methods may lead to images under-stylied or missing content. In order to achieve better stylization we design a content feature extractor and a style feature extractor. Then we can feed pure content and style images into the transformer. Finally we propose a network model termed Puff-Net i.e. efficient style transfer with pure content and style feature fusion network.

However its application in medical imaging presents challenges requiring either substantial training costs and extensive medical datasets for full model fine-tuning or high-quality prompts for optimal performance. This paper introduces H-SAM: a prompt-free adaptation of SAM tailored for efficient fine-tuning of medical images via a two-stage hierarchical decoding procedure. In the initial stage H-SAM employs SAM's original decoder to generate a prior probabilistic mask guiding a more intricate decoding process in the second stage. Specifically we propose two key designs: 1) A class-balanced mask-guided self-attention mechanism addressing the unbalanced label distribution enhancing image embedding; 2) A learnable mask cross-attention mechanism spatially modulating the interplay among different image regions based on the prior mask. Moreover the inclusion of a hierarchical pixel decoder in H-SAM enhances its proficiency in capturing fine-grained and localized details. This approach enables SAM to effectively integrate learned medical priors facilitating enhanced adaptation for medical image segmentation with limited samples. Our H-SAM demonstrates a 4.78% improvement in average Dice compared to existing prompt-free SAM variants for multi-organ segmentation using only 10% of 2D slices. Notably without using any unlabeled data H-SAM even outperforms state-of-the-art semi-supervised models relying on extensive unlabeled training data across various medical datasets.

Abrevaya, Anastasios Roussos, Timo Bolkart, Petros Maragos", "abstract": "While existing methods for 3D face reconstruction from in-the-wild images excel at recovering the overall face shape they commonly miss subtle extreme asymmetric or rarely observed expressions. We improve upon these methods with SMIRK (Spatial Modeling for Image-based Reconstruction of Kinesics) which faithfully reconstructs expressive 3D faces from images. We identify two key limitations in existing methods: shortcomings in their self-supervised training formulation and a lack of expression diversity in the training images. For training most methods employ differentiable rendering to compare a predicted face mesh with the input image along with a plethora of additional loss functions. This differentiable rendering loss not only has to provide supervision to optimize for 3D face geometry camera albedo and lighting which is an ill-posed optimization problem but the domain gap between rendering and input image further hinders the learning process. Instead SMIRK replaces the differentiable rendering with a neural rendering module that given the rendered predicted mesh geometry and sparsely sampled pixels of the input image generates a face image. As the neural rendering gets color information from sampled image pixels supervising with neural rendering-based reconstruction loss can focus solely on the geometry. Further it enables us to generate images of the input identity with varying expressions while training. These are then utilized as input to the reconstruction model and used as supervision with ground truth geometry. This effectively augments the training data and enhances the generalization for diverse expressions. Our qualitative quantitative and particularly our perceptual evaluations demonstrate that SMIRK achieves the new state-of-the art performance on accurate expression reconstruction.

A key component in our network is a new multi-level graph convolution network for capturing rich geometric structural features at various scales from local to global. These features are then integrated into the invertible neural network which bijectively maps the latent space to guide the noise disentanglement process. Additionally we employ an invertible monotone operator to model the transformation process effectively enhancing the representation of integrated geometric features. This enhancement allows our network to precisely differentiate between noise factors and the intrinsic clean points in the latent code by projecting them onto separate channels. Both qualitative and quantitative evaluations demonstrate that our method outperforms state-of-the-art methods at various noise levels.

To accurately evaluate the OOD generalization ability it is required that test data information is unavailable.

This paper examines the risks of test data information leakage from two aspects of the current evaluation protocol: supervised pretraining on ImageNet and oracle model selection. We propose modifications to the current protocol that we should employ self-supervised pretraining or train from scratch instead of employing the current supervised pretraining and we should use multiple test domains. These would result in a more precise evaluation of OOD generalization ability. We also rerun the algorithms with the modified protocol and introduce new leaderboards to encourage future research in domain generalization with a fairer comparison."},

Therefore their learning objective is not aligned with the PPS task objective which harms the PPS performance. To solve this and make more accurate PPS predictions we propose Task-Aligned Part-aware Panoptic Segmentation (TAPPS). This method uses a set of shared queries to jointly predict (a) object-level segments and (b) the part-level segments within those same objects. As a result TAPPS learns to predict part-level segments that are linked to individual parent objects aligning the learning objective with the task objective and allowing TAPPS to leverage joint object-part representations.

The recent segment anything model (SAM) has emerged as a powerful tool for extracting advanced semantic priors to enhance IR tasks. However the computational cost of SAM is prohibitive for IR compared to existing smaller IR models. The incorporation of SAM for extracting semantic priors considerably hampers the model inference efficiency. To address this issue we propose a general framework to distill SAM's semantic knowledge to boost exiting IR models without interfering with their inference process. Specifically our proposed framework consists of the semantic priors fusion (SPF) scheme and the semantic priors distillation (SPD) scheme. SPF fuses two kinds of information between the restored image predicted by the original IR model and the semantic mask predicted by SAM for the refined restored image. SPD leverages a self-distillation manner to distill the fused semantic priors to boost the performance of original IR models. Additionallywe design a semantic-guided relation (SGR) module for SPD which ensures semantic feature representation space consistency to fully distill the priors. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our framework across multiple IR models and tasks including deraining deblurring and denoising."},

Recently pre-trained vision transformers combined with prompt tuning have shown promise for overcoming catastrophic forgetting in CL. These approaches rely on a pool of learnable prompts which can be inefficient in sharing knowledge across tasks leading to inferior performance. In addition the lack of fine-grained layer specific prompts does not allow these to fully express the strength of the prompts for CL. We address these limitations by proposing ConvPrompt a novel convolutional prompt creation mechanism that maintains layer-wise shared embeddings enabling both layer-specific learning and better concept transfer across tasks. The intelligent use of convolution enables us to maintain a low parameter overhead without compromising performance. We further leverage Large Language Models to generate fine-grained text descriptions of each category which are used to get task similarity and dynamically decide the number of prompts to be learned. Extensive experiments demonstrate the superiority of ConvPrompt and improves SOTA by 3% with significantly less parameter overhead.

Capturing the four measurements in sequence renders the system slow invariably causing inaccuracies in depth estimates due to motion in the scene or the camera. To mitigate this problem we propose a snapshot Lidar that captures amplitude and phase simultaneously as a single time-of-flight hologram.

To demonstrate the efficacy of the proposed system we design and build a lab prototype and evaluate it under varying scene geometries illumination conditions and compare the reconstructed depth measurements against conventional techniques. We rigorously evaluate the robustness of our system on diverse real-world scenes to show that our technique results in a significant reduction in data bandwidth with minimal loss in reconstruction accuracy.

However existing approaches still struggle with the view-dependent appearance of glossy surfaces especially under complex lighting of indoor environments. Unlike existing methods which typically assume distant lighting like an environment map we propose a learnable Gaussian directional encoding to better model the view-dependent effects under near-field lighting conditions. Importantly our new directional encoding captures the spatially-varying nature of near-field lighting and emulates the behavior of prefiltered environment maps. As a result it enables the efficient evaluation of preconvolved specular color at any 3D location with varying roughness coefficients. We further introduce a data-driven geometry prior that helps alleviate the shape radiance ambiguity in reflection modeling. We show that our Gaussian directional encoding and geometry prior significantly improve the modeling of challenging specular reflections in neural radiance fields which helps decompose appearance into more physically meaningful components."},

Our approach employs a pixel-wise joint re-parameterization of reflectance and normal considering them as a vector of radiances rendered under simulated varying illumination. This re-parameterization enables the seamless integration of reflectance and normal maps as input data in neural volume rendering-based 3D reconstruction while preserving a single optimization objective.

{"title": "NoiseCLR: A Contrastive Learning Approach for Unsupervised Discovery of Interpretable Directions in Diffusion Models", "authors": "Yusuf Dalva, Pinar Yanardag", "abstract": "Generative models have been very popular in the recent years for their image generation capabilities. GAN-based models are highly regarded for their disentangled latent space which is a key feature contributing to their success in controlled image editing. On the other hand diffusion models have emerged as powerful tools for generating high-quality images. However the latent space of diffusion models is not as thoroughly explored or understood. Existing methods that aim to explore the latent space of diffusion models usually relies on text prompts to pinpoint specific semantics. However this approach may be restrictive in areas such as art fashion or specialized fields like medicine where suitable text prompts might not be available or easy to conceive thus limiting the scope of existing work. In this paper we propose an unsupervised method to discover latent semantics in text-to-image diffusion models without relying on text prompts. Our method takes a small set of unlabeled images from specific domains such as faces or cats and a pre-trained diffusion model and discovers diverse semantics in unsupervised fashion using a contrastive learning objective. Moreover the learned directions can be applied simultaneously either within the same domain (such as various types of facial edits) or across different domains (such as applying cat and face edits within the same image) without interfering with each other. Our extensive experiments show that our method achieves highly disentangled edits outperforming existing approaches in both diffusion-based and GAN-based latent space editing methods."},

Recently to build an accurate skeleton-based action recognizer a variety of works have been proposed. Among them some works use large model architectures as backbones of their recognizers to boost the skeleton data representation capability while some other works pre-train their recognizers on external data to enrich the knowledge. In this work we observe that large language models which have been extensively used in various natural language processing tasks generally hold both large model architectures and rich implicit knowledge. Motivated by this we propose a novel LLM-AR framework in which we investigate treating the Large Language Model as an Action Recognizer. In our framework we propose a linguistic projection process to project each input action signal (i.e. each skeleton sequence) into its \"sentence format\" (i.e. an \"action sentence\"). Moreover we also incorporate our framework with several designs to further facilitate this linguistic projection process. Extensive experiments demonstrate the efficacy of our proposed framework."},
{"title": "Communication-Efficient Federated Learning with Accelerated Client Gradient", "authors": "Geeho Kim, Jinkyu Kim, Bohyung Han", "abstract": "Federated learning often suffers from slow and unstable convergence due to the heterogeneous characteristics of participating client datasets. Such a tendency is aggravated when the client participation ratio is low since the information collected from the clients has large variations. To address this challenge we propose a simple but effective federated learning framework which improves the consistency across clients and facilitates the convergence of the server model. This is achieved by making the server broadcast a global model with a lookahead gradient. This strategy enables the proposed approach to convey the projected global update information to participants effectively without additional client memory and extra communication costs. We also regularize local updates by aligning each client with the overshot global model to reduce bias and improve the stability of our algorithm. We provide the theoretical convergence rate of our algorithm and demonstrate remarkable performance gains in terms of accuracy and communication efficiency compared to the state-of-the-art methods especially with low client participation rates.

With the ever-increasing stream of research data collection it would be appealing to autonomously explore patterns and insights from observational data for discovering novel classes of phenotypes and concepts. However in the biomedical domain there are several challenges inherently presented in the cumulated data which hamper the progress of novel class discovery. The non-i.i.d. data distribution accompanied by the severe imbalance among different groups of classes essentially leads to ambiguous and biased semantic representations. In this work we present a geometry-constrained probabilistic modeling treatment to resolve the identified issues. First we propose to parameterize the approximated posterior of instance embedding as a marginal von Mises-Fisher distribution to account for the interference of distributional latent bias. Then we incorporate a suite of critical geometric properties to impose proper constraints on the layout of constructed embedding space which in turn minimizes the uncontrollable risk for unknown class learning and structuring. Furthermore a spectral graph-theoretic method is devised to estimate the number of potential novel classes. It inherits two intriguing merits compared to existent approaches namely high computational efficiency and flexibility for taxonomy-adaptive estimation. Extensive experiments across various biomedical scenarios substantiate the effectiveness and general applicability of our method."},

In this paradigm the emergence of active finetuning arises due to the abundance of large-scale data and costly annotation requirements. Active finetuning involves selecting a subset of data from an unlabeled pool for annotation facilitating subsequent finetuning. However the use of a limited number of training samples can lead to a biased distribution potentially resulting in model overfitting. In this paper we propose a new method called ActiveDC for the active finetuning tasks. Firstly we select samples for annotation by optimizing the distribution similarity between the subset to be selected and the entire unlabeled pool in continuous space. Secondly we calibrate the distribution of the selected samples by exploiting implicit category information in the unlabeled pool. The feature visualization provides an intuitive sense of the effectiveness of our approach to distribution calibration. We conducted extensive experiments on three image classification datasets with different sampling ratios. The results indicate that ActiveDC consistently outperforms the baseline performance in all image classification tasks. The improvement is particularly significant when the sampling ratio is low with performance gains of up to 10%. Our code will be released."},

We use our theory to explain compare and correct previous volumetric representations as well as propose meaningful extensions that lead to improved performance in 3D reconstruction tasks."},

In this paper we present MoDeC a time constraint-aware embodied control framework using the modular model adaptation. We formulate model adaptation to varying operational conditions on resource and time restrictions as dynamic routing on a modular network incorporating these conditions as part of multi-task objectives. Our evaluation across several vision-based embodied environments demonstrates the robustness of MoDeC showing that it outperforms other model adaptation methods in both performance and adherence to time constraints in robotic manipulation and autonomous driving applications."},

Previous methods don't excel in extracting long-range contextual features and overlook the connectivity between discrete pixels. Recently Segment Anything Model (SAM) offers a universal framework for general segmentation tasks. Unfortunately trained with natural images SAM does not obtain the prior knowledge from marine images. In addition the single-position prompt of SAM is very insufficient for prior guidance. To address these issues we propose a novel feature learning framework named Dual-SAM for high-performance MAS. To this end we first introduce a dual structure with SAM's paradigm to enhance feature learning of marine images. Then we propose a Multi-level Coupled Prompt (MCP) strategy to instruct comprehensive underwater prior information and enhance the multi-level features of SAM's encoder with adapters. Subsequently we design a Dilated Fusion Attention Module (DFAM) to progressively integrate multi-level features from SAM's encoder. Finally instead of directly predicting the masks of marine animals we propose a Criss-Cross Connectivity Prediction (C3P) paradigm to capture the inter-connectivity between discrete pixels. With dual decoders it generates pseudo-labels and achieves mutual supervision for complementary feature representations resulting in considerable improvements over previous techniques.

We employ entropy-constrained training to jointly optimize our model for rate and distortion and demonstrate that T-NeRV can thereby automatically adjust this lever during training effectively fine-tuning itself to the target content. We evaluate T-NeRV on the UVG dataset where it achieves state-of-the-art results on the video representation task outperforming previous works by up to 3dB PSNR on challenging high-motion sequences.

GAN inversion is a crucial step that seeks the latent code to reconstruct input images or videos subsequently enabling diverse editing tasks through manipulation of this latent code. However a model pre-trained on a particular dataset (e.g. FFHQ) often has difficulty reconstructing images with out-of-distribution (OOD) objects such as faces with heavy make-up or occluding objects. We address this issue by explicitly modeling OOD objects from the input in 3D-aware GANs. Our core idea is to represent the image using two individual neural radiance fields: one for the in-distribution content and the other for the out-of-distribution object. The final reconstruction is achieved by optimizing the composition of these two radiance fields with carefully designed regularization. We demonstrate that our explicit decomposition alleviates the inherent trade-off between reconstruction fidelity and editability. We evaluate reconstruction accuracy and editability of our method on challenging real face images and videos and showcase favorable results against other baselines."},

The task of synthesizing novel views from a single reference image is highly ill-posed by nature as there exist multiple plausible explanations for unobserved areas. To address this issue we incorporate strong priors in form of monocular depth predictors and video-diffusion models. Monocular depth enables us to condition our model on warped reference images for the target views increasing geometric stability. The video-diffusion prior provides a strong proxy for 3D scenes allowing the model to learn continuous and pixel-accurate correspondences across generated images. In contrast to approaches relying on autoregressive image generation that are prone to drifts and error accumulation MultiDiff jointly synthesizes a sequence of frames yielding high-quality and multi-view consistent results -- even for long-term scene generation with large camera movements while reducing inference time by an order of magnitude. For additional consistency and image quality improvements we introduce a novel structured noise distribution.

Mainstream approaches employ bidirectional feature propagation spatio-temporal transformers or a combination of both to extract information from the video sequence. However limitations in memory and computational resources constraints the temporal window length of the spatio-temporal transformer preventing the extraction of longer temporal contextual information from the video sequence. Additionally bidirectional feature propagation is highly sensitive to inaccurate optical flow in blurry frames leading to error accumulation during the propagation process. To address these issues we propose BSSTNet Blur-aware Spatio-temporal Sparse Transformer Network. It introduces the blur map which converts the originally dense attention into a sparse form enabling a more extensive utilization of information throughout the entire video sequence. Specifically BSSTNet (1) uses a longer temporal window in the transformer leveraging information from more distant frames to restore the blurry pixels in the current frame. (2) introduces bidirectional feature propagation guided by blur maps which reduces error accumulation caused by the blur frame. The experimental results demonstrate the proposed BSSTNet outperforms the state-of-the-art methods on the GoPro and DVD datasets."},

Unlike less-interacted motions closely interacted motions contain frequently occurring inter-human occlusions which pose significant challenges to existing capturing algorithms. To address this problem our key observation is that close physical interactions between two subjects typically happen under very specific situations (e.g. handshake hug etc.) and such situational contexts contain strong prior semantics to help infer the poses of occluded joints. In this spirit we introduce reaction priors which are invertible neural networks that bi-directionally model the pose probability distributions of one person given the pose of the other. The learned reaction priors are then incorporated into a query-based pose estimator which is a decoder-only Transformer with self-attentions on both intra-joint and inter-joint relationships. We demonstrate that our design achieves considerably higher performance than previous methods on multiple benchmarks. What's more as existing datasets lack sufficient cases of close human-human interactions we also build a new dataset called Dual-Human to better evaluate different methods. Dual-Human contains around 2k sequences of closely interacted two-person motions each with synthetic multi-view renderings contact annotations and text descriptions.

Despite the strong performance of Pre-Trained Models (PTMs) in CIL a critical issue persists: learning new classes often results in the overwriting of old ones. Excessive modification of the network causes forgetting while minimal adjustments lead to an inadequate fit for new classes. As a result it is desired to figure out a way of efficient model updating without harming former knowledge. In this paper we propose ExpAndable Subspace Ensemble (EASE) for PTM-based CIL. To enable model updating without conflict we train a distinct lightweight adapter module for each new task aiming to create task-specific subspaces. These adapters span a high-dimensional feature space enabling joint decision-making across multiple subspaces. As data evolves the expanding subspaces render the old class classifiers incompatible with new-stage spaces. Correspondingly we design a semantic-guided prototype complement strategy that synthesizes old classes' new features without using any old class instance.

We propose the anatomical implicit face model; an ensemble of implicit neural networks that jointly learn to model the facial anatomy and the skin surface with high-fidelity and can readily be used as a drop in replacement to conventional blendshape models. Given an arbitrary set of skin surface meshes of an actor and only a neutral shape with estimated skull and jaw bones our method can recover a dense anatomical substructure which constrains every point on the facial surface.

Nevertheless achieving dense point clouds to accurately represent texture details poses a challenge due to limited computational resources. To address these challenges we propose an efficient octree-based diffusion pipeline called TexOct.

We utilize an octree structure to efficiently represent this point cloud. Additionally we introduce an innovative octree-based diffusion model that leverages the denoising capabilities of the Denoising Diffusion Probabilistic Model (DDPM).

Many state-of-the-art closed-set TTA methods perform poorly when applied to open-set scenarios which can be attributed to the inaccurate estimation of data distribution and model confidence. To address these issues we propose a simple but effective framework called unified entropy optimization (UniEnt) which is capable of simultaneously adapting to covariate-shifted in-distribution (csID) data and detecting covariate-shifted out-of-distribution (csOOD) data. Specifically UniEnt first mines pseudo-csID and pseudo-csOOD samples from test data followed by entropy minimization on the pseudo-csID data and entropy maximization on the pseudo-csOOD data. Furthermore we introduce UniEnt+ to alleviate the noise caused by hard data partition leveraging sample-level confidence. Extensive experiments on CIFAR benchmarks and Tiny-ImageNet-C show the superiority of our framework. The code is available at https://github.com/gaozhengqing/UniEnt."},
{"title": "Implicit Motion Function", "authors": "Yue Gao, Jiahao Li, Lei Chu, Yan Lu", "abstract": "Recent advancements in video modeling extensively rely on optical flow to represent the relationships across frames but this approach often lacks efficiency and fails to model the probability of the intrinsic motion of objects. In addition conventional encoder-decoder frameworks in video processing focus on modeling the correlation in the encoder leading to limited generative capabilities and redundant intermediate representations. To address these challenges this paper proposes a novel Implicit Motion Function (IMF) method. Our approach utilizes a low-dimensional latent token as the implicit representation along with the use of cross-attention to implicitly model the correlation between frames. This enables the implicit modeling of temporal correlations and understanding of object motions. Our method not only improves sparsity and efficiency in representation but also explores the generative capabilities of the decoder by integrating correlation modeling within it. The IMF framework facilitates video editing and other generative tasks by allowing the direct manipulation of latent tokens. We validate the effectiveness of IMF through extensive experiments on multiple video tasks demonstrating superior performance in terms of reconstructed video quality compression efficiency and generation ability."},

Recent efforts have sought to harness vision-language models like CLIP for open-set semantic reasoning yet these methods struggle to distinguish between objects of the same categories and rely on specific prompts that are not universally applicable. In this paper we introduce SAI3D a novel zero-shot 3D instance segmentation approach that synergistically leverages geometric priors and semantic cues derived from Segment Anything Model (SAM). Our method partitions a 3D scene into geometric primitives which are then progressively merged into 3D instance segmentations that are consistent with the multi-view SAM masks. Moreover we design a hierarchical region-growing algorithm with a dynamic thresholding mechanism which largely improves the robustness of fine-grained 3D scene parsing. Empirical evaluations on ScanNet Matterport3D and the more challenging ScanNet++ datasets demonstrate the superiority of our approach. Notably SAI3D outperforms existing open-vocabulary baselines and even surpasses fully-supervised methods in class-agnostic segmentation on ScanNet++.

{"title": "Consistency and Uncertainty: Identifying Unreliable Responses From Black-Box Vision-Language Models for Selective Visual Question Answering", "authors": "Zaid Khan, Yun Fu", "abstract": "The goal of selective prediction is to allow an a model to abstain when it may not be able to deliver a reliable prediction which is important in safety-critical contexts. Existing approaches to selective prediction typically require access to the internals of a model require retraining a model or study only unimodal models. However the most powerful models (e.g. GPT-4) are typically only available as black boxes with inaccessible internals are not retrainable by end-users and are frequently used for multimodal tasks. We study the possibility of selective prediction for vision-language models in a realistic black-box setting. We propose using the principle of neighborhood consistency to identify unreliable responses from a black-box vision-language model in question answering tasks. We hypothesize that given only a visual question and model response the consistency of the model's responses over the neighborhood of a visual question will indicate reliability. It is impossible to directly sample neighbors in feature space in a black-box setting. Instead we show that it is possible to use a smaller proxy model to approximately sample from the neighborhood. We find that neighborhood consistency can be used to identify model responses to visual questions that are likely unreliable even in adversarial settings or settings that are out-of-distribution to the proxy model."},
{"title": "Learning to Select Views for Efficient Multi-View Understanding", "authors": "Yunzhong Hou, Stephen Gould, Liang Zheng", "abstract": "Multiple camera view (multi-view) setups have proven useful in many computer vision applications. However the high computational cost associated with multiple views creates a significant challenge for end devices with limited computational resources. In modern CPU pipelining breaks a longer job into steps and enables parallelism over sequential steps from multiple jobs. Inspired by this we study selective view pipelining for efficient multi-view understanding which breaks computation of multiple views into steps and only computes the most helpful views/steps in a parallel manner for the best efficiency. To this end we use reinforcement learning to learn a very light view selection module that analyzes the target object or scenario from initial views and selects the next-best-view for recognition or detection for pipeline computation. Experimental results on multi-view classification and detection tasks show that our approach achieves promising performance while using only 2 or 3 out of N available views significantly reducing computational costs while maintaining parallelism over GPU through selective view pipelining."},

However most of the existing MLLMs mainly adopt vision encoders pretrained on coarsely aligned image-text pairs leading to insufficient extraction and reasoning of visual knowledge. To address this issue we devise a dual-Level vIsual knOwledge eNhanced Multimodal Large Language Model (LION) which empowers the MLLM by injecting visual knowledge in two levels. 1) Progressive incorporation of fine-grained spatial-aware visual knowledge. We design a vision aggregator cooperated with region-level vision-language (VL) tasks to incorporate fine-grained spatial-aware visual knowledge into the MLLM. To alleviate the conflict between image-level and region-level VL tasks during incorporation we devise a dedicated stage-wise instruction-tuning strategy with mixture-of-adapters. This progressive incorporation scheme contributes to the mutual promotion between these two kinds of VL tasks. 2) Soft prompting of high-level semantic visual evidence. We facilitate the MLLM with high-level semantic visual evidence by leveraging diverse image tags. To mitigate the potential influence caused by imperfect predicted tags we propose a soft prompting method by embedding a learnable token into the tailored text instruction. Comprehensive experiments on several multi-modal benchmarks demonstrate the superiority of our model (e.g. improvement of 5% accuracy on VSR and 3% CIDEr on TextCaps over InstructBLIP 5% accuracy on RefCOCOg over Kosmos-2)."},

Mitchel, Carlos Esteves, Ameesh Makadia", "abstract": "We introduce a framework for intrinsic latent diffusion models operating directly on the surfaces of 3D shapes with the goal of synthesizing high-quality textures. Our approach is underpinned by two contributions: Field Latents a latent representation encoding textures as discrete vector fields on the mesh vertices and Field Latent Diffusion Models which learn to denoise a diffusion process in the learned latent space on the surface. We consider a single-textured-mesh paradigm where our models are trained to generate variations of a given texture on a mesh. We show the synthesized textures are of superior fidelity compared those from existing single-textured-mesh generative models. Our models can also be adapted for user-controlled editing tasks such as inpainting and label-guided generation. The efficacy of our approach is due in part to the equivariance of our proposed framework under isometries allowing our models to seamlessly reproduce details across locally similar regions and opening the door to a notion of generative texture transfer.

The adaptation strategies can be typically categorized into three paradigms: zero-shot adaptation few-shot adaptation and the recently-proposed training-free few-shot adaptation. Most existing approaches are tailored for a specific setting and can only cater to one or two of these paradigms. In this paper we introduce a versatile adaptation approach that can effectively work under all three settings. Specifically we propose the dual memory networks that comprise dynamic and static memory components. The static memory caches training data knowledge enabling training-free few-shot adaptation while the dynamic memory preserves historical test features online during the testing process allowing for the exploration of additional data insights beyond the training set. This novel capability enhances model performance in the few-shot setting and enables model usability in the absence of training data. The two memory networks employ the same flexible memory interactive strategy which can operate in a training-free mode and can be further enhanced by incorporating learnable projection layers. Our approach is tested across 11 datasets under the three task settings. Remarkably in the zero-shot scenario it outperforms existing methods by over 3% and even shows superior results against methods utilizing external training data. Additionally our method exhibits robust performance against natural distribution shifts."},

To address these limitations we propose a new semantic correspondence estimation method that supplements state-of-the-art self-supervised features with 3D understanding via a weak geometric spherical prior. Compared to more involved 3D pipelines our model provides a simple and effective way of injecting informative geometric priors into the learned representation while requiring only weak viewpoint information.

In this paper we concentrate on generating a real-outdoor scene through learning a diffusion model on a real-world outdoor dataset. In contrast to synthetic data real-outdoor datasets often contain more empty spaces due to sensor limitations causing challenges in learning real-outdoor distributions. To address this issue we exploit a triplane representation as a proxy form of scene distributions to be learned by our diffusion model.

In experimental results we demonstrate that our triplane diffusion model shows meaningful generation results compared with existing work in a real-outdoor dataset SemanticKITTI. We also show our triplane manipulation facilitates seamlessly adding removing or modifying objects within a scene. Further it also enables the expansion of scenes toward a city-level scale.

Recently the community has witnessed the emergence of numerous large-scale pretrained foundation models.

By using independent trainable blocks for personalization the rich prior of a base restoration model can be exploited to its fullest. To avoid the model relying on parts of identity left in the conditioning low-quality images a generative regularizer is employed.

However the challenge lies in the laborious and expensive process of curating a large and accurately matched multimodal dataset. Commonly sourced from the Internet these datasets often suffer from a significant presence of mismatched data impairing the performance of matching models. To address this problem we introduce a novel regularization approach named Equivariant Similarity Consistency (ESC) which can facilitate robust clean and noisy data separation and improve the training for cross-modal matching. Intuitively our method posits that the semantic variations caused by image changes should be proportional to those caused by text changes for any two matched samples. Accordingly we first calculate the ESC by comparing image and text semantic variations between a set of elaborated anchor points and other undivided training data. Then pairs with high ESC are filtered out as noisy correspondence pairs. We implement our method by combining the ESC with a traditional hinge-based triplet loss. Extensive experiments on three widely used datasets including Flickr30K MS-COCO and Conceptual Captions verify the effectiveness of our method."},

This is mainly due to the lack of large-scale real-world datasets and existing self-supervised methods are limited by indirect loss and occlusions resulting in fuzzy outcomes. To address this challenge we introduce a novel optical flow training framework: automatic data factory (ADF). ADF only requires RGB images as input to effectively train the optical flow network on the target data domain. Specifically we use advanced NeRF technology to reconstruct scenes from photo groups collected by a monocular camera and then calculate optical flow labels between camera pose pairs based on the rendering results. To eliminate erroneous labels caused by defects in the scene reconstructed by NeRF we screened the generated labels from multiple aspects such as optical flow matching accuracy radiation field confidence and depth consistency. The filtered labels can be directly used for network supervision. Experimentally the generalization ability of ADF on KITTI surpasses existing self-supervised optical flow and monocular scene flow algorithms. In addition ADF achieves impressive results in real-world zero-point generalization evaluations and surpasses most supervised methods."},

Although many recent studies have shown the remarkable improvement in human mesh reconstruction it is still difficult to generate accurate meshes when person-to-person occlusion occurs due to the ambiguity of who a body part belongs to. To address this problem we propose an instance-aware contrastive learning scheme. Specifically joint features belonging to the target human are trained to be proximate with the anchor feature (i.e. feature extracted from the body center position). On the other hand anchor features of different human instances are forced to be far apart so that joint features of each person can be clearly distinguished from others. By interpreting the joint possession based on such contrastive learning scheme the proposed method easily understands the spatial occupancy of body parts for each person in a given image thus can reconstruct reliable human meshes even with severely overlapped cases between multiple persons. Experimental results on benchmark datasets demonstrate the robustness of the proposed method compared to previous approaches under person-to-person occlusions.

Existing methods typically align low dynamic range sequences using optical flow or attention mechanism for deghosting. However they often struggle to handle large complex motions and are computationally expensive. To address these challenges we propose a robust and efficient flow estimator tailored for real-time HDR video reconstruction named HDRFlow. HDRFlow has three novel designs: an HDR-domain alignment loss (HALoss) an efficient flow network with a multi-size large kernel (MLK) and a new HDR flow training scheme. The HALoss supervises our flow network to learn an HDR-oriented flow for accurate alignment in saturated and dark regions. The MLK can effectively model large motions at a negligible cost. In addition we incorporate synthetic data Sintel into our training dataset utilizing both its provided forward flow and backward flow generated by us to supervise our flow network enhancing our performance in large motion regions. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our HDRFlow outperforms previous methods on standard benchmarks. To the best of our knowledge HDRFlow is the first real-time HDR video reconstruction method for video sequences captured with alternating exposures capable of processing 720p resolution inputs at 25ms."},

Such capability would be valuable for many application domains in vision xR robotics and HCI. We introduce structured polarization for invisible depth and reflectance sensing (SPIDeRS) the first depth and reflectance sensing method using patterns of polarized light. The key idea is to modulate the angle of linear polarization (AoLP) of projected light at each pixel. The use of polarization makes it invisible and lets us recover not only depth but also directly surface normals and even reflectance. We implement SPIDeRS with a liquid crystal spatial light modulator (SLM) and a polarimetric camera. We derive a novel method for robustly extracting the projected structured polarization pattern from the polarimetric object appearance. We evaluate the effectiveness of SPIDeRS by applying it to a number of real-world objects. The results show that our method successfully reconstructs object shapes of various materials and is robust to diffuse reflection and ambient light. We also demonstrate relighting using recovered surface normals and reflectance. We believe SPIDeRS opens a new avenue of polarization use in visual sensing."},

Conventionally they use 4x4 patch embeddings and a 4-stage structure at the macro level while utilizing sophisticated attention with multi-head configuration at the micro level. This paper aims to address computational redundancy at all design levels in a memory-efficient manner. We discover that using larger-stride patchify stem not only reduces memory access costs but also achieves competitive performance by leveraging token representations with reduced spatial redundancy from the early stages. Furthermore our preliminary analyses suggest that attention layers in the early stages can be substituted with convolutions and several attention heads in the latter stages are computationally redundant. To handle this we introduce a single-head attention module that inherently prevents head redundancy and simultaneously boosts accuracy by parallelly combining global and local information. Building upon our solutions we introduce SHViT a Single-Head Vision Transformer that obtains the state-of-the-art speed-accuracy tradeoff. For example on ImageNet-1k our SHViT-S4 is 3.3x 8.1x and 2.4x faster than MobileViTv2x1.0 on GPU CPU and iPhone12 mobile device respectively while being 1.3% more accurate.

In this work we investigate the relative quality of samples produced by the teacher text-to-image diffusion model and its distilled student version. As our main empirical finding we discover that a noticeable portion of student samples exhibit superior fidelity compared to the teacher ones despite the approximate nature of the student. Based on this finding we propose an adaptive collaboration between student and teacher diffusion models for effective text-to-image synthesis. Specifically the distilled model produces an initial image sample and then an oracle decides whether it needs further improvements with the teacher model. Extensive experiments demonstrate that the designed pipeline surpasses state-of-the-art text-to-image alternatives for various inference budgets in terms of human preference.

In contrast to the prevalent NeRF-based approaches hampered by slow training and rendering speeds our approach harnesses recent advancements in point-based 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS). Specifically a novel Dual-Domain Deformation Model (DDDM) is proposed to explicitly model attribute deformations of each Gaussian point where the time-dependent residual of each attribute is captured by a polynomial fitting in the time domain and a Fourier series fitting in the frequency domain. The proposed DDDM is capable of modeling complex scene deformations across long video footage eliminating the need for training separate 3DGS for each frame or introducing an additional implicit neural field to model 3D dynamics. Moreover the explicit deformation modeling for discretized Gaussian points ensures ultra-fast training and rendering of a 4D scene which is comparable to the original 3DGS designed for static 3D reconstruction. Our proposed approach showcases a substantial efficiency improvement achieving a 5xfaster training speed compared to the per-frame 3DGS modeling.

Prominent among these are methods based on Score Distillation Sampling (SDS) and the adaptation of diffusion models in the 3D domain. Despite their progress these techniques often face limitations due to slow optimization or rendering processes leading to extensive training and optimization times. In this paper we introduce a novel approach for single-view reconstruction that efficiently generates a 3D model from a single image via feed-forward inference. Our method utilizes two transformer-based networks namely a point decoder and a triplane decoder to reconstruct 3D objects using a hybrid Triplane-Gaussian intermediate representation. This hybrid representation strikes a balance achieving a faster rendering speed compared to implicit representations while simultaneously delivering superior rendering quality than explicit representations. The point decoder is designed for generating point clouds from single images offering an explicit representation which is then utilized by the triplane decoder to query Gaussian features for each point. This design choice addresses the challenges associated with directly regressing explicit 3D Gaussian attributes characterized by their non-structural nature. Subsequently the 3D Gaussians are decoded by an MLP to enable rapid rendering through splatting. Both decoders are built upon a scalable transformer-based architecture and have been efficiently trained on large-scale 3D datasets. The evaluations conducted on both synthetic datasets and real-world images demonstrate that our method not only achieves higher quality but also ensures a faster runtime in comparison to previous state-of-the-art techniques.

Unfortunately existing large vision-language alignment (VLA) models e.g. CLIP struggle with both aspects so cannot be directly used for this task. To mitigate this gap we leverage large foundation models to disentangle both images and texts into triplets in the format of (subject predicate object). After that grounding is accomplished by calculating the structural similarity matrix between visual and textual triplets with a VLA model and subsequently propagate it to an instance-level similarity matrix. Furthermore to equip VLA models with the ability of relationship understanding we design a triplet-matching objective to fine-tune the VLA models on a collection of curated dataset containing abundant entity relationships. Experiments demonstrate that our visual grounding performance increase of up to 19.5% over the SOTA zero-shot model on RefCOCO/+/g.

However when adapting VLMs to specialized domains such as remote sensing and medical imaging domain prompt learning remains underexplored. While large-scale domain-specific foundation models can help tackle this challenge their concentration on a single vision level makes it challenging to prompt both vision and language modalities. To overcome this we propose to leverage domain-specific knowledge from domain-specific foundation models to transfer the robust recognition ability of VLMs from generalized to specialized domains using quaternion networks. Specifically the proposed method involves using domain-specific vision features from domain-specific foundation models to guide the transformation of generalized contextual embeddings from the language branch into a specialized space within the quaternion networks. Moreover we present a hierarchical approach that generates vision prompt features by analyzing intermodal relationships between hierarchical language prompt features and domain-specific vision features.

However the former methods typically predict solely static skinning weights which perform poorly for highly articulated poses and the latter ones either require dense 3D character scans in different poses or cannot generate an explicit mesh with vertex correspondence over time. To address these challenges we propose a fully automated approach for creating a fully rigged character with pose-dependent skinning weights which can be solely learned from multi-view video. Therefore we first acquire a rigged template which is then statically skinned. Next a coordinate-based MLP learns a skinning weights field parameterized over the position in a canonical pose space and the respective pose. Moreover we introduce our pose- and view-dependent appearance field allowing us to differentiably render and supervise the posed mesh using multi-view imagery.

Though diverse efficient attention mechanism designs have addressed the intensive computations associated with using transformers they often involve redundant information and noisy interactions from irrelevant regions by considering all available tokens. In this work we propose an Adaptive Sparse Transformer (AST) to mitigate the noisy interactions of irrelevant areas and remove feature redundancy in both spatial and channel domains. AST comprises two core designs i.e. an Adaptive Sparse Self-Attention (ASSA) block and a Feature Refinement Feed-forward Network (FRFN). Specifically ASSA is adaptively computed using a two-branch paradigm where the sparse branch is introduced to filter out the negative impacts of low query-key matching scores for aggregating features while the dense one ensures sufficient information flow through the network for learning discriminative representations. Meanwhile FRFN employs an enhance-and-ease scheme to eliminate feature redundancy in channels enhancing the restoration of clear latent images.

Dominant approaches rely heavily on model capacity to remove blurring by reconstructing residual from blurry observation in feature space.

In this paper we propose a novel real-world deblurring filtering model called the Motion-adaptive Separable Collaborative (MISC) Filter. In particular we use a motion estimation network to capture motion information from neighborhoods thereby adaptively estimating spatially-variant motion flow mask kernels weights and offsets to obtain the MISC Filter. The MISC Filter first aligns the motion-induced blurring patterns to the motion middle along the predicted flow direction and then collaboratively filters the aligned image through the predicted kernels weights and offsets to generate the output. This design can handle more generalized and complex motion in a spatially differentiated manner. Furthermore we analyze the relationships between the motion estimation network and the residual reconstruction network.

These motion patches created by dividing and sorting skeleton joints based on body parts in motion sequences are robust to varying skeleton structures and can be regarded as color image patches in ViT. We find that transfer learning with pre-trained weights of ViT obtained through training with 2D image data can boost the performance of motion analysis presenting a promising direction for addressing the issue of limited motion data. Our extensive experiments show that the proposed motion patches used jointly with ViT achieve state-of-the-art performance in the benchmarks of text-to-motion retrieval and other novel challenging tasks such as cross-skeleton recognition zero-shot motion classification and human interaction recognition which are currently impeded by the lack of data."},

However existing methods for model adaptation usually update all model parameters i.e. full fine-tuning paradigm which is inefficient as it relies on high computational costs (e.g. training GPU memory) and massive storage space. In this paper we aim to study parameter-efficient transfer learning for point cloud analysis with an ideal trade-off between task performance and parameter efficiency. To achieve this goal we freeze the parameters of the default pre-trained models and then propose the Dynamic Adapter which generates a dynamic scale for each token considering the token significance to the downstream task. We further seamlessly integrate Dynamic Adapter with Prompt Tuning (DAPT) by constructing Internal Prompts capturing the instance-specific features for interaction. Extensive experiments conducted on five challenging datasets demonstrate that the proposed DAPT achieves superior performance compared to the full fine-tuning counterparts while significantly reducing the trainable parameters and training GPU memory by 95% and 35% respectively.

This algorithm works by transforming a blurry input image which is challenging to deblur into another blurry image that is more amenable to deblurring. The transformation process from one blurry state to another leverages unpaired data consisting of sharp and blurry images captured by the target camera device. Learning this blur-to-blur transformation is inherently simpler than direct blur-to-sharp conversion as it primarily involves modifying blur patterns rather than the intricate task of reconstructing fine image details. The efficacy of the proposed approach has been demonstrated through comprehensive experiments on various benchmarks where it significantly outperforms state-of-the-art methods both quantitatively and qualitatively.

A novel approach called PostureHMR is proposed to leverage a multi-step diffusion-style process which converts this task into a posture transformation from an SMPL T-pose mesh to the target mesh. To inject the learning process of posture transformation with the physical structure of the human body model a kinematics-based forward process is proposed to interpolate the intermediate state with pose and shape decomposition. Moreover a mesh-to-posture (M2P) decoder is designed by combining the input of 3D and 2D mesh constraints estimated from the image to model the posture changes in the reverse process. It mitigates the difficulties of posture change learning directly from RGB pixels. To overcome the limitation of pixel-level misalignment of modeling results with the input image a new trimap-based rendering loss is designed to highlight the areas with poor recognition. Experiments conducted on three widely used datasets demonstrate that the proposed approach outperforms the state-of-the-art methods."},

Cutting-edge solutions start to explore the benefits of pre-trained models and mainly follow the fixed paradigm of solely training an attached classifier e.g. combining frozen CLIP-ViT with a learnable linear layer in UniFD. However our analysis shows that such a fixed paradigm is prone to yield detectors with insufficient learning regarding forgery representations. We attribute the key challenge to the lack of forgery adaptation and present a novel forgery-aware adaptive transformer approach namely FatFormer. Based on the pre-trained vision-language spaces of CLIP FatFormer introduces two core designs for the adaption to build generalized forgery representations. First motivated by the fact that both image and frequency analysis are essential for synthetic image detection we develop a forgery-aware adapter to adapt image features to discern and integrate local forgery traces within image and frequency domains. Second we find that considering the contrastive objectives between adapted image features and text prompt embeddings a previously overlooked aspect results in a nontrivial generalization improvement. Accordingly we introduce language-guided alignment to supervise the forgery adaptation with image and text prompts in FatFormer. Experiments show that by coupling these two designs our approach tuned on 4-class ProGAN data attains a remarkable detection performance achieving an average of 98% accuracy to unseen GANs and surprisingly generalizes to unseen diffusion models with 95% accuracy."},

One reason is that they make use of volume rendering thus requiring many samples (and model queries) per ray at render time. Although this representation is flexible and easy to optimize most real-world objects can be modeled more efficiently with surfaces instead of volumes requiring far fewer samples per ray. This observation has spurred considerable progress in surface representations such as signed distance functions but these may struggle to model semi-opaque and thin structures. We propose a method HybridNeRF that leverages the strengths of both representations by rendering most objects as surfaces while modeling the (typically) small fraction of challenging regions volumetrically. We evaluate HybridNeRF against the challenging Eyeful Tower dataset along with other commonly used view synthesis datasets. When comparing to state-of-the-art baselines including recent rasterization-based approaches we improve error rates by 15-30% while achieving real-time framerates (at least 36 FPS) for virtual-reality resolutions (2K x 2K)."},

The Unified Parkinson's Disease Rating Scale (UPDRS) is the gold-standard for assessing motor symptom severity yet its manual scoring criteria are vague and subjective resulting in coarse and noisy clinical assessments. Machine learning approaches have the potential to modernize PD symptom assessments by making them more quantitative objective and scalable. However the lack of benchmark video datasets for PD motor exams hinders model development. Here we introduce the TULIP dataset to bridge this gap. TULIP emphasizes precision and comprehensiveness comprising multi-view video recordings (6 cameras) of all 25 UPDRS motor exam components together with ratings by 3 clinical experts in a cohort of Parkinson's patients and healthy controls. The multi-view recordings enable 3D reconstructions of body movement that better capture disease signatures than more conventional 2D methods. Using the dataset we establish a baseline model for predicting UPDRS scores from 3D poses illustrating how existing diagnostics could be automated. Looking ahead TULIP could aid the development of new precision diagnostics that transcend UPDRS scores providing a deeper understanding of PD and its potential treatments."},

However its application in video camouflaged object detection (VCOD) encounters challenges chiefly stemming from the overlooked temporal-spatial associations and the unreliability of user-provided prompts for camouflaged objects that are difficult to discern with the naked eye. To tackle the above issues we endow SAM with keen eyes and propose the Temporal-spatial Prompt SAM (TSP-SAM) a novel approach tailored for VCOD via an ingenious prompted learning scheme. Firstly motion-driven self-prompt learning is employed to capture the camouflaged object thereby bypassing the need for user-provided prompts. With the detected subtle motion cues across consecutive video frames the overall movement of the camouflaged object is captured for more precise spatial localization. Subsequently to eliminate the prompt bias resulting from inter-frame discontinuities the long-range consistency within the video sequences is taken into account to promote the robustness of the self-prompts. It is also injected into the encoder of SAM to enhance the representational capabilities. Extensive experimental results on two benchmarks demonstrate that the proposed TSP-SAM achieves a significant improvement over the state-of-the-art methods. With the mIoU metric increasing by 7.8% and 9.6% TSP-SAM emerges as a groundbreaking step forward in the field of VCOD."},

Existing methods heavily rely on supervised learning using abundant 3D labels typically obtained through expensive and labor-intensive annotation on LiDAR point clouds. To tackle this problem we propose a novel weakly supervised 3D object detection framework named VSRD (Volumetric Silhouette Rendering for Detection) to train 3D object detectors without any 3D supervision but only weak 2D supervision. VSRD consists of multi-view 3D auto-labeling and subsequent training of monocular 3D object detectors using the pseudo labels generated in the auto-labeling stage. In the auto-labeling stage we represent the surface of each instance as a signed distance field (SDF) and render its silhouette as an instance mask through our proposed instance-aware volumetric silhouette rendering. To directly optimize the 3D bounding boxes through rendering we decompose the SDF of each instance into the SDF of a cuboid and the residual distance field (RDF) that represents the residual from the cuboid. This mechanism enables us to optimize the 3D bounding boxes in an end-to-end manner by comparing the rendered instance masks with the ground truth instance masks. The optimized 3D bounding boxes serve as effective training data for 3D object detection. We conduct extensive experiments on the KITTI-360 dataset demonstrating that our method outperforms the existing weakly supervised 3D object detection methods.

Nevertheless the abundant visual clues are not sufficiently exploited in most existing methods. On the vision side most existing approaches only use the last feature of the vision tower without using the low-level features. On the language side most existing methods only introduce shallow vision-language interactions. In this paper we present a vision-inspired vision-language connection module dubbed as VIVL which efficiently exploits the vision cue for VL models. To take advantage of the lowerlevel information from the vision tower a feature pyramid extractor (FPE) is introduced to combine features from different intermediate layers which enriches the visual cue with negligible parameters and computation overhead. To enhance VL interactions we propose deep vision-conditioned prompts (DVCP) that allows deep interactions of vision and language features efficiently. Our VIVL exceeds the previous state-of-the-art method by 18.1 CIDEr when training from scratch on the COCO caption task which greatly improves the data efficiency. When used as a plug-in module VIVL consistently improves the performance for various backbones and VL frameworks delivering new state-of-the-art results on multiple benchmarks e.g. NoCaps and VQAv2."},

Existing methods that attempt to address these problems mostly do not tend to address the fundamental cause behind these problems which is the distributional discrepancies and hence achieve sub-optimal results. In this paper we propose a particle filtering framework that can effectively address both problems by explicitly reducing the distributional discrepancies. Specifically our method relies on a set of external guidance including a small set of real images and a pre-trained object detector to gauge the distribution gap and then design the resampling weight accordingly to correct the gap. Experiments show that our methods can effectively correct missing object errors and improve image quality in various image generation tasks.

Previous works either rely on local matching between features of support and query samples or require support keypoint identifier. The former is prone to overfitting due to its sensitivity to sparse samples while the latter is impractical for the open-world nature of the task. To overcome these limitations we propose ESCAPE - a Bayesian framework that learns a prior over the features of keypoints. The prior can be expressed as a mixture of super-keypoints each being a high-level abstract keypoint that captures the statistics of semantically related keypoints from different categories. We estimate the super-keypoints from base categories and use them in adaptation to novel categories. The adaptation to an unseen category involves two steps: first we match each novel keypoint to a related super-keypoint; and second we transfer the knowledge encoded in the matched super-keypoints to the novel keypoints. For the first step we propose a learnable matching network to capture the relationship between the novel keypoints and the super-keypoints resulting in a more reliable matching. ESCAPE mitigates overfitting by directly transferring learned knowledge to novel categories while it does not use keypoint identifiers. We achieve state-of-the-art performance on the standard MP-100 benchmark."},

An attribute embedding space spanned by the target-related attributes embeddings is also introduced to infer the disentangled task-specific direction. Next we train a cross-modal latent mapping network conditioned on the derived difference of 3D representation to infer a correct vector in the latent space of StyleGAN.Thiscorrection vector learning design can accurately transfer the attribute manipulation on 3D images to 2D images.

While the cross-attention mechanism with global spatial interactions appears promising it only capture second-order spatial interactions neglecting higher-order interactions in both spatial and channel dimensions. This limitation hampers the exploitation of synergies between multi-modalities. To bridge this gap we introduce a Synergistic High-order Interaction Paradigm (SHIP) designed to systematically investigate spatial fine-grained and global statistics collaborations between infrared and visible images across two fundamental dimensions: 1) Spatial dimension: we construct spatial fine-grained interactions through element-wise multiplication mathematically equivalent to global interactions and then foster high-order formats by iteratively aggregating and evolving complementary information enhancing both efficiency and flexibility. 2) Channel dimension: expanding on channel interactions with first-order statistics (mean) we devise high-order channel interactions to facilitate the discernment of inter-dependencies between source images based on global statistics. Harnessing high-order interactions significantly enhances our model's ability to exploit multi-modal synergies leading in superior performance over state-of-the-art alternatives as shown through comprehensive experiments across various benchmarks."},

We identify two major problems in the OSDA-SS scenario as follows: 1) the existing UDA methods struggle to predict the exact boundary of the unknown classes and 2) they fail to accurately predict the shape of the unknown classes. To address these issues we propose Boundary and Unknown Shape-Aware open-set domain adaptation coined BUS. Our BUS can accurately discern the boundaries between known and unknown classes in a contrastive manner using a novel dilation-erosion-based contrastive loss.

In the computer vision community PEFT has shown effectiveness in image classification but little research has studied its ability for image segmentation. Fine-tuning segmentation models usually require a heavier adjustment of parameters to align the proper projection directions in the parameter space for new scenarios. This raises a challenge to existing PEFT algorithms as they often inject a limited number of individual parameters into each block which prevents substantial adjustment of the projection direction of the parameter space due to the limitation of Hidden Markov Chain along blocks. In this paper we equip PEFT with a cross-block orchestration mechanism to enable the adaptation of the Segment Anything Model (SAM) to various downstream scenarios. We introduce a novel inter-block communication module which integrates a learnable relation matrix to facilitate communication among different coefficient sets of each PEFT block's parameter space.

Such pre-training techniques have also been explored recently in the remote sensing domain due to the availability of large amount of unlabelled data. Different from standard natural image datasets remote sensing data is acquired from various sensor technologies and exhibit diverse range of scale variations as well as modalities. Existing satellite image pre-training methods either ignore the scale information present in the remote sensing imagery or restrict themselves to use only a single type of data modality. In this paper we re-visit transformers pre-training and leverage multi-scale information that is effectively utilized with multiple modalities. Our proposed approach named SatMAE++ performs multi-scale pre-training and utilizes convolution based upsampling blocks to reconstruct the image at higher scales making it extensible to include more scales. Compared to existing works the proposed SatMAE++ with multi-scale pre-training is equally effective for both optical as well as multi-spectral imagery. Extensive experiments on six datasets reveal the merits of proposed contributions leading to state-of-the-art performance on all datasets. SatMAE++ achieves mean average precision (mAP) gain of 2.5% for multi-label classification task on BigEarthNet dataset."},

In this regard studies on WSSGG have utilized image captions to obtain unlocalized triplets while primarily focusing on grounding the unlocalized triplets over image regions. However they have overlooked the two issues involved in the triplet formation process from the captions: 1) Semantic over-simplification issue arises when extracting triplets from captions where fine-grained predicates in captions are undesirably converted into coarse-grained predicates resulting in a long-tailed predicate distribution and 2) Low-density scene graph issue arises when aligning the triplets in the caption with entity/predicate classes of interest where many triplets are discarded and not used in training leading to insufficient supervision. To tackle the two issues we propose a new approach i.e. Large Language Model for weakly-supervised SGG (LLM4SGG) where we mitigate the two issues by leveraging the LLM's in-depth understanding of language and reasoning ability during the extraction of triplets from captions and alignment of entity/predicate classes with target data. To further engage the LLM in these processes we adopt the idea of Chain-of-Thought and the in-context few-shot learning strategy. To validate the effectiveness of LLM4SGG we conduct extensive experiments on Visual Genome and GQA datasets showing significant improvements in both Recall@K and mean Recall@K compared to the state-of-the-art WSSGG methods. A further appeal is that LLM4SGG is data-efficient enabling effective model training with a small amount of training images."},

In lieu of time-consuming optimization and fine-tuning our zero-shot method generalizes well to arbitrary face portraits with unposed camera views extreme facial expressions and diverse artistic depictions. At its core we leverage the generative prior of 2D diffusion models pre-trained on large-scale image datasets as our rendering backbone while the denoising is guided with disentangled attentive control of appearance and camera pose. To achieve this we first inject the appearance context from the reference image into the self-attention layers of the frozen UNets. The rendering view is then manipulated with a novel conditional control module that interprets the camera pose by watching a condition image of a crossed subject from the same view. Furthermore we insert a trainable cross-view attention module to enhance view consistency which is further strengthened with a novel 3D-aware noise generation process during inference.

The role of alignment is well-studied for low-level enhancement in video but existing works overlook a critical step -- resampling. We show through extensive experiments that for alignment to be effective the resampling should preserve the reference frequency spectrum while minimizing spatial distortions. However most existing works simply use a default choice of bilinear interpolation for resampling even though bilinear interpolation has a smoothing effect and hinders super-resolution. From these observations we propose an implicit resampling-based alignment. The sampling positions are encoded by a sinusoidal positional encoding while the value is estimated with a coordinate network and a window-based cross-attention. We show that bilinear interpolation inherently attenuates high-frequency information while an MLP-based coordinate network can approximate more frequencies. Experiments on synthetic and real-world datasets show that alignment with our proposed implicit resampling enhances the performance of state-of-the-art frameworks with minimal impact on both compute and parameters."},

Jointly estimating the 3D poses of a hand and the object it manipulates from a monocular camera is challenging due to frequent occlusions. Thus existing methods often rely on intermediate 3D shape representations to increase performance. These representations are typically explicit such as 3D point clouds or meshes and thus provide information in the direct surroundings of the intermediate hand pose estimate. To address this we introduce HOISDF a Signed Distance Field (SDF) guided hand-object pose estimation network which jointly exploits hand and object SDFs to provide a global implicit representation over the complete reconstruction volume. Specifically the role of the SDFs is threefold: equip the visual encoder with implicit shape information help to encode hand-object interactions and guide the hand and object pose regression via SDF-based sampling and by augmenting the feature representations. We show that HOISDF achieves state-of-the-art results on hand-object pose estimation benchmarks (DexYCB and HO3Dv2). Code is available https://github.com/amathislab/HOISDF."},
{"title": "Posterior Distillation Sampling", "authors": "Juil Koo, Chanho Park, Minhyuk Sung", "abstract": "We introduce Posterior Distillation Sampling (PDS) a novel optimization method for parametric image editing based on diffusion models. Existing optimization-based methods which leverage the powerful 2D prior of diffusion models to handle various parametric images have mainly focused on generation. Unlike generation editing requires a balance between conforming to the target attribute and preserving the identity of the source content. Recent 2D image editing methods have achieved this balance by leveraging the stochastic latent encoded in the generative process of diffusion models. To extend the editing capabilities of diffusion models shown in pixel space to parameter space we reformulate the 2D image editing method into an optimization form named PDS. PDS matches the stochastic latents of the source and the target enabling the sampling of targets in diverse parameter spaces that align with a desired attribute while maintaining the source's identity. We demonstrate that this optimization resembles running a generative process with the target attribute but aligning this process with the trajectory of the source's generative process. Extensive editing results in Neural Radiance Fields and Scalable Vector Graphics representations demonstrate that PDS is capable of sampling targets to fulfill the aforementioned balance across various parameter spaces."},

However previous distillation methods heavily rely on the sample-wise iterative optimization scheme. As the images-per-class (IPC) setting or image resolution grows larger the necessary computation will demand overwhelming time and resources. In this work we intend to incorporate generative diffusion techniques for computing the surrogate dataset. Observing that key factors for constructing an effective surrogate dataset are representativeness and diversity we design additional minimax criteria in the generative training to enhance these facets for the generated images of diffusion models. We present a theoretical model of the process as hierarchical diffusion control demonstrating the flexibility of the diffusion process to target these criteria without jeopardizing the faithfulness of the sample to the desired distribution. The proposed method achieves state-of-the-art validation performance while demanding much less computational resources.

Instead we learn a lin-ear transform in description space that encodes rotations of the input image. We call this linear transform a steerer since it allows us to transform the descriptions as if the im-age was rotated. From representation theory we know all possible steerers for the rotation group. Steerers can be optimized (A) given a fixed descriptor (B) jointly with a de-scriptor or (C) we can optimize a descriptor given a fixed steerer.

As a kind of visual media for 3D scene representation compression with high rate-distortion performance is an eternal target. Motivated by advances in neural compression and neural field representation we propose NeRFCodec an end-to-end NeRF compression framework that integrates non-linear transform quantization and entropy coding for memory-efficient scene representation. Since training a non-linear transform directly on a large scale of NeRF feature planes is impractical we discover that pre-trained neural 2D image codec can be utilized for compressing the features when adding content-specific parameters. Specifically we reuse neural 2D image codec but modify its encoder and decoder heads while keeping the other parts of the pre-trained decoder frozen. This allows us to train the full pipeline via supervision of rendering loss and entropy loss yielding the rate-distortion balance by updating the content-specific parameters. At test time the bitstreams containing latent code feature decoder head and other side information are transmitted for communication. Experimental results demonstrate our method outperforms existing NeRF compression methods enabling high-quality novel view synthesis with a memory budget of 0.5 MB."},

For this purpose we propose an end-to-end framework solving camera and subject registration together by taking advantage of their mutual dependence whose main idea is as below: i) creating a subject view-transform module (VTM) to project each pedestrian from FPV to a virtual BEV ii) deriving a multi-view geometry-based spatial alignment module (SAM) to estimate the relative camera pose in a unified BEV iii) selecting and refining the subject and camera registration results within the unified BEV.

Specifically the LLaMA-Excitor does not directly change the intermediate hidden state during the self-attention calculation of the transformer structure. We designed the Excitor block as a bypass module for the similarity score computation in LLMs' self-attention to reconstruct keys and change the importance of values by learnable prompts. LLaMA-Excitor ensures a self-adaptive allocation of additional attention to input instructions thus effectively preserving LLMs' pre-trained knowledge when fine-tuning LLMs on low-quality instruction-following datasets. Furthermore we unify the modeling of multi-modal tuning and language-only tuning extending LLaMA-Excitor to a powerful visual instruction follower without the need for complex multi-modal alignment. Our proposed approach is evaluated in language-only and multi-modal tuning experimental scenarios. Notably LLaMA-Excitor is the only method that maintains basic capabilities while achieving a significant improvement (+6%) on the MMLU benchmark. In the visual instruction tuning we achieve a new state-of-the-art image captioning performance of 157.5 CIDEr on MSCOCO and a comparable performance (88.39%) on ScienceQA to cutting-edge models with more parameters and extensive vision-language pertaining."},

To this end we propose a real-world (indoor and outdoor) dataset comprising over 30K pairs of images and events under both low and normal illumination conditions. To achieve this we utilize a robotic arm that traces a consistent non-linear trajectory to curate the dataset with spatial alignment precision under 0.03mm. We then introduce a matching alignment strategy rendering 90% of our dataset with errors less than 0.01s. Based on the dataset we propose a novel event-guided LIE approach called EvLight towards robust performance in real-world low-light scenes.

It aims to synthesize images of a specific person wearing a specified garment. Diffusion model-based approaches have recently become popular as they are excellent at image synthesis tasks. However these approaches usually employ additional image encoders and rely on the cross-attention mechanism for texture transfer from the garment to the person image which affects the try-on's efficiency and fidelity. To address these issues we propose an Texture-Preserving Diffusion (TPD) model for virtual try-on which enhances the fidelity of the results and introduces no additional image encoders. Accordingly we make contributions from two aspects. First we propose to concatenate the masked person and reference garment images along the spatial dimension and utilize the resulting image as the input for the diffusion model's denoising UNet. This enables the original self-attention layers contained in the diffusion model to achieve efficient and accurate texture transfer. Second we propose a novel diffusion-based method that predicts a precise inpainting mask based on the person and reference garment images further enhancing the reliability of the try-on results. In addition we integrate mask prediction and image synthesis into a single compact model.

We study a visual common sense task that requires understanding 'what is not visible'. Specifically given an image (e.g. of a living room) and a name of an object (\"cushion\") a vision system is asked to predict semantically-meaningful regions (masks or bounding boxes) in the image where that object could be placed or is likely be placed by humans (e.g. on the sofa). We call this task: Semantic Placement (SP) and believe that such common-sense visual understanding is critical for assitive robots (tidying a house) AR devices (automatically rendering an object in the user's space) and visually-grounded chatbots with common sense. Studying the invisible is hard. Datasets for image description are typically constructed by curating relevant images (e.g. via image search with object names) and asking humans to annotate the contents of the image; neither of those two steps are straightforward for objects not present in the image. We overcome this challenge by operating in the opposite direction: we start with an image of an object in context (which is easy to find online) and remove that object from the image via inpainting. This automated pipeline converts unstructured web data into a paired with/without object dataset. With this proposed data generation pipeline we collect a novel dataset containing  1.3M images across 9 object categories. We then train a SP prediction model called CLIP-UNet on our dataset.

Unlike previous methods this work casts the neural decoding into optimal transport (OT) and representation decoupling problems. Specifically under discrete OT theory we design a graph matching-guided neural representation learning framework to seek the underlying correspondences between conceptual semantics and neural signals which yields a natural and meaningful self-supervisory task. Moreover the proposed MindArt structured with multiple stand-alone modal branches enables the seamless incorporation of semantic representation into any visual style information thus leaving it to have multi-modal reconstruction and training-free semantic editing capabilities. By doing so the reconstructed images of MindArt have phenomenal realism both in terms of semantics and appearance.

Some recent efforts have sought to transpose Euclidean multimodal learning techniques to hyperbolic spaces by adopting geodesic distance based contrastive losses. However we show both theoretically and empirically that such spatial proximity based contrastive loss significantly disrupts hierarchies in the latent space. To remedy this we advocate that the cross-modal representations should accept the inherent modality gap between text and images and introduce a novel approach to measure cross-modal similarity that does not enforce spatial proximity. Our approach show remarkable capabilities in preserving unimodal hierarchies while aligning the two modalities.

Existing benchmarks for visual grounding primarily operate within small-scale scenes with a few objects. Nevertheless recent advances in imaging technology have enabled the acquisition of gigapixel-level images providing high-resolution details in large-scale scenes containing numerous objects. To bridge this gap between imaging and computer vision benchmarks and make grounding more practically valuable we introduce a novel dataset named GigaGrounding designed to challenge visual grounding models in gigapixel-level large-scale scenes. We extensively analyze and compare the dataset with existing benchmarks demonstrating that GigaGrounding presents unique challenges such as large-scale scene understanding gigapixel-level resolution significant variations in object scales and the \"multi-hop expressions\". Furthermore we introduced a simple yet effective grounding approach which employs a \"glance-to-zoom-in\" paradigm and exhibits enhanced capabilities for addressing the GigaGrounding task.

We posit that 3D awareness implies that representations (1) encode the 3D structure of the scene and (2) consistently represent the surface across views.

Nevertheless the expensive cost of annotation on local clients remains an obstacle to effectively utilizing local data. To mitigate this issue federated active learning methods suggest leveraging local and global model predictions to select a relatively small amount of informative local data for annotation. However existing methods mainly focus on all local data sampled from the same domain making them unreliable in realistic medical scenarios with domain shifts among different clients. In this paper we make the first attempt to assess the informativeness of local data derived from diverse domains and propose a novel methodology termed Federated Evidential Active Learning (FEAL) to calibrate the data evaluation under domain shift. Specifically we introduce a Dirichlet prior distribution in both local and global models to treat the prediction as a distribution over the probability simplex and capture both aleatoric and epistemic uncertainties by using the Dirichlet-based evidential model. Then we employ the epistemic uncertainty to calibrate the aleatoric uncertainty. Afterward we design a diversity relaxation strategy to reduce data redundancy and maintain data diversity. Extensive experiments and analysis on five real multi-center medical image datasets demonstrate the superiority of FEAL over the state-of-the-art active learning methods in federated scenarios with domain shifts.

However current methods still face challenges when used in industrial applications due to unstable results low-quality meshes and a lack of UV unwrapping and skinning weights. In this paper we present SHERT a novel pipeline that can reconstruct semantic human meshes with textures and high-precision details. SHERT applies semantic- and normal-based sampling between the detailed surface (e.g. mesh and SDF) and the corresponding SMPL-X model to obtain a partially sampled semantic mesh and then generates the complete semantic mesh by our specifically designed self-supervised completion and refinement networks. Using the complete semantic mesh as a basis we employ a texture diffusion model to create human textures that are driven by both images and texts. Our reconstructed meshes have stable UV unwrapping high-quality triangle meshes and consistent semantic information. The given SMPL-X model provides semantic information and shape priors allowing SHERT to perform well even with incorrect and incomplete inputs. The semantic information also makes it easy to substitute and animate different body parts such as the face body and hands. Quantitative and qualitative experiments demonstrate that SHERT is capable of producing high-fidelity and robust semantic meshes that outperform state-of-the-art methods."},

However they face a challenge in synthesizing novel views due to the inevitable presence of dynamic objects including the photographer in their wide field of view. In this paper we introduce a new approach called Omnidirectional Local Radiance Fields (OmniLocalRF) that can render static-only scene views removing and inpainting dynamic objects simultaneously. Our approach combines the principles of local radiance fields with the bidirectional optimization of omnidirectional rays. Our input is an omnidirectional video and we evaluate the mutual observations of the entire angle between the previous and current frames. To reduce ghosting artifacts of dynamic objects and inpaint occlusions we devise a multi-resolution motion mask prediction module. Unlike existing methods that primarily separate dynamic components through the temporal domain our method uses multi-resolution neural feature planes for precise segmentation which is more suitable for long 360-degree videos. Our experiments validate that OmniLocalRF outperforms existing methods in both qualitative and quantitative metrics especially in scenarios with complex real-world scenes. In particular our approach eliminates the need for manual interaction such as drawing motion masks by hand and additional pose estimation making it a highly effective and efficient solution."},

However many relationships such as containment and transferability are naturally asymmetric and current approaches for representation and visualization (e.g. t-SNE) do not readily support this. We propose Task2Box an approach to represent tasks using box embeddings---axis-aligned hyperrectangles in low dimensional spaces---that can capture asymmetric relationships between them through volumetric overlaps. We show that Task2Box accurately predicts unseen hierarchical relationships between nodes in ImageNet and iNaturalist datasets as well as transferability between tasks in the Taskonomy benchmark. We also show that box embeddings estimated from task representations (e.g. CLIP Task2Vec or attribute based) can be used to predict relationships between unseen tasks more accurately than classifiers trained on the same representations as well as handcrafted asymmetric distances (e.g. KL divergence). This suggests that low-dimensional box embeddings can effectively capture these task relationships and have the added advantage of being interpretable. We use the approach to visualize relationships among publicly available image classification datasets on popular dataset hosting platform called Hugging Face."},

Prior state-of-the-art (SOTA) methods only focus on the reconstruction of the visible areas in a scene neglecting the invisible areas due to the occlusions e.g. the contact surface between furniture occluded wall and floor. Our method tackles the task of completing the occluded scene surfaces resulting in a complete 3D scene mesh. The core idea of our method is learning 3D geometry prior from various complete scenes to infer the occluded geometry of an unseen scene from solely depth measurements. We design a coarse-fine hierarchical octree representation coupled with a dual-decoder architecture i.e. Geo-decoder and 3D Inpainter which jointly reconstructs the complete 3D scene geometry. The Geo-decoder with detailed representation at fine levels is optimized online for each scene to reconstruct visible surfaces. The 3D Inpainter with abstract representation at coarse levels is trained offline using various scenes to complete occluded surfaces. As a result while the Geo-decoder is specialized for an individual scene the 3D Inpainter can be generally applied across different scenes. We evaluate the proposed method on the 3D Completed Room Scene (3D-CRS) and iTHOR datasets significantly outperforming the SOTA methods by a gain of 16.8% and 24.2% in terms of the completeness of 3D reconstruction. 3D-CRS dataset including a complete 3D mesh of each scene is provided at project webpage."},

Such a stringent constraint always leads to catastrophic forgetting of the learned knowledge. Currently existing methods either employ knowledge distillation techniques or preserved class prototypes to sustain prior knowledge. However two critical issues still persist. On the one hand as the model is continually updated the preserved prototypes of old classes will inevitably derive from the suitable location in the feature space of the new model. On the other hand due to the lack of exemplars the features of new classes will take the place of similar old classes which breaks the classification boundary. To address these challenges we propose a Feature Calibration and Separation (FCS) method for NECIL. Our approach comprises a Feature Calibration Network (FCN) that adapts prototypes of old classes to the new model via optimal transport learning approximating the drift of prototypes caused by model evolution. Additionally we also propose a Prototype-Involved Contrastive Loss (PIC) that enhances feature separation among different classes. Specifically to mitigate the boundary distortion arising from the interplay of classes from different learning stages prototypes are involved in pushing the feature of new classes away from the old classes. Extensive experiments on three datasets with different settings have demonstrated the superiority of our FCS method against the state-of-the-art class incremental learning approaches.

Venkatesh Babu", "abstract": "Vision Transformer (ViT) has emerged as a prominent architecture for various computer vision tasks. In ViT we divide the input image into patch tokens and process them through a stack of self-attention blocks. However unlike Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) ViT's simple architecture has no informative inductive bias (e.g. locality etc.). Due to this ViT requires a large amount of data for pre-training. Various data-efficient approaches (DeiT) have been proposed to train ViT on balanced datasets effectively. However limited literature discusses the use of ViT for datasets with long-tailed imbalances. In this work we introduce DeiT-LT to tackle the problem of training ViTs from scratch on long-tailed datasets. In DeiT-LT we introduce an efficient and effective way of distillation from CNN via distillation \\texttt DIST  token by using out-of-distribution images and re-weighting the distillation loss to enhance focus on tail classes. This leads to the learning of local CNN-like features in early ViT blocks improving generalization for tail classes. Further to mitigate overfitting we propose distilling from a flat CNN teacher which leads to learning low-rank generalizable features for DIST tokens across all ViT blocks. With the proposed DeiT-LT scheme the distillation DIST token becomes an expert on the tail classes and the classifier CLS token becomes an expert on the head classes. The experts help to effectively learn features corresponding to both the majority and minority classes using a distinct set of tokens within the same ViT architecture. We show the effectiveness of DeiT-LT for training ViT from scratch on datasets ranging from small-scale CIFAR-10 LT to large-scale iNaturalist-2018.

Existing methods mainly offer two approaches: (i) interpreting textual instructions with constrained controllability or (ii) reconstructing 3D objects from 2D images. Both of them limit customization to the confines of the 2D reference and potentially introduce undesirable artifacts during the 3D lifting process restricting the scope for direct and versatile 3D modifications.

This flexibility however makes the strict enforcement of constraints on DNNs a difficult problem. In contexts where it is critical to limit the function space to which certain network components belong such as wavelets employed in Multi-Resolution Analysis (MRA) naive constraints via additional terms in the loss function are inadequate. To address this we introduce a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) wherein the convolutional filters are strictly constrained to be wavelets. This allows the filters to update to task-optimized wavelets during the training procedure. Our primary contribution lies in the rigorous formulation of these filters via a constrained empirical risk minimization framework thereby providing an exact mechanism to enforce these structural constraints. While our work is grounded in theory we investigate our approach empirically through applications in medical imaging particularly in the task of contour prediction around various organs achieving superior performance compared to baseline methods."},

Initially CORES delves into the extremities of convolutional responses by considering both their magnitude and the frequency of significant values. Moreover through backtracking from the most prominent predictions CORES effectively pinpoints sample-relevant kernels across different layers.

A widely adopted method within OCL is slot attention which utilizes attention mechanisms to iteratively refine slot representations. However a major drawback of most object-centric models including slot attention is their reliance on predefining the number of slots. This not only necessitates prior knowledge of the dataset but also overlooks the inherent variability in the number of objects present in each instance. To overcome this fundamental limitation we present a novel complexity-aware object auto-encoder framework. Within this framework we introduce an adaptive slot attention (AdaSlot) mechanism that dynamically determines the optimal number of slots based on the content of the data. This is achieved by proposing a discrete slot sampling module that is responsible for selecting an appropriate number of slots from a candidate list. Furthermore we introduce a masked slot decoder that suppresses unselected slots during the decoding process. Our framework tested extensively on object discovery tasks with various datasets shows performance matching or exceeding top fixed-slot models. Moreover our analysis substantiates that our method exhibits the capability to dynamically adapt the slot number according to each instance's complexity offering the potential for further exploration in slot attention research.

Thus using bounding boxes (bboxes) as annotations has shown great potential. The current mainstream approach is a two-step process involving the generation of pseudo-labels from box annotations and the training of a 3DIS network with the pseudo-labels. However due to the presence of intersections among bboxes not every point has a determined instance label especially in overlapping areas. To generate higher quality pseudo-labels and achieve more precise weakly supervised 3DIS results we propose the Box-Supervised Simulation-assisted Mean Teacher for 3D Instance Segmentation (BSNet) which devises a novel pseudo-labeler called Simulation-assisted Transformer. The labeler consists of two main components. The first is Simulation-assisted Mean Teacher which introduces Mean Teacher for the first time in this task and constructs simulated samples to assist the labeler in acquiring prior knowledge about overlapping areas.

Once an L-ReID model is updated using new data all historical images in the gallery are required to be re-calculated to obtain new features for testing known as \"re-indexing\". However it is infeasible when raw images in the gallery are unavailable due to data privacy concerns resulting in incompatible retrieval between the query and the gallery features calculated by different models which causes significant performance degradation. In this paper we focus on a new task called Re-indexing Free Lifelong Person Re-identification (RFL-ReID) which requires achieving effective L-ReID without re-indexing raw images in the gallery. To this end we propose a Continual Compatible Representation (C2R) method which facilitates the query feature calculated by the continuously updated model to effectively retrieve the gallery feature calculated by the old model in a compatible manner.

This setting neglects the more practical scenario where training data are collected from multiple sources. This motivates us to extend ADA from a single source domain to multiple source domains termed Multi-source Active Domain Adaptation (MADA). Not surprisingly we find that most traditional ADA methods cannot work directly in such a setting mainly due to the excessive domain gap introduced by all the source domains. Considering this we propose a Detective framework that comprehensively considers the domain shift between multi-source domains and target domains to detect the informative target samples. Specifically the Detective leverages a dynamic Domain Adaptation (DA) model that learns how to adapt the model's parameters to fit the union of multi-source domains. This enables an approximate single-source domain modeling by the dynamic model. We then comprehensively measure both domain uncertainty and predictive uncertainty in the target domain to detect informative target samples using evidential deep learning thereby mitigating uncertainty miscalibration. Experiments demonstrate that our solution outperforms existing methods by a considerable margin on three domain adaptation benchmarks."},

We then integrate these sub-elements by matching each subquestion with its relevant sub-images while also retaining the original image to construct a comprehensive answer to the original question without losing sight of the overall context. This strategy mirrors the human cognitive process of simplifying complex problems into smaller components for individual analysis followed by an integration of these insights. We implement DIEM on the LLaVA-v1.5 model and evaluate its performance on ScienceQA and MM-Vet. Experimental results indicate that our method boosts accuracy in most question classes of the ScienceQA (+2.03% in average) especially in the image modality (+3.40%). On MM-Vet our method achieves an improvement in MM-Vet scores increasing from 31.1 to 32.4. These findings highlight DIEM's effectiveness in harmonizing the complexities of multimodal data demonstrating its ability to enhance accuracy and depth in image question answering through its decomposition-integration process."},

Existing methods optimize 3D representations like mesh or neural fields via score distillation sampling (SDS) which suffers from inadequate fine details or excessive training time. In this paper we propose an efficient yet effective framework HumanGaussian that generates high-quality 3D humans with fine-grained geometry and realistic appearance. Our key insight is that 3D Gaussian Splatting is an efficient renderer with periodic Gaussian shrinkage or growing where such adaptive density control can be naturally guided by intrinsic human structures. Specifically 1) we first propose a Structure-Aware SDS that simultaneously optimizes human appearance and geometry. The multi-modal score function from both RGB and depth space is leveraged to distill the Gaussian densification and pruning process. 2) Moreover we devise an Annealed Negative Prompt Guidance by decomposing SDS into a noisier generative score and a cleaner classifier score which well addresses the over-saturation issue. The floating artifacts are further eliminated based on Gaussian size in a prune-only phase to enhance generation smoothness. Extensive experiments demonstrate the superior efficiency and competitive quality of our framework rendering vivid 3D humans under diverse scenarios."},

To understand the inductive biases provided by architectures independently from GD we examine untrained randomweight networks Even simple MLPs show strong inductive biases uniform sampling in weight space yields a very biased distribution of functions in terms of complexity But unlike common wisdom NNs do not have an inherent simplicity bias This property depends on components such as ReLUs residual connections and layer normalizations Alternative architectures can be built with a bias for any level of complexity.

This has prompted increased interest to explore the object discovery task as an unsupervised alternative. In particular promising results were achieved in localizing instances using motion supervision only. However the motion signal introduces complexities due to its inherent noise and sparsity which constrains the effectiveness of current methodologies. In the present paper we propose DIOD (self DIstillation meets Object Discovery) the first method that places the motion-guided object discovery within a framework of continuous improvement through knowledge distillation providing solutions to existing limitations (i) DIOD robustly eliminates the noise present in the exploited motion maps providing accurate motion-supervision (ii) DIOD leverages the discovered objects within an iterative pseudo-labeling framework enriching the initial motion-supervision with static objects which results in a cost-efficient increase in performance. Through experiments on synthetic and real-world datasets we demonstrate the benefits of bridging the gap between object discovery and distillation by significantly improving the state-of-the-art. This enhancement is also sustained across other demanding metrics so far reserved for supervised tasks."},

Recovering 3D depth from a single image is geometrically ill-posed and requires scene understanding so it is not surprising that the rise of deep learning has led to a breakthrough. The impressive progress of monocular depth estimators has mirrored the growth in model capacity from relatively modest CNNs to large Transformer architectures. Still monocular depth estimators tend to struggle when presented with images with unfamiliar content and layout since their knowledge of the visual world is restricted by the data seen during training and challenged by zero-shot generalization to new domains. This motivates us to explore whether the extensive priors captured in recent generative diffusion models can enable better more generalizable depth estimation. We introduce Marigold a method for affine-invariant monocular depth estimation that is derived from Stable Diffusion and retains its rich prior knowledge. The estimator can be fine-tuned in a couple of days on a single GPU using only synthetic training data.

However the lack of abundant real 3D anomaly data limits the scalability of current models. To enable scalable anomaly data collection we propose a 3D anomaly synthesis pipeline to adapt existing large-scale 3D models for 3D anomaly detection. Specifically we construct a synthetic dataset i.e. Anomaly-ShapeNet based on ShapeNet. Anomaly-ShapeNet consists of 1600 point cloud samples under 40 categories which provides a rich and varied collection of data enabling efficient training and enhancing adaptability to industrial scenarios. Meanwhile to enable scalable representation learning for 3D anomaly localization we propose a self-supervised method i.e. Iterative Mask Reconstruction Network (IMRNet). During training we propose a geometry-aware sample module to preserve potentially anomalous local regions during point cloud down-sampling. Then we randomly mask out point patches and sent the visible patches to a transformer for reconstruction-based self-supervision. During testing the point cloud repeatedly goes through the Mask Reconstruction Network with each iteration's output becoming the next input. By merging and contrasting the final reconstructed point cloud with the initial input our method successfully locates anomalies. Experiments show that IMRNet outperforms previous state-of-the-art methods achieving 66.1% in I-AUC on our Anomaly-ShapeNet dataset and 72.5% in I-AUC on Real3D-AD dataset.

We leverage dynamic convolutions to incorporate additional parameters into the networks with only a marginal rise in FLOPs. The ParameterNet approach allows low-FLOPs networks to take advantage of large-scale visual pretraining. Furthermore we extend the ParameterNet concept to the language domain to enhance inference results while preserving inference speed. Experiments on the large-scale ImageNet-22K have shown the superiority of our ParameterNet scheme. For example ParameterNet-600M can achieve higher accuracy than the widely-used Swin Transformer (81.6% vs. 80.9%) and has much lower FLOPs (0.6G vs. 4.5G).

Hi-Mapper investigates the hierarchical organization of the visual scene by 1) pre-defining a hierarchy tree through the encapsulation of probability densities; and 2) learning the hierarchical relations in hyperbolic space with a novel hierarchical contrastive loss. The pre-defined hierarchy tree recursively interacts with the visual features of the pre-trained DNNs through hierarchy decomposition and encoding procedures thereby effectively identifying the visual hierarchy and enhancing the recognition of an entire scene.

We observe that over- and over-exposed regions display opposite color tone distribution shifts which may not be easily normalized in joint modeling as they usually do not have \"normal-exposed\" regions/pixels as reference. In this paper we propose a novel method to enhance images with both over- and under-exposures by learning to estimate and correct such color shifts. Specifically we first derive the color feature maps of the brightened and darkened versions of the input image via a UNet-based network followed by a pseudo-normal feature generator to produce pseudo-normal color feature maps. We then propose a novel COlor Shift Estimation (COSE) module to estimate the color shifts between the derived brightened (or darkened) color feature maps and the pseudo-normal color feature maps. The COSE module corrects the estimated color shifts of the over- and under-exposed regions separately. We further propose a novel COlor MOdulation (COMO) module to modulate the separately corrected colors in the over- and under-exposed regions to produce the enhanced image. Comprehensive experiments show that our method outperforms existing approaches."},

However current research is hindered by 1) the difficulty in processing events because of their prolonged duration and dynamic actions with complex and ambiguous semantics and 2) the redundant action depiction of the event frame representation with fixed stacks. We find language naturally conveys abundant semantic information rendering it stunningly superior in reducing semantic uncertainty. In light of this we propose ExACT a novel approach that for the first time tackles event-based action recognition from a cross-modal conceptualizing perspective. Our ExACT brings two technical contributions. Firstly we propose an adaptive fine-grained event (AFE) representation to adaptively filter out the repeated events for the stationary objects while preserving dynamic ones. This subtly enhances the performance of ExACT without extra computational cost. Then we propose a conceptual reasoning-based uncertainty estimation module which simulates the recognition process to enrich the semantic representation. In particular conceptual reasoning builds the temporal relation based on the action semantics and uncertainty estimation tackles the semantic uncertainty of actions based on the distributional representation. Experiments show that our ExACT achieves superior recognition accuracy of 94.83%(+2.23%) 90.10%(+37.47%) and 67.24% on PAF HARDVS and our SeAct datasets respectively."},

This paper introduces MPerceiver: a novel multimodal prompt learning approach that harnesses Stable Diffusion (SD) priors to enhance adaptiveness generalizability and fidelity for all-in-one image restoration. Specifically we develop a dual-branch module to master two types of SD prompts: textual for holistic representation and visual for multiscale detail representation. Both prompts are dynamically adjusted by degradation predictions from the CLIP image encoder enabling adaptive responses to diverse unknown degradations. Moreover a plug-in detail refinement module improves restoration fidelity via direct encoder-to-decoder information transformation. To assess our method MPerceiver is trained on 9 tasks for all-in-one IR and outperforms state-of-the-art task-specific methods across many tasks.

However owing to the ill-posed nature of this problem there has been no solution that can provide consistent high-quality novel views from camera positions that are significantly different from the training views. In this work we introduce Neural Parametric Gaussians (NPGs) to take on this challenge by imposing a two-stage approach: first we fit a low-rank neural deformation model which then is used as regularization for non-rigid reconstruction in the second stage. The first stage learns the object's deformations such that it preserves consistency in novel views. The second stage obtains high reconstruction quality by optimizing 3D Gaussians that are driven by the coarse model. To this end we introduce a local 3D Gaussian representation where temporally shared Gaussians are anchored in and deformed by local oriented volumes. The resulting combined model can be rendered as radiance fields resulting in high-quality photo-realistic reconstructions of the non-rigidly deforming objects. We demonstrate that NPGs achieve superior results compared to previous works especially in challenging scenarios with few multi-view cues."},

Our framework aims to break through this bottleneck which includes two innovative components: an adaptive patch augmentation scheme and a hard-patch contrastive learning module. We first identify hard patches by computing the average entropy of each patch and then shield hard patches to prevent them from being cropped out while performing random patch cutmix. Such a scheme is able to prevent hard regions from being inadequately trained under strong augmentation. We further develop a new hard-patch contrastive learning algorithm to direct model attention to hard regions by applying extra contrast to pixels in hard patches further improving segmentation performance on hard cases.

Previous methods improve fine-tuning performance by maintaining knowledge of the source datasets or introducing regularization terms such as contrastive loss. However these methods require auxiliary source information (e.g. source labels or datasets) or heavy additional computations. In this paper we propose a simple method called adaptive random feature regularization (AdaRand). AdaRand helps the feature extractors of training models to adaptively change the distribution of feature vectors for downstream classification tasks without auxiliary source information and with reasonable computation costs. To this end AdaRand minimizes the gap between feature vectors and random reference vectors that are sampled from class conditional Gaussian distributions. Furthermore AdaRand dynamically updates the conditional distribution to follow the currently updated feature extractors and balance the distance between classes in feature spaces. Our experiments show that AdaRand outperforms the other fine-tuning regularization requiring auxiliary source information and heavy computation costs."},

However one of the major drawbacks of diffusion models is that the image generation process is costly. A large image-to-image network has to be applied many times to iteratively refine an image from random noise. While many recent works propose techniques to reduce the number of required steps they generally treat the underlying denoising network as a black box. In this work we investigate the behavior of the layers within the network and find that 1) the layers' output changes smoothly over time 2) the layers show distinct patterns of change and 3) the change from step to step is often very small. We hypothesize that many layer computations in the denoising network are redundant. Leveraging this we introduce Block Caching in which we reuse outputs from layer blocks of previous steps to speed up inference. Furthermore we propose a technique to automatically determine caching schedules based on each block's changes over timesteps. In our experiments we show through FID human evaluation and qualitative analysis that Block Caching allows to generate images with higher visual quality at the same computational cost. We demonstrate this for different state-of-the-art models (LDM and EMU) and solvers (DDIM and DPM)."},

Especially many studies have shown that sparse attacks pose a significant threat to DNNs on account of their exceptional imperceptibility. Current sparse attack methods mostly limit only the magnitude and number of perturbations while generally overlooking the location of the perturbations resulting in decreased performances on attack transferability. A subset of studies indicates that perturbations existing in the significant regions with rich classification-relevant features are more effective. Leveraging this insight we introduce the structural sparsity constraint in the framework of generative models to limit the perturbation positions. To ensure that the perturbations are generated towards classification-relevant regions we propose an exact group sparsity training method to learn pixel-level and group-level sparsity. For purpose of improving the effectiveness of sparse training we further put forward masked quantization network and multi-stage optimization algorithm in the training process. Utilizing CNNs as surrogate models extensive experiments demonstrate that our method has higher transferability in image classification attack compared to state-of-the-art methods at approximately same sparsity levels.

Most existing methods however generate images only at fixed-scale magnification and suffer from over-smoothing and artifacts. Additionally they do not offer enough diversity of output images nor image consistency at different scales. Most relevant work applied Implicit Neural Representation (INR) to the denoising diffusion model to obtain continuous-resolution yet diverse and high-quality SR results. Since this model operates in the image space the larger the resolution of image is produced the more memory and inference time is required and it also does not maintain scale-specific consistency. We propose a novel pipeline that can super-resolve an input image or generate from a random noise a novel image at arbitrary scales. The method consists of a pretrained auto-encoder a latent diffusion model and an implicit neural decoder and their learning strategies. The proposed method adopts diffusion processes in a latent space thus efficient yet aligned with output image space decoded by MLPs at arbitrary scales. More specifically our arbitrary-scale decoder is designed by the symmetric decoder w/o up-scaling from the pretrained auto-encoder and Local Implicit Image Function (LIIF) in series. The latent diffusion process is learnt by the denoising and the alignment losses jointly. Errors in output images are backpropagated via the fixed decoder improving the quality of output images. In the extensive experiments using multiple public benchmarks on the two tasks i.e. image super-resolution and novel image generation at arbitrary scales the proposed method outperforms relevant methods in metrics of image quality diversity and scale consistency.

Conventional image retouching methods perform less satisfactorily in terms of generalization performance and stability when applied to videos without exploiting the correlation among frames. To address this issue we propose a Video Retouching transformEr to remove facial imperfections in videos which is referred to as VRetouchEr. Specifically we estimate the apparent motion of imperfections between two consecutive frames and the resulting displacement vectors are used to refine the imperfection map which is synthesized from the current frame together with the corresponding encoder features. The flow-based imperfection refinement is critical for precise and stable retouching across frames. To leverage the temporal contextual information we inject the refined imperfection map into each transformer block for multi-frame masked attention computation such that we can capture the interdependence between the current frame and multiple reference frames. As a result the imperfection regions can be replaced with normal skin with high fidelity while at the same time keeping the other regions unchanged. Extensive experiments are performed to verify the superiority of VRetouchEr over state-of-the-art image retouching methods in terms of fidelity and stability."},
{"title": "Boosting Image Restoration via Priors from Pre-trained Models", "authors": "Xiaogang Xu, Shu Kong, Tao Hu, Zhe Liu, Hujun Bao", "abstract": "Pre-trained models with large-scale training data such as CLIP and Stable Diffusion have demonstrated remarkable performance in various high-level computer vision tasks such as image understanding and generation from language descriptions. Yet their potential for low-level tasks such as image restoration remains relatively unexplored. In this paper we explore such models to enhance image restoration. As off-the-shelf features (OSF) from pre-trained models do not directly serve image restoration we propose to learn an additional lightweight module called Pre-Train-Guided Refinement Module (PTG-RM) to refine restoration results of a target restoration network with OSF. PTG-RM consists of two components Pre-Train-Guided Spatial-Varying Enhancement (PTG-SVE) and Pre-Train-Guided Channel-Spatial Attention (PTG-CSA). PTG-SVE enables optimal short- and long-range neural operations while PTG-CSA enhances spatial-channel attention for restoration-related learning. Extensive experiments demonstrate that PTG-RM with its compact size (<1M parameters) effectively enhances restoration performance of various models across different tasks including low-light enhancement deraining deblurring and denoising."},

Mok, Ke Yan, Jiawen Yao, Xin Chen, Zaiyi Liu, Le Lu, Ling Zhang, Minfeng Xu", "abstract": "In the realm of medical 3D data such as CT and MRI images prevalent anisotropic resolution is characterized by high intra-slice but diminished inter-slice resolution. The lowered resolution between adjacent slices poses challenges hindering optimal viewing experiences and impeding the development of robust downstream analysis algorithms. Various volumetric super-resolution algorithms aim to surmount these challenges enhancing inter-slice resolution and overall 3D medical imaging quality. However existing approaches confront inherent challenges: 1) often tailored to specific upsampling factors lacking flexibility for diverse clinical scenarios; 2) newly generated slices frequently suffer from over-smoothing degrading fine details and leading to inter-slice inconsistency. In response this study presents CycleINR a novel enhanced Implicit Neural Representation model for 3D medical data volumetric super-resolution. Leveraging the continuity of the learned implicit function the CycleINR model can achieve results with arbitrary up-sampling rates eliminating the need for separate training. Additionally we enhance the grid sampling in CycleINR with a local attention mechanism and mitigate over-smoothing by integrating cycle-consistent loss. We introduce a new metric Slice-wise Noise Level Inconsistency (SNLI) to quantitatively assess inter-slice noise level inconsistency. The effectiveness of our approach is demonstrated through image quality evaluations on an in-house dataset and a downstream task analysis on the Medical Segmentation Decathlon liver tumor dataset."},
{"title": "EventDance: Unsupervised Source-free Cross-modal Adaptation for Event-based Object Recognition", "authors": "Xu Zheng, Lin Wang", "abstract": "In this paper we make the first attempt at achieving the cross-modal (i.e. image-to-events) adaptation for event-based object recognition without accessing any labeled source image data owning to privacy and commercial issues. Tackling this novel problem is non-trivial due to the novelty of event cameras and the distinct modality gap between images and events. In particular as only the source model is available a hurdle is how to extract the knowledge from the source model by only using the unlabeled target event data while achieving knowledge transfer. To this end we propose a novel framework dubbed EventDance for this unsupervised source-free cross-modal adaptation problem. Importantly inspired by event-to-video reconstruction methods we propose a reconstruction-based modality bridging (RMB) module which reconstructs intensity frames from events in a self-supervised manner. This makes it possible to build up the surrogate images to extract the knowledge (i.e. labels) from the source model. We then propose a multi-representation knowledge adaptation (MKA) module that transfers the knowledge to target models learning events with multiple representation types for fully exploring the spatiotemporal information of events. The two modules connecting the source and target models are mutually updated so as to achieve the best performance. Experiments on three benchmark datasets with two adaption settings show that EventDance is on par with prior methods utilizing the source data."},
{"title": "From Feature to Gaze: A Generalizable Replacement of Linear Layer for Gaze Estimation", "authors": "Yiwei Bao, Feng Lu", "abstract": "Deep-learning-based gaze estimation approaches often suffer from notable performance degradation in unseen target domains. One of the primary reasons is that the Fully Connected layer is highly prone to overfitting when mapping the high-dimensional image feature to 3D gaze. In this paper we propose Analytical Gaze Generalization framework (AGG) to improve the generalization ability of gaze estimation models without touching target domain data. The AGG consists of two modules the Geodesic Projection Module (GPM) and the Sphere-Oriented Training (SOT). GPM is a generalizable replacement of FC layer which projects high-dimensional image features to 3D space analytically to extract the principle components of gaze. Then we propose Sphere-Oriented Training (SOT) to incorporate the GPM into the training process and further improve cross-domain performances. Experimental results demonstrate that the AGG effectively alleviate the overfitting problem and consistently improves the cross-domain gaze estimation accuracy in 12 cross-domain settings without requiring any target domain data. The insight from the Analytical Gaze Generalization framework has the potential to benefit other regression tasks with physical meanings."},
{"title": "Curriculum Point Prompting for Weakly-Supervised Referring Image Segmentation", "authors": "Qiyuan Dai, Sibei Yang", "abstract": "Referring image segmentation (RIS) aims to precisely segment referents in images through corresponding natural language expressions yet relying on cost-intensive mask annotations. Weakly supervised RIS thus learns from image-text pairs to pixel-level semantics which is challenging for segmenting fine-grained masks. A natural approach to enhancing segmentation precision is to empower weakly supervised RIS with the image segmentation foundation model SAM. Nevertheless we observe that simply integrating SAM yields limited benefits and can even lead to performance regression due to the inevitable noise issues and challenges in excessive focus on object parts. In this paper we present an innovative framework Point PrompTing (PPT) incorporated with the proposed multi-source curriculum learning strategy to address these challenges. Specifically the core of PPT is a point generator that not only harnesses CLIP's text-image alignment capability and SAM's powerful mask generation ability but also generates negative point prompts to address the noisy and excessive focus issues inherently and effectively. In addition we introduce a curriculum learning strategy with object-centric images to help PPT gradually learn from simpler yet precise semantic alignment to more complex RIS. Experiments demonstrate that our PPT significantly and consistently outperforms prior weakly supervised techniques on mIoU by 11.34% 14.14% and 6.97% across RefCOCO RefCOCO+ and G-Ref respectively."},
{"title": "Elite360D: Towards Efficient 360 Depth Estimation via Semantic- and Distance-Aware Bi-Projection Fusion", "authors": "Hao Ai, Lin Wang", "abstract": "360 depth estimation has recently received great attention for 3D reconstruction owing to its omnidirectional field of view (FoV). Recent approaches are predominantly focused on cross-projection fusion with geometry-based re-projection: they fuse 360 images with equirectangular projection (ERP) and another projection type e.g. cubemap projection to estimate depth with the ERP format. However these methods suffer from 1) limited local receptive fields making it hardly possible to capture large FoV scenes and 2) prohibitive computational cost caused by the complex cross-projection fusion module design. In this paper we propose Elite360D a novel framework that inputs the ERP image and icosahedron projection (ICOSAP) point set which is undistorted and spatially continuous. Elite360D is superior in its capacity in learning a representation from a local-with-global perspective. With a flexible ERP image encoder it includes an ICOSAP point encoder and a Bi-projection Bi-attention Fusion (B2F) module (totally  1M parameters). Specifically the ERP image encoder can take various perspective image-trained backbones (e.g. ResNet Transformer) to extract local features. The point encoder extracts the global features from the ICOSAP. Then the B2F module captures the semantic- and distance-aware dependencies between each pixel of the ERP feature and the entire ICOSAP feature set. Without specific backbone design and obvious computational cost increase Elite360D outperforms the prior arts on several benchmark datasets."},
{"title": "Artist-Friendly Relightable and Animatable Neural Heads", "authors": "Yingyan Xu, Prashanth Chandran, Sebastian Weiss, Markus Gross, Gaspard Zoss, Derek Bradley", "abstract": "An increasingly common approach for creating photo-realistic digital avatars is through the use of volumetric neural fields. The original neural radiance field (NeRF) allowed for impressive novel view synthesis of static heads when trained on a set of multi-view images and follow up methods showed that these neural representations can be extended to dynamic avatars. Recently new variants also surpassed the usual drawback of baked-in illumination in neural representations showing that static neural avatars can be relit in any environment. In this work we simultaneously tackle both the motion and illumination problem proposing a new method for relightable and animatable neural heads. Our method builds on a proven dynamic avatar approach based on a mixture of volumetric primitives combined with a recently-proposed lightweight hardware setup for relightable neural fields and includes a novel architecture that allows relighting dynamic neural avatars performing unseen expressions in any environment even with nearfield illumination and viewpoints."},
{"title": "Defense without Forgetting: Continual Adversarial Defense with Anisotropic & Isotropic Pseudo Replay", "authors": "Yuhang Zhou, Zhongyun Hua", "abstract": "Deep neural networks have demonstrated susceptibility to adversarial attacks. Adversarial defense techniques often focus on one-shot setting to maintain robustness against attack. However new attacks can emerge in sequences in real-world deployment scenarios. As a result it is crucial for a defense model to constantly adapt to new attacks but the adaptation process can lead to catastrophic forgetting of previously defended against attacks. In this paper we discuss for the first time the concept of continual adversarial defense under a sequence of attacks and propose a lifelong defense baseline called Anisotropic & Isotropic Replay (AIR) which offers three advantages: (1) Isotropic replay ensures model consistency in the neighborhood distribution of new data indirectly aligning the output preference between old and new tasks. (2) Anisotropic replay enables the model to learn a compromise data manifold with fresh mixed semantics for further replay constraints and potential future attacks. (3) A straightforward regularizer mitigates the 'plasticity-stability' trade-off by aligning model output between new and old tasks. Experiment results demonstrate that AIR can approximate or even exceed the empirical performance upper bounds achieved by Joint Training."},

While both types integrate pre-trained vision-language models such as CLIP for image-text similarity evaluation and a pre-trained language model (LM) for caption generation their distinction lies in the utilization of textual corpus for LM training. Despite achieving promising performance on certain metrics existing methods commonly suffer from drawbacks. Training-free methods often generate hallucinations whereas text-only-training methods may lack generalization capability. To address these challenges we propose a novel Memory-Augmented zero-shot image Captioning framework (MeaCap). This framework equipped with a textual memory incorporates a retrieve-then-filter module to extract key concepts highly relevant to the image. By leveraging our proposed memory-augmented visual-related fusion score within a keywords-to-sentence LM MeaCap generates concept-centered captions that exhibit high consistency with the image with reduced hallucinations and enriched world knowledge.

EscherNet learns implicit and generative 3D representations coupled with a specialised camera positional encoding allowing precise and continuous relative control of the camera transformation between an arbitrary number of reference and target views. EscherNet offers exceptional generality flexibility and scalability in view synthesis --- it can generate more than 100 consistent target views simultaneously on a single consumer-grade GPU despite being trained with a fixed number of 3 reference views to 3 target views. As a result EscherNet not only addresses zero-shot novel view synthesis but also naturally unifies single- and multi-image 3D reconstruction combining these diverse tasks into a single cohesive framework.

{"title": "Parameter Efficient Self-Supervised Geospatial Domain Adaptation", "authors": "Linus Scheibenreif, Michael Mommert, Damian Borth", "abstract": "As large-scale foundation models become publicly available for different domains efficiently adapting them to individual downstream applications and additional data modalities has turned into a central challenge. For example foundation models for geospatial and satellite remote sensing applications are commonly trained on large optical RGB or multi-spectral datasets although data from a wide variety of heterogeneous sensors are available in the remote sensing domain. This leads to significant discrepancies between pre-training and downstream target data distributions for many important applications. Fine-tuning large foundation models to bridge that gap incurs high computational cost and can be infeasible when target datasets are small. In this paper we address the question of how large pre-trained foundational transformer models can be efficiently adapted to downstream remote sensing tasks involving different data modalities or limited dataset size. We present a self-supervised adaptation method that boosts downstream linear evaluation accuracy of different foundation models by 4-6% (absolute) across 8 remote sensing datasets while outperforming full fine-tuning when training only 1-2% of the model parameters. Our method significantly improves label efficiency and increases few-shot accuracy by 6-10% on different datasets."},

One prevalent method to address one-shot MIS is joint registration and segmentation (JRS) with a shared encoder which mainly explores the voxel-wise correspondence between the labeled data and unlabeled data for better segmentation. However this method omits underlying connections between task-specific decoders for segmentation and registration leading to unstable training. In this paper we propose a novel Bi-level Learning of Task-Specific Decoders for one-shot MIS employing a pretrained fixed shared encoder that is proved to be more quickly adapted to brand-new datasets than existing JRS without fixed shared encoder paradigm. To be more specific we introduce a bi-level optimization training strategy considering registration as a major objective and segmentation as a learnable constraint by leveraging inter-task coupling dependencies. Furthermore we design an appearance conformity constraint strategy that learns the backward transformations generating the fake labeled data used to perform data augmentation instead of the labeled image to avoid performance degradation caused by inconsistent styles between unlabeled data and labeled data in previous methods. Extensive experiments on the brain MRI task across ABIDE ADNI and PPMI datasets demonstrate that the proposed Bi-JROS outperforms state-of-the-art one-shot MIS methods for both segmentation and registration tasks.

Existing state-of-the-art KD methods for object detection are mostly based on feature imitation. In this paper we present a general and effective prediction mimicking distillation scheme called CrossKD which delivers the intermediate features of the student's detection head to the teacher's detection head. The resulting cross-head predictions are then forced to mimic the teacher's predictions. This manner relieves the student's head from receiving contradictory supervision signals from the annotations and the teacher's predictions greatly improving the student's detection performance. Moreover as mimicking the teacher's predictions is the target of KD CrossKD offers more task-oriented information in contrast with feature imitation. On MS COCO with only prediction mimicking losses applied our CrossKD boosts the average precision of GFL ResNet-50 with 1x training schedule from 40.2 to 43.7 outperforming all existing KD methods. In addition our method also works well when distilling detectors with heterogeneous backbones."},

The task is particularly challenging for those invisible areas due to the inherent occlusions and lighting ambiguity. Existing works ignore the information missing or ambiguous in those shaded and occluded areas resulting in distorted geometric prediction. To address this issue we propose a novel method Bi-SSC bidirectional geometric semantic fusion for camera-based 3D semantic scene completion. The key insight is to use the neighboring structure of objects in the image and the spatial differences from different perspectives to compensate for the lack of information in occluded areas. Specifically we introduce a spatial sensory fusion module with multiple association attention to improve semantic correlation in geometric distributions. This module works within single view and across stereo views to achieve global spatial consistency. Experimental results demonstrate that Bi-SSC outperforms state-of-the-art camera-based methods on SemanticKITTI particularly excelling in those invisible and shaded areas."},

However due to the significant cross-task gap the respective fusion mechanism varies considerably in practice resulting in limited performance across subtasks. To handle this problem we propose a novel task-customized mixture of adapters (TC-MoA) for general image fusion adaptively prompting various fusion tasks in a unified model. We borrow the insight from the mixture of experts (MoE) taking the experts as efficient tuning adapters to prompt a pre-trained foundation model. These adapters are shared across different tasks and constrained by mutual information regularization ensuring compatibility with different tasks while complementarity for multi-source images. The task-specific routing networks customize these adapters to extract task-specific information from different sources with dynamic dominant intensity performing adaptive visual feature prompt fusion. Notably our TC-MoA controls the dominant intensity bias for different fusion tasks successfully unifying multiple fusion tasks in a single model. Extensive experiments show that TC-MoA outperforms the competing approaches in learning commonalities while retaining compatibility for general image fusion (multi-modal multi-exposure and multi-focus) and also demonstrating striking controllability on more generalization experiments.

As opposed to the traditional Bayesian frameworks where explicitly learned prior and data-driven distributions are required for gradient computation and combination BDM performs a seamless fusion of the two via coupled diffusion processes with learned gradient computation networks.

Current DFML methods primarily focus on the data recovery from these pre-trained models. However they suffer from slow recovery speed and overlook gaps inherent in heterogeneous pre-trained models. In response to these challenges we introduce the Faster and Better Data-Free Meta-Learning (FREE) framework which contains: (i) a meta-generator for rapidly recovering training tasks from pre-trained models; and (ii) a meta-learner for generalizing to new unseen tasks. Specifically within the module Faster Inversion via Meta-Generator each pre-trained model is perceived as a distinct task. The meta-generator can rapidly adapt to a specific task in just five steps significantly accelerating the data recovery. Furthermore we propose Better Generalization via Meta-Learner and introduce an implicit gradient alignment algorithm to optimize the meta-learner. This is achieved as aligned gradient directions alleviate potential conflicts among tasks from heterogeneous pre-trained models. Empirical experiments on multiple benchmarks affirm the superiority of our approach marking a notable speed-up (20x) and performance enhancement (1.42%   4.78%) in comparison to the state-of-the-art."},

Remarkable success has been achieved in the language domain by using reinforcement learning (RL) to maximize rewards that reflect human preference. However in the vision domain existing RL-based reward finetuning methods are limited by their instability in large-scale training rendering them incapable of generalizing to complex unseen prompts. In this paper we propose Proximal Reward Difference Prediction (PRDP) enabling stable black-box reward finetuning for diffusion models for the first time on large-scale prompt datasets with over 100K prompts. Our key innovation is the Reward Difference Prediction (RDP) objective that has the same optimal solution as the RL objective while enjoying better training stability. Specifically the RDP objective is a supervised regression objective that tasks the diffusion model with predicting the reward difference of generated image pairs from their denoising trajectories. We theoretically prove that the diffusion model that obtains perfect reward difference prediction is exactly the maximizer of the RL objective. We further develop an online algorithm with proximal updates to stably optimize the RDP objective. In experiments we demonstrate that PRDP can match the reward maximization ability of well-established RL-based methods in small-scale training. Furthermore through large-scale training on text prompts from the Human Preference Dataset v2 and the Pick-a-Pic v1 dataset PRDP achieves superior generation quality on a diverse set of complex unseen prompts whereas RL-based methods completely fail."},

In these techniques two or more randomly selected natural images are mixed together to generate an augmented image. Such methods may not only omit important portions of the input images but also introduce label ambiguities by mixing images across labels resulting in misleading supervisory signals. To address these limitations we propose DIFFUSEMIX a novel data augmentation technique that leverages a diffusion model to reshape training images supervised by our bespoke conditional prompts. First concatenation of a partial natural image and its generated counterpart is obtained which helps in avoiding the generation of unrealistic images or label ambiguities. Then to enhance resilience against adversarial attacks and improves safety measures a randomly selected structural pattern from a set of fractal images is blended into the concatenated image to form the final augmented image for training. Our empirical results on seven different datasets reveal that DIFFUSEMIX achieves superior performance compared to existing state- of-the-art methods on tasks including general classification fine-grained classification fine-tuning data scarcity and adversarial robustness."},

Existing multi-modality visual RL methods often encounter challenges in effectively extracting task-relevant information from multiple modalities while suppressing the increased noise only using indirect reward signals instead of pixel-level supervision. To tackle this we propose a Decomposed Multi-Modality Representation (DMR) framework for visual RL. It explicitly decomposes the inputs into three distinct components: combined task-relevant features (co-features) RGB-specific noise and DVS-specific noise. The co-features represent the full information from both modalities that is relevant to the RL task; the two noise components each constrained by a data reconstruction loss to avoid information leak are contrasted with the co-features to maximize their difference.

SAM follows a pipeline that separates interactive segmentation into image preprocessing through a large encoder and interactive inference via a lightweight decoder ensuring efficient real-time performance. However SAM faces stability issues in challenging samples upon this pipeline. These issues arise from two main factors. Firstly the image preprocessing disables SAM to dynamically use image-level zoom-in strategies to refocus on the target object during interaction. Secondly the lightweight decoder struggles to sufficiently integrate interactive information with image embeddings. To address these two limitations we propose FocSAM with a pipeline redesigned on two pivotal aspects. First we propose Dynamic Window Multi-head Self-Attention (Dwin-MSA) to dynamically refocus SAM's image embeddings on the target object. Dwin-MSA localizes attention computations around the target object enhancing object-related embeddings with minimal computational overhead. Second we propose Pixel-wise Dynamic ReLU (P-DyReLU) to enable sufficient integration of interactive information from a few initial clicks that have significant impacts on the overall segmentation results. Experimentally FocSAM augments SAM's interactive segmentation performance to match the existing state-of-the-art method in segmentation quality requiring only about 5.6% of this method's inference time on CPUs.

Given unstructured language instructions the agent first generates textually described traffic scenarios using LLMs. These scenario descriptions are subsequently broken down into several sub-descriptions for specified details such as behaviors and locations of vehicles. The agent then distinctively transforms the textually described sub-scenarios into domain-specific languages which then generate actual code for prediction and control in simulators facilitating the creation of diverse and complex scenarios within the CARLA simulation environment. A key part of our agent is a comprehensive knowledge retrieval component which efficiently translates specific textual descriptions into corresponding domain-specific code snippets by training a knowledge database containing the scenario description and code pairs. Extensive experimental results underscore the efficacy of ChatScene in improving the safety of autonomous vehicles. For instance the scenarios generated by ChatScene show a 15% increase in collision rates compared to state-of-the-art baselines when tested against different reinforcement learning-based ego vehicles. Furthermore we show that by using our generated safety-critical scenarios to fine-tune different RL-based autonomous driving models they can achieve a 9% reduction in collision rates surpassing current SOTA methods.

DPM-solvers have achieved reduced latency and enhanced quality significantly but have posed challenges to find the exact inverse (i.e. finding the initial noise from the given image). Here we investigate the exact inversions for DPM-solvers and propose algorithms to perform them when samples are generated by the first-order as well as higher-order DPM-solvers. For each explicit denoising step in DPM-solvers we formulated the inversions using implicit methods such as gradient descent or forward step method to ensure the robustness to large classifier-free guidance unlike the prior approach using fixed-point iteration. Experimental results demonstrated that our proposed exact inversion methods significantly reduced the error of both image and noise reconstructions greatly enhanced the ability to distinguish invisible watermarks and well prevented unintended background changes consistently during image editing."},
{"title": "Towards High-fidelity Artistic Image Vectorization via Texture-Encapsulated Shape Parameterization", "authors": "Ye Chen, Bingbing Ni, Jinfan Liu, Xiaoyang Huang, Xuanhong Chen", "abstract": "We develop a novel vectorized image representation scheme accommodating both shape/geometry and texture in a decoupled way particularly tailored for reconstruction and editing tasks of artistic/design images such as Emojis and Cliparts. In the heart of this representation is a set of sparsely and unevenly located 2D control points. On one hand these points constitute a collection of parametric/vectorized geometric primitives (e.g. curves and closed shapes) describing the shape characteristics of the target image. On the other hand local texture codes in terms of implicit neural network parameters are spatially distributed into each control point yielding local coordinate-to-RGB mappings within the anchored region of each control point. In the meantime a zero-shot learning algorithm is developed to decompose an arbitrary raster image into the above representation for the sake of high-fidelity image vectorization with convenient editing ability. Extensive experiments on a series of image vectorization and editing tasks well demonstrate the high accuracy offered by our proposed method with a significantly higher image compression ratio over prior art."},

Suppose there is a mixed set containing scattered parts from various shapes. This task requires algorithms to find out every possible combination among all the parts. To address this challenge we propose the so called Gradient Field-based Auto-Regressive Sampling framework (G-FARS) tailored specifically for the 3D part grouping task. In our framework we design a gradient-field-based selection graph neural network (GNN) to learn the gradients of a log conditional probability density in terms of part selection where the condition is the given mixed part set. This innovative approach implemented through the gradient-field-based selection GNN effectively captures complex relationships among all the parts in the input. Upon completion of the training process our framework becomes capable of autonomously grouping 3D parts by iteratively selecting them from the mixed part set leveraging the knowledge acquired by the trained gradient-field-based selection GNN.

Yet efficiently rendering realistic human performance and integrating it into the rasterization pipeline remains challenging. In this paper we present HiFi4G an explicit and compact Gaussian-based approach for high-fidelity human performance rendering from dense footage. Our core intuition is to marry the 3D Gaussian representation with non-rigid tracking achieving a compact and compression-friendly representation. We first propose a dual-graph mechanism to obtain motion priors with a coarse deformation graph for effective initialization and a fine-grained Gaussian graph to enforce subsequent constraints. Then we utilize a 4D Gaussian optimization scheme with adaptive spatial-temporal regularizers to effectively balance the non-rigid prior and Gaussian updating. We also present a companion compression scheme with residual compensation for immersive experiences on various platforms. It achieves a substantial compression rate of approximately 25 times with less than 2MB of storage per frame. Extensive experiments demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach which significantly outperforms existing approaches in terms of optimization speed rendering quality and storage overhead."},
{"title": "Coherent Temporal Synthesis for Incremental Action Segmentation", "authors": "Guodong Ding, Hans Golong, Angela Yao", "abstract": "Data replay is a successful incremental learning technique for images. It prevents catastrophic forgetting by keeping a reservoir of previous data original or synthesized to ensure the model retains past knowledge while adapting to novel concepts. However its application in the video domain is rudimentary as it simply stores frame exemplars for action recognition. This paper presents the first exploration of video data replay techniques for incremental action segmentation focusing on action temporal modeling. We propose a Temporally Coherent Action (TCA) model which represents actions using a generative model instead of storing individual frames. The integration of a conditioning variable that captures temporal coherence allows our model to understand the evolution of action features over time. Therefore action segments generated by TCA for replay are diverse and temporally coherent. In a 10-task incremental setup on the Breakfast dataset our approach achieves significant increases in accuracy for up to 22% compared to the baselines."},

Training on synthetic data is expected to be beneficial but synthetically trained models often suffer from poor generalization in real domains due to domain gaps. In this work we make a key observation that introducing more distortion types in the synthetic dataset may not improve or even be harmful to generalizing authentic image quality assessment. To solve this challenge we propose distortion-guided unsupervised domain adaptation for BIQA (DGQA) a novel framework that leverages adaptive multi-domain selection via prior knowledge from distortion to match the data distribution between the source domains and the target domain thereby reducing negative transfer from the outlier source domains. Extensive experiments on two cross-domain settings (synthetic distortion to authentic distortion and synthetic distortion to algorithmic distortion) have demonstrated the effectiveness of our proposed DGQA. Besides DGQA is orthogonal to existing model-based BIQA methods and can be used in combination with such models to improve performance with less training data."},

In this paper we propose MatchU a Fuse-Describe-Match strategy for 6D pose estimation from RGB-D images. MatchU is a generic approach that fuses 2D texture and 3D geometric cues for 6D pose prediction of unseen objects. We rely on learning geometric 3D descriptors that are rotation-invariant by design. By encoding pose-agnostic geometry the learned descriptors naturally generalize to unseen objects and capture symmetries. To tackle ambiguous associations using 3D geometry only we fuse additional RGB information into our descriptor. This is achieved through a novel attention-based mechanism that fuses cross-modal information together with a matching loss that leverages the latent space learned from RGB data to guide the descriptor learning process. Extensive experiments reveal the generalizability of both the RGB-D fusion strategy as well as the descriptor efficacy. Benefiting from the novel designs MatchU surpasses all existing methods by a significant margin in terms of both accuracy and speed even without the requirement of expensive re-training or rendering."},

While this may appear to be a reasonable approach we demonstrate that doing so does not correlate to human preference when the estimated lighting is used to relight a virtual scene into a real photograph. To study this we design a controlled psychophysical experiment where human observers must choose their preference amongst rendered scenes lit using a set of lighting estimation algorithms selected from the recent literature and use it to analyse how these algorithms perform according to human perception. Then we demonstrate that none of the most popular IQA metrics from the literature taken individually correctly represent human perception. Finally we show that by learning a combination of existing IQA metrics we can more accurately represent human preference. This provides a new perceptual framework to help evaluate future lighting estimation algorithms.

As the core of open-vocabulary understanding alignment of visual content with the semantics of unbounded text has become the bottleneck of this field. To address this challenge recent works propose to utilize CLIP as an additional classifier and aggregate model predictions with CLIP classification results. Despite their remarkable progress performance of OVS methods in relevant scenarios is still unsatisfactory compared with supervised counterparts. We attribute this to the in-vocabulary embedding and domain-biased CLIP prediction. To this end we present a Semantic-assisted CAlibration Network (SCAN). In SCAN we incorporate generalized semantic prior of CLIP into proposal embedding to avoid collapsing on known categories. Besides a contextual shift strategy is applied to mitigate the lack of global context and unnatural background noise. With above designs SCAN achieves state-of-the-art performance on all popular open-vocabulary segmentation benchmarks. Furthermore we also focus on the problem of existing evaluation system that ignores semantic duplication across categories and propose a new metric called Semantic-Guided IoU (SG-IoU)."},

Despite its simplicity SketchINR outperforms existing representations at multiple tasks: (i) Encoding an entire sketch dataset into a fixed size latent vector SketchINR gives 60x and 10x data compression over raster and vector sketches respectively. (ii) SketchINR's auto-decoder provides a much higher-fidelity representation than other learned vector sketch representations and is uniquely able to scale to complex vector sketches such as FS-COCO. (iii) SketchINR supports parallelisation that can decode/render  100x faster than other learned vector representations such as SketchRNN.

{"title": "Sharingan: A Transformer Architecture for Multi-Person Gaze Following", "authors": "Samy Tafasca, Anshul Gupta, Jean-Marc Odobez", "abstract": "Gaze is a powerful form of non-verbal communication that humans develop from an early age. As such modeling this behavior is an important task that can benefit a broad set of application domains ranging from robotics to sociology. In particular the gaze following task in computer vision is defined as the prediction of the 2D pixel coordinates where a person in the image is looking. Previous attempts in this area have primarily centered on CNN-based architectures but they have been constrained by the need to process one person at a time which proves to be highly inefficient. In this paper we introduce a novel and effective multi-person transformer-based architecture for gaze prediction. While there exist prior works using transformers for multi-person gaze prediction they use a fixed set of learnable embeddings to decode both the person and its gaze target which requires a matching step afterward to link the predictions with the annotations. Thus it is difficult to quantitatively evaluate these methods reliably with the available benchmarks or integrate them into a larger human behavior understanding system. Instead we are the first to propose a multi-person transformer-based architecture that maintains the original task formulation and ensures control over the people fed as input. Our main contribution lies in encoding the person-specific information into a single controlled token to be processed alongside image tokens and using its output for prediction based on a novel multiscale decoding mechanism. Our new architecture achieves state-of-the-art results on the GazeFollow VideoAttentionTarget and ChildPlay datasets and outperforms comparable multi-person architectures with a notable margin. Our code checkpoints and data extractions will be made publicly available soon."},

This limitation hinders the visual quality of these methods when applied to real-world images. To address this issue we propose the Continuous Optical Zooming dataset (COZ) by constructing an automatic imaging system to collect images at fine-grained various focal lengths within a specific range and providing strict image pair alignment. The COZ dataset serves as a benchmark to provide real-world data for training and testing arbitrary-scale SR models. To enhance the model's robustness against real-world image degradation we propose a Local Mix Implicit network (LMI) based on the MLP-mixer architecture and meta-learning which directly learns the local texture information by simultaneously mixing features and coordinates of multiple independent points. The extensive experiments demonstrate the superior performance of the arbitrary-scale SR models trained on the COZ dataset compared to models trained on simulated data. Our LMI model exhibits the superior effectiveness compared to other models. This study is of great significance in developing more efficient algorithms and improving the performance of arbitrary-scale image SR methods in practical applications.

For more efficient ViTs recent works lessen the quadratic cost of the self-attention layer by pruning or fusing the redundant tokens. However these works faced the speed-accuracy trade-off caused by the loss of information. Here we argue that token fusion needs to consider diverse relations between tokens to minimize information loss. In this paper we propose a Multi-criteria Token Fusion (MCTF) that gradually fuses the tokens based on multi-criteria (i.e. similarity informativeness and size of fused tokens). Further we utilize the one-step-ahead attention which is the improved approach to capture the informativeness of the tokens. By training the model equipped with MCTF using a token reduction consistency we achieve the best speed-accuracy trade-off in the image classification (ImageNet1K). Experimental results prove that MCTF consistently surpasses the previous reduction methods with and without training. Specifically DeiT-T and DeiT-S with MCTF reduce FLOPs by about 44% while improving the performance (+0.5% and +0.3%) over the base model respectively. We also demonstrate the applicability of MCTF in various Vision Transformers (e.g. T2T-ViT LV-ViT) achieving at least 31% speedup without performance degradation.

However reconstructing HDR videos in high-speed conditions using single-bit spikings presents challenges due to the limited bit depth. Increasing the bit depth of the spikings is advantageous for boosting HDR performance but the readout efficiency will be decreased which is unfavorable for achieving a high frame rate (HFR) video. To address these challenges we propose a readout mechanism to obtain rolling-mixed-bit (RMB) spikings which involves interleaving multi-bit spikings within the single-bit spikings in a rolling manner thereby combining the characteristics of high bit depth and efficient readout. Furthermore we introduce RMB-Net for reconstructing HDR and HFR videos. RMB-Net comprises a cross-bit attention block for fusing mixed-bit spikings and a cross-time attention block for achieving temporal fusion. Extensive experiments conducted on synthetic and real-synthetic data demonstrate the superiority of our method. For instance pure 3-bit spikings result in 3 times of data volume whereas our method achieves comparable performance with less than 2% increase in data volume."},

However there are often multiple audio tracks that can correspond with a visual scene. Consider for example different conversations on the same crowded street. The effect of such counterfactual pairs on audiovisual representation learning has not been previously explored. To investigate this we use dubbed versions of movies and television shows to augment cross-modal contrastive learning. Our approach learns to represent alternate audio tracks differing only in speech similarly to the same video. Our results from a comprehensive set of experiments investigating different training strategies show this general approach improves performance on a range of downstream auditory and audiovisual tasks without majorly affecting linguistic task performance overall. These findings highlight the importance of considering speech variation when learning scene-level audiovisual correspondences and suggest that dubbed audio can be a useful augmentation technique for training audiovisual models toward more robust performance on diverse downstream tasks."},

It provides a more compatible reconstruction for conventional rendering engines compared with the neural radiance fields (NeRFs).

Observing the superiority of NeRFs in recovering radiance fields we propose a novel 5D Neural Plenoptic Function (NeP) based on NeRFs and ray tracing such that more accurate lighting-object interactions can be formulated via the rendering equation. We also design a material-aware cone sampling strategy to efficiently integrate lights inside the BRDF lobes with the help of pre-filtered radiance fields. Our method has two stages: the geometry of the target object and the pre-filtered environmental radiance fields are reconstructed in the first stage and materials of the target object are estimated in the second stage with the proposed NeP and material-aware cone sampling strategy.

In MoMask a hierarchical quantization scheme is employed to represent human motion as multi-layer discrete motion tokens with high-fidelity details. Starting at the base layer with a sequence of motion tokens obtained by vector quantization the residual tokens of increasing orders are derived and stored at the subsequent layers of the hierarchy. This is consequently followed by two distinct bidirectional transformers. For the base-layer motion tokens a Masked Transformer is designated to predict randomly masked motion tokens conditioned on text input at training stage. During generation (i.e. inference) stage starting from an empty sequence our Masked Transformer iteratively fills up the missing tokens; Subsequently a Residual Transformer learns to progressively predict the next-layer tokens based on the results from current layer.

Henriques, Daniel Cremers", "abstract": "We tackle the problem of 3D point cloud localization based on a few natural linguistic descriptions and introduce a novel neural network Text2Loc that fully interprets the semantic relationship between points and text. Text2Loc follows a coarse-to-fine localization pipeline: text-submap global place recognition followed by fine localization. In global place recognition relational dynamics among each textual hint are captured in a hierarchical transformer with max-pooling (HTM) whereas a balance between positive and negative pairs is maintained using text-submap contrastive learning. Moreover we propose a novel matching-free fine localization method to further refine the location predictions which completely removes the need for complicated text-instance matching and is lighter faster and more accurate than previous methods. Extensive experiments show that Text2Loc improves the localization accuracy by up to 2x over the state-of-the-art on the KITTI360Pose dataset.

StyLitGAN generates images with realistic lighting effects including cast shadows soft shadows inter-reflections and glossy effects without the need for paired or CGI data. StyLitGAN uses an intrinsic image method to decompose an image followed by a search of the latent space of a pretrained StyleGAN to identify a set of directions. By prompting the model to fix one component (e.g. albedo) and vary another (e.g. shading) we generate relighted images by adding the identified directions to the latent style codes. Quantitative metrics of change in albedo and lighting diversity allow us to choose effective directions using a forward selection process. Qualitative evaluation confirms the effectiveness of our method."},

Existing methods have been proposed to address the domain gap using the semi-supervised student-teacher framework. However a fundamental issue arises from the class imbalance in the labelled training set which can result in inaccurate pseudo-labels. The relationship between classes especially where one class is a majority and the other minority has a large impact on class bias. We propose Class-Aware Teacher (CAT) to address the class bias issue in the domain adaptation setting. In our work we approximate the class relationships with our Inter-Class Relation module (ICRm) and exploit it to reduce the bias within the model. In this way we are able to apply augmentations to highly related classes both inter- and intra-domain to boost the performance of minority classes while having minimal impact on majority classes. We further reduce the bias by implementing a class-relation weight to our classification loss. Experiments conducted on various datasets and ablation studies show that our method is able to address the class bias in the domain adaptation setting. On the Cityscapes ?

Within this realm two typical approaches are employed: rasterization and ray tracing. The rasterization-based methods enable real-time rendering at the cost of increased memory and lower fidelity. In contrast the ray-tracing-based methods yield superior quality but demand longer rendering time. We solve this problem by our HashPoint method combining these two strategies leveraging rasterization for efficient point searching and sampling and ray marching for rendering. Our method optimizes point searching by rasterizing points within the camera's view organizing them in a hash table and facilitating rapid searches. Notably we accelerate the rendering process by adaptive sampling on the primary surface encountered by the ray.

While most existing methods rely on fully-supervised learning the manual labeling of point cloud data is laborious and time-consuming. Therefore several annotation-efficient methods have been proposed to address this challenge. Although effective these methods rely on weak annotations or additional multi-modal data like images and the potential benefits inherent in the point cloud sequence are still underexplored. To this end we explore the feasibility of self-supervised motion prediction with only unlabeled LiDAR point clouds. Initially we employ an optimal transport solver to establish coarse correspondences between current and future point clouds as the coarse pseudo motion labels. Training models directly using such coarse labels leads to noticeable spatial and temporal prediction inconsistencies. To mitigate these issues we introduce three simple spatial and temporal regularization losses which facilitate the self-supervised training process effectively. Experimental results demonstrate the significant superiority of our approach over the state-of-the-art self-supervised methods. Code will be available."},

However this quality comes at significant computational cost: nearly all of these models are iterative and require running sampling multiple times with large models. This iterative process is needed to ensure that different regions of the image are not only aligned with the text prompt but also compatible with each other. In this work we propose a light-weight approach to achieving this compatibility between different regions of an image using a Markov Random Field (MRF) model. We demonstrate the effectiveness of this method on top of the latent token-based Muse text-to-image model. The MRF richly encodes the compatibility among image tokens at different spatial locations to improve quality and significantly reduce the required number of Muse sampling steps. Inference with the MRF is significantly cheaper and its parameters can be quickly learned through back-propagation by modeling MRF inference as a differentiable neural-network layer. Our full model MarkovGen uses this proposed MRF model to both speed up Muse by 1.5xand produce higher quality images by decreasing undesirable image artifacts."},

We do this by engineering special sets of input tokens that can be transformed in a continuous manner we call them Continuous 3D Words. These attributes can for example be represented as sliders and applied jointly with text prompts for fine-grained control over image generation. Given only a single mesh and a rendering engine we show that our approach can be adopted to provide continuous user control over several 3D-aware attributes including time-of-day illumination bird wing orientation dollyzoom effect and object poses.

Under domain skew the current FL approaches are biased and face two fairness problems. 1) Parameter Update Conflict: data disparity among clients leads to varying parameter importance and inconsistent update directions. These two disparities cause important parameters to potentially be overwhelmed by unimportant ones of dominant updates. It consequently results in significant performance decreases for lower-performing clients. 2) Model Aggregation Bias: existing FL approaches introduce unfair weight allocation and neglect domain diversity. It leads to biased model convergence objective and distinct performance among domains. We discover a pronounced directional update consistency in Federated Learning and propose a novel framework to tackle above issues. First leveraging the discovered characteristic we selectively discard unimportant parameter updates to prevent updates from clients with lower performance overwhelmed by unimportant parameters resulting in fairer generalization performance. Second we propose a fair aggregation objective to prevent global model bias towards some domains ensuring that the global model continuously aligns with an unbiased model. The proposed method is generic and can be combined with other existing FL methods to enhance fairness.

Certain applications in robotics and vision-based navigation require 3D perception of an object undergoing circular or spinning motion in front of a static camera such as recovering the angular velocity and shape of the object. The setting is equivalent to observing a static object with an orbiting camera. In this paper we propose event-based structure-from-orbit (eSfO) where the aim is to simultaneously reconstruct the 3D structure of a fast spinning object observed from a static event camera and recover the equivalent orbital motion of the camera. Our contributions are threefold: since state-of-the-art event feature trackers cannot handle periodic self-occlusion due to the spinning motion we develop a novel event feature tracker based on spatio-temporal clustering and data association that can better track the helical trajectories of valid features in the event data. The feature tracks are then fed to our novel factor graph-based structure-from-orbit back-end that calculates the orbital motion parameters (e.g. spin rate relative rotational axis) that minimize the reprojection error. For evaluation we produce a new event dataset of objects under spinning motion. Comparisons against ground truth indicate the efficacy of eSfO."},

However few works study the effect of the architecture of the diffusion model in the 3D point cloud resorting to the typical UNet model developed for 2D images. Inspired by the wide adoption of Transformers we study the complementary role of convolution (from UNet) and attention (from Transformers). We discover that their respective importance change according to the timestep in the diffusion process. At early stage attention has an outsized influence because Transformers are found to generate the overall shape more quickly and at later stages when adding fine detail convolution starts having a larger impact on the generated point cloud's local surface quality. In light of this observation we propose a time-varying two-stream denoising model combined with convolution layers and transformer blocks. We generate an optimizable mask from each timestep to reweigh global and local features obtaining time-varying fused features.

{"title": "SCE-MAE: Selective Correspondence Enhancement with Masked Autoencoder for Self-Supervised Landmark Estimation", "authors": "Kejia Yin, Varshanth Rao, Ruowei Jiang, Xudong Liu, Parham Aarabi, David B. Lindell", "abstract": "Self-supervised landmark estimation is a challenging task that demands the formation of locally distinct feature representations to identify sparse facial landmarks in the absence of annotated data. To tackle this task existing state-of-the-art (SOTA) methods (1) extract coarse features from backbones that are trained with instance-level self-supervised learning (SSL) paradigms which neglect the dense prediction nature of the task (2) aggregate them into memory-intensive hypercolumn formations and (3) supervise lightweight projector networks to naively establish full local correspondences among all pairs of spatial features. In this paper we introduce SCE-MAE a framework that (1) leverages the MAE [??] a region-level SSL method that naturally better suits the landmark prediction task (2) operates on the vanilla feature map instead of on expensive hypercolumns and (3) employs a Correspondence Approximation and Refinement Block (CARB) that utilizes a simple density peak clustering algorithm and our proposed Locality-Constrained Repellence Loss to directly hone only select local correspondences. We demonstrate through extensive experiments that SCE-MAE is highly effective and robust outperforming existing SOTA methods by large margins of 20%-44% on the landmark matching and 9%-15% on the landmark detection tasks."},
{"title": "Programmable Motion Generation for Open-Set Motion Control Tasks", "authors": "Hanchao Liu, Xiaohang Zhan, Shaoli Huang, Tai-Jiang Mu, Ying Shan", "abstract": "Character animation in real-world scenarios necessitates a variety of constraints such as trajectories key-frames interactions etc. Existing methodologies typically treat single or a finite set of these constraint(s) as separate control tasks. These methods are often specialized and the tasks they address are rarely extendable or customizable. We categorize these as solutions to the close-set motion control problem. In response to the complexity of practical motion control we propose and attempt to solve the open-set motion control problem. This problem is characterized by an open and fully customizable set of motion control tasks. To address this we introduce a new paradigm programmable motion generation. In this paradigm any given motion control task is broken down into a combination of atomic constraints. These constraints are then programmed into an error function that quantifies the degree to which a motion sequence adheres to them. We utilize a pre-trained motion generation model and optimize its latent code to minimize the error function of the generated motion. Consequently the generated motion not only inherits the prior of the generative model but also satisfies the requirements of the compounded constraints. Our experiments demonstrate that our approach can generate high-quality motions when addressing a wide range of unseen tasks. These tasks encompass motion control by motion dynamics geometric constraints physical laws interactions with scenes objects or the character's own body parts etc. All of these are achieved in a unified approach without the need for ad-hoc paired training data collection or specialized network designs. During the programming of novel tasks we observed the emergence of new skills beyond those of the prior model. With the assistance of large language models we also achieved automatic programming. We hope that this work will pave the way for the motion control of general AI agents."},

In this paper we make the observation that the outputs of the action detection task can be formulated as images. Thus from a novel perspective we tackle action detection via a three-image generation process to generate starting point ending point and action-class predictions as images via our proposed Action Detection Image Diffusion (ADI-Diff) framework. Furthermore since our images differ from natural images and exhibit special properties we further explore a Discrete Action-Detection Diffusion Process and a Row-Column Transformer design to better handle their processing. Our ADI-Diff framework achieves state-of-the-art results on two widely-used datasets."},

However real-world quality degradation is more complex than synthetic datasets and acquiring paired data in real-world scenarios poses significant challenges. To address these challenges we propose a novel unsupervised image deblurring framework based on self-enhancement. The framework progressively generates improved pseudo-sharp and blurry image pairs without the need for real paired datasets and the generated image pairs with higher qualities can be used to enhance the performance of the reconstructor. To ensure the generated blurry images are closer to the real blurry images we propose a novel re-degradation principal component consistency loss which enforces the principal components of the generated low-quality images to be similar to those of re-degraded images from the original sharp ones. Furthermore we introduce the self-enhancement strategy that significantly improves deblurring performance without increasing the computational complexity of network during inference. Through extensive experiments on multiple real-world blurry datasets we demonstrate the superiority of our approach over other state-of-the-art unsupervised methods."},

However the existence of complex backgrounds and multiple foreground objects make this task challenging. To address this issue we propose a guided slot attention network to reinforce spatial structural information and obtain better foreground-background separation. The foreground and background slots which are initialized with query guidance are iteratively refined based on interactions with template information. Furthermore to improve slot-template interaction and effectively fuse global and local features in the target and reference frames K-nearest neighbors filtering and a feature aggregation transformer are introduced. The proposed model achieves state-of-the-art performance on two popular datasets. Additionally we demonstrate the robustness of the proposed model in challenging scenes through various comparative experiments."},
{"title": "3D Paintbrush: Local Stylization of 3D Shapes with Cascaded Score Distillation", "authors": "Dale Decatur, Itai Lang, Kfir Aberman, Rana Hanocka", "abstract": "We present 3D Paintbrush a technique for automatically texturing local semantic regions on meshes via text descriptions. Our method is designed to operate directly on meshes producing texture maps which seamlessly integrate into standard graphics pipelines. We opt to simultaneously produce a localization map (to specify the edit region) and a texture map which conforms to it. This approach improves the quality of both the localization and the stylization. To enhance the details and resolution of the textured area we leverage multiple stages of a cascaded diffusion model to supervise our local editing technique with generative priors learned from images at different resolutions. Our technique referred to as Cascaded Score Distillation (CSD) simultaneously distills scores at multiple resolutions in a cascaded fashion enabling control over both the granularity and global understanding of the supervision. We demonstrate the effectiveness of 3D Paintbrush to locally texture different semantic regions on a variety of shapes."},

Current OOD detection approaches explore all kinds of cues to identify OOD data such as finding irregular patterns in the feature space logit space gradient space or the raw image space. Surprisingly we observe a linear trend between the OOD score produced by current OOD detection algorithms and the network features on several datasets. We conduct a thorough investigation theoretically and empirically to analyze and understand the meaning of such a linear trend in OOD detection. This paper proposes a Robust Test-time Linear method (RTL) to utilize such linear trends like a `free lunch' when we have a batch of data to perform OOD detection. By using a simple linear regression as a test time adaptation we can make a more precise OOD prediction. We further propose an online variant of the proposed method which achieves promising performance and is more practical for real applications. Theoretical analysis is given to prove the effectiveness of our methods. Extensive experiments on several OOD datasets show the efficacy of RTL for OOD detection tasks significantly improving the results of base OOD detectors.

Gerken, Hampus Linander, Heiner Spieß, Fredrik Ohlsson, Christoffer Petersson, Daniel Persson", "abstract": "High-resolution wide-angle fisheye images are becoming more and more important for robotics applications such as autonomous driving. However using ordinary convolutional neural networks or vision transformers on this data is problematic due to projection and distortion losses introduced when projecting to a rectangular grid on the plane. We introduce the HEAL-SWIN transformer which combines the highly uniform Hierarchical Equal Area iso-Latitude Pixelation (HEALPix) grid used in astrophysics and cosmology with the Hierarchical Shifted-Window (SWIN) transformer to yield an efficient and flexible model capable of training on high-resolution distortion-free spherical data. In HEAL-SWIN the nested structure of the HEALPix grid is used to perform the patching and windowing operations of the SWIN transformer enabling the network to process spherical representations with minimal computational overhead. We demonstrate the superior performance of our model on both synthetic and real automotive datasets as well as a selection of other image datasets for semantic segmentation depth regression and classification tasks.

{"title": "CityDreamer: Compositional Generative Model of Unbounded 3D Cities", "authors": "Haozhe Xie, Zhaoxi Chen, Fangzhou Hong, Ziwei Liu", "abstract": "3D city generation is a desirable yet challenging task since humans are more sensitive to structural distortions in urban environments. Additionally generating 3D cities is more complex than 3D natural scenes since buildings as objects of the same class exhibit a wider range of appearances compared to the relatively consistent appearance of objects like trees in natural scenes. To address these challenges we propose CityDreamer a compositional generative model designed specifically for unbounded 3D cities. Our key insight is that 3D city generation should be a composition of different types of neural fields: 1) various building instances and 2) background stuff such as roads and green lands. Specifically we adopt the bird's eye view scene representation and employ a volumetric render for both instance-oriented and stuff-oriented neural fields. The generative hash grid and periodic positional embedding are tailored as scene parameterization to suit the distinct characteristics of building instances and background stuff. Furthermore we contribute a suite of CityGen Datasets including OSM and GoogleEarth which comprises a vast amount of real-world city imagery to enhance the realism of the generated 3D cities both in their layouts and appearances. CityDreamer achieves state-of-the-art performance not only in generating realistic 3D cities but also in localized editing within the generated cities."},

Condurache", "abstract": "Monocular 3D lane detection has become a fundamental problem in the context of autonomous driving which comprises the tasks of finding the road surface and locating lane markings. One major challenge lies in a flexible but robust line representation capable of modeling complex lane structures while still avoiding unpredictable behavior. While previous methods rely on fully data-driven approaches we instead introduce a novel approach LaneCPP that uses a continuous 3D lane detection model leveraging physical prior knowledge about the lane structure and road geometry. While our sophisticated lane model is capable of modeling complex road structures it also shows robust behavior since physical constraints are incorporated by means of a regularization scheme that can be analytically applied to our parametric representation. Moreover we incorporate prior knowledge about the road geometry into the 3D feature space by modeling geometry-aware spatial features guiding the network to learn an internal road surface representation. In our experiments we show the benefits of our contributions and prove the meaningfulness of using priors to make 3D lane detection more robust. The results show that LaneCPP achieves state-of-the-art performance in terms of F-Score and geometric errors."},
{"title": "Ungeneralizable Examples", "authors": "Jingwen Ye, Xinchao Wang", "abstract": "The training of contemporary deep learning models heavily relies on publicly available data posing a risk of unauthorized access to online data and raising concerns about data privacy. Current approaches to creating unlearnable data involve incorporating small specially designed noises but these methods strictly limit data usability overlooking its potential usage in authorized scenarios. In this paper we extend the concept of unlearnable data to conditional data learnability and introduce UnGeneralizable Examples (UGEs). UGEs exhibit learnability for authorized users while maintaining unlearnability for potential hackers. The protector defines the authorized network and optimizes UGEs to match the gradients of the original data and its ungeneralizable version ensuring learnability. To prevent unauthorized learning UGEs are trained by maximizing a designated distance loss in a common feature space. Additionally to further safeguard the authorized side from potential attacks we introduce additional undistillation optimization. Experimental results on multiple datasets and various networks demonstrate that the proposed UGEs framework preserves data usability while reducing training performance on hacker networks even under different types of attacks."},

In this paper we introduce DPMesh an innovative framework for occluded human mesh recovery that capitalizes on the profound knowledge about object structure and spatial relationships embedded in a pre-trained text-to-image diffusion model. Unlike previous methods reliant on conventional backbones for vanilla feature extraction DPMesh seamlessly integrates the pre-trained denoising U-Net with potent priors as its image backbone and performs a single-step inference to provide occlusion-aware information. To enhance the perception capability for occluded poses DPMesh incorporates judicious guidance via condition injection which produces effective controls from 2D observations for the denoising U-Net. Furthermore we explore a dedicated noisy key-point reasoning approach to mitigate disturbances arising from occlusion and crowded scenarios. This strategy fully unleashes the perceptual capability of the diffusion prior thereby enhancing accuracy. Extensive quantitative and qualitative experiments affirm the efficacy of our framework as we outperform state-of-the-art methods on both occlusion-specific and standard datasets underscoring its ability to achieve precise and robust 3D human mesh recovery particularly in challenging scenarios involving occlusion and crowded scenes.

{"title": "Unmixing Diffusion for Self-Supervised Hyperspectral Image Denoising", "authors": "Haijin Zeng, Jiezhang Cao, Kai Zhang, Yongyong Chen, Hiep Luong, Wilfried Philips", "abstract": "Hyperspectral images (HSIs) have extensive applications in various fields such as medicine agriculture and industry. Nevertheless acquiring high signal-to-noise ratio HSI poses a challenge due to narrow-band spectral filtering. Consequently the importance of HSI denoising is substantial especially for snapshot hyperspectral imaging technology. While most previous HSI denoising methods are supervised creating supervised training datasets for the diverse scenes hyperspectral cameras and scan parameters is impractical. In this work we present Diff-Unmix a self-supervised denoising method for HSI using diffusion denoising generative models. Specifically Diff-Unmix addresses the challenge of recovering noise-degraded HSI through a fusion of Spectral Unmixing and conditional abundance generation. Firstly it employs a learnable block-based spectral unmixing strategy complemented by a pure transformer-based backbone. Then we introduce a self-supervised generative diffusion network to enhance abundance maps from the spectral unmixing block. This network reconstructs noise-free Unmixing probability distributions effectively mitigating noise-induced degradations within these components. Finally the reconstructed HSI is reconstructed through unmixing reconstruction by blending the diffusion-adjusted abundance map with the spectral endmembers. Experimental results on both simulated and real-world noisy datasets show that Diff-Unmix achieves state-of-the-art performance."},

Metzler, Jia-Bin Huang", "abstract": "The reflective nature of the human eye is an under-appreciated source of information about what the world around us looks like. By imaging the eyes of a moving person we capture multiple views of a scene outside the camera's direct line of sight through the reflections in the eyes. In this paper we reconstruct a radiance field beyond the camera's line of sight using portrait images containing eye reflections. This task is challenging due to 1) the difficulty of accurately estimating eye poses and 2) the entangled appearance of the iris textures and the scene reflections. To address these our method jointly optimizes the cornea poses the radiance field depicting the scene and the observer's eye iris texture. We further present a regularization prior on the iris texture to improve scene reconstruction quality. Through various experiments on synthetic and real-world captures featuring people with varied eye colors and lighting conditions we demonstrate the feasibility of our approach to recover the radiance field using cornea reflections."}
