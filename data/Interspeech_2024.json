{"title": "Stream-based Active Learning for Anomalous Sound Detection in Machine Condition Monitoring", "authors": "Tuan Vu Ho, Kota Dohi, Yohei Kawaguchi", "abstract": "This paper introduces an active learning (AL) framework for anomalous sound detection (ASD) in machine condition monitoring system. Typically, ASD models are trained solely on normal samples due to the scarcity of anomalous data, leading to decreased accuracy for unseen samples during inference. AL is a promising solution to solve this problem by enabling the model to learn new concepts more effectively with fewer labeled examples, thus reducing manual annotation efforts. However, its effectiveness in ASD remains unexplored. To minimize update costs and time, our proposed method focuses on updating the scoring backend of ASD system without retraining the neural network model. Experimental results on the DCASE 2023 Challenge Task 2 dataset confirm that our AL framework significantly improves ASD performance even with low labeling budgets. Moreover, our proposed sampling strategy outperforms other baselines in terms of the partial area under the receiver operating characteristic score."},
{"title": "MFF-EINV2: Multi-scale Feature Fusion across Spectral-Spatial-Temporal Domains for Sound Event Localization and Detection", "authors": "Da Mu, Zhicheng Zhang, Haobo Yue", "abstract": "Sound Event Localization and Detection (SELD) involves detecting and localizing sound events using multichannel sound recordings. Previously proposed Event-Independent Network V2 (EINV2) has achieved outstanding performance on SELD. However, it still faces challenges in effectively extracting features across spectral, spatial, and temporal domains. This paper proposes a three-stage network structure named Multi-scale Feature Fusion (MFF) module to fully extract multi-scale features across spectral, spatial, and temporal domains. The MFF module utilizes parallel subnetworks architecture to generate multi-scale spectral and spatial features. The TF-Convolution Module is employed to provide multi-scale temporal features. We incorporated MFF into EINV2 and term the proposed method as MFF-EINV2. Experimental results in 2022 and 2023 DCASE challenge task3 datasets show the effectiveness of our MFF-EINV2, which achieves state-of-the-art (SOTA) performance compared to published methods."},
{"title": "Reduce, Reuse, Recycle: Is Perturbed Data Better than Other Language Augmentation for Low Resource Self-Supervised Speech Models", "authors": "Asad Ullah, Alessandro Ragano, Andrew Hines", "abstract": "Self-supervised representation learning (SSRL) has demonstrated superior performance than supervised models for tasks including phoneme recognition. Training SSRL models poses a challenge for low-resource languages where sufficient pre-training data may not be available. A common approach is cross-lingual pre-training. Instead, we propose to use audio augmentation techniques, namely: pitch variation, noise addition, accented target language and other language speech to pre-train SSRL models in a low resource condition and evaluate phoneme recognition. Our comparisons found that a combined synthetic augmentations (noise/pitch) strategy outperformed accent and language knowledge transfer. Furthermore, we examined the scaling factor of augmented data to achieve equivalent performance to model pre-trained with target domain speech. Our findings suggest that for resource-constrained languages, combined augmentations can be a viable option than other augmentations."},
{"title": "AlignNet: Learning dataset score alignment functions to enable better training of speech quality estimators", "authors": "Jaden Pieper, Stephen Voran", "abstract": "We develop two complementary advances for training no-reference (NR) speech quality estimators with independent datasets. Multi-dataset finetuning (MDF) pretrains an NR estimator on a single dataset and then finetunes it on multiple datasets at once, including the dataset used for pretraining. AlignNet uses an AudioNet to generate intermediate score estimates before using the Aligner to map intermediate estimates to the appropriate score range. AlignNet is agnostic to the choice of AudioNet so any successful NR speech quality estimator can benefit from its Aligner. The methods can be used in tandem, and we use two studies to show that they improve on current solutions: one study uses nine smaller datasets and the other uses four larger datasets. AlignNet with MDF improves on other solutions because it efficiently and effectively removes misalignments that impair the learning process, and thus enables successful training with larger amounts of more diverse data."},
{"title": "Diversifying and Expanding Frequency-Adaptive Convolution Kernels for Sound Event Detection", "authors": "Hyeonuk Nam, Seong-Hu Kim, Deokki Min, Junhyeok Lee, Yong-Hwa Park", "abstract": "Frequency dynamic convolution (FDY conv) has shown the state-of-the-art performance in sound event detection (SED) using frequency-adaptive kernels obtained by frequency-varying combination of basis kernels. However, FDY conv lacks an explicit mean to diversify frequency-adaptive kernels, potentially limiting the performance. In addition, size of basis kernels is limited while time-frequency patterns span larger spectro-temporal range. Therefore, we propose dilated frequency dynamic convolution (DFD conv) which diversifies and expands frequency-adaptive kernels by introducing different dilation sizes to basis kernels. Experiments showed advantages of varying dilation sizes along frequency dimension, and analysis on attention weight variance proved dilated basis kernels are effectively diversified. By adapting class-wise median filter with intersection-based F1 score, proposed DFD-CRNN outperforms FDY-CRNN by 3.12% in terms of polyphonic sound detection score (PSDS)."},

YOLO is a well developed model designed for image target detection. Here we introduce YOLOv7 into pitch estimation task and improve by proposing time-frequency (TF) dual-branch into the model according to pitch perception of human auditory. An additional advantage of the model over the state-of-the-art (SOTA) models is that it only needs to add an unvoiced class without additional unvoiced/voiced detection to achieve joint pitch estimation and voiced determination. Experiments show for both music and speech, the proposed TF dual-branch can boost pitch estimation accuracy over the back-bone. Our model exhibits superior pitch estimation performance over the SOTA and shows minimal performance degradation in noisy condition. The overall accuracy on the MDB-stem-synth dataset peaks at 99.4%, and voicing determination F-score reaches 99.9%."},
{"title": "Improving Audio Classification with Low-Sampled Microphone Input: An Empirical Study Using Model Self-Distillation", "authors": "Dawei Liang, Alice Zhang, David Harwath, Edison Thomaz", "abstract": "Acoustic scene and event classification is gaining traction in mobile health and wearable applications. Traditionally, relevant research focused on high-quality inputs (sampling rates >= 16 kHz). However, lower sampling rates (e.g., 1 kHz - 2 kHz) offer enhanced privacy and reduced power consumption, crucial for continuous mobile use.  This study introduces efficient methods for optimizing pre-trained audio neural networks (PANNs) targeting low-quality audio, employing Born-Again self-distillation (BASD) and a cross-sampling-rate self-distillation (CSSD) strategy. Testing three PANNs with diverse mobile datasets reveals that both strategies boost model inference performance, yielding an absolute accuracy / F1 gain ranging from 1% to 6% compared to a baseline without distillation, while sampling at very low rates (1 kHz - 2 kHz). Notably, CSSD shows greater benefits, suggesting models trained on high-quality audio adapt better to lower resolutions, despite the shift in input quality."},

The proposed AFL-Net incorporates dynamic lip movement as an additional modality to enhance the identity distinction. Besides, unlike AVR-Net which extracts high-level representations from each modality independently, AFL-Net employs a two-step cross-attention mechanism to sufficiently fuse different modalities, resulting in more comprehensive information to enhance the performance. Moreover, we also incorporated a masking strategy during training, where the face and lip modalities are randomly obscured. This strategy enhances the impact of the audio modality on the system outputs. Experimental results demonstrate that AFL-Net outperforms state-of-the-art baselines, such as the AVR-Net and DyViSE."},
{"title": "Exploiting Wavelet Scattering Transform for an Unsupervised Speaker Diarization in Deep Neural Network Framework", "authors": "Arunav Arya, Murtiza Ali, Karan Nathwani", "abstract": "Advancements in diarization have prompted the development of supervised learning models. These models extract fixed-length embeddings from audio files of varying lengths. Despite challenges, commercial API models like Speechbrain, Resemblyzer, Whisper AI, and Pyannote have addressed this issue. However, these models typically utilize Mel-Frequency Cepstral Coefficients (MFCC) features, convolution layers, and dimension reduction techniques to create embeddings. Our proposal method introduces a Wavelet Scattering Transform (WST) that prioritizes information content, allowing users to customize the shape of embeddings according to their model requirements. Coupling WST with AutoEncoders (WST-AE) in a residual manner enhances semantic latent space representations, which can be clustered segment-wise in an unsupervised manner. Testing on AMI and VoxConverse datasets has shown a reduction in Diarization Error Rate (DER) with fewer training parameters and without the need for separate embedding models."},
{"title": "Audio Fingerprinting with Holographic Reduced Representations", "authors": "Yusuke Fujita, Tatsuya Komatsu", "abstract": "This paper proposes an audio fingerprinting model with holographic reduced representation (HRR). The proposed method reduces the number of stored fingerprints, whereas conventional neural audio fingerprinting requires many fingerprints for each audio track to achieve high accuracy and time resolution. We utilize HRR to aggregate multiple fingerprints into a composite fingerprint via circular convolution and summation, resulting in fewer fingerprints with the same dimensional space as the original. Our search method efficiently finds a combined fingerprint in which a query fingerprint exists. Using HRR's inverse operation, it can recover the relative position within a combined fingerprint, retaining the original time resolution. Experiments show that our method can reduce the number of fingerprints with modest accuracy degradation while maintaining the time resolution, outperforming simple decimation and summation-based aggregation methods."},

Moreover, the integration of audio inputs with diverse distributions and task variations poses challenges in developing generic audio-language models. In this study, we present MINT, a novel ALP framework boosting audio-language models through multi-target pre-training and instruction tuning. MINT leverages the strength of frozen pre-trained audio encoders and large language models (LLM) to improve audio-language pretraining, enabling effective transferablility to both audio-text understanding and generation tasks. To address the modality gap, we introduce Bridge-Net, a trainable module that enhances cross-modality alignment and the model’s ability to follow in- structions for a variety of audio-text tasks. Bridge-Net is pivotal within MINT, initially enhancing audio-language representation learning through a multi-target pre-training approach. Subsequently, Bridge-Net further boosts audio-to-language generative learning by integrating a frozen language model with instruction tuning. This integration empowers MINT to extract features in a flexible and effective manner, specifically tailored to the provided instructions for diverse tasks. Experimental results demonstrate that MINT attains superior performance across various audio-language understanding and generation tasks, highlighting its robust generalization capabilities even in zero-shot scenarios."},

However, conventional audio representations are still crucial for many tasks where ZS is not applicable (e.g., regression problems). Here, we explore a new representation, a general-purpose audio-language representation, that performs well in both ZS and transfer learning. To do so, we propose a new method, M2D-CLAP, which combines self-supervised learning Masked Modeling Duo (M2D) and CLAP. M2D learns an effective representation to model audio signals, and CLAP aligns the representation with text embedding. As a result, M2D-CLAP learns a versatile representation that allows for both ZS and transfer learning. Experiments show that M2D-CLAP performs well on linear evaluation, fine-tuning, and ZS classification with a GTZAN state-of-the-art of 75.17%, thus achieving a general-purpose audio-language representation."},

From these insights, we propose a novel, fully end-to-end diarization model, EEND-M2F, based on the Mask2Former architecture. Speaker representations are computed in parallel using a stack of transformer decoders, in which irrelevant frames are explicitly masked from the cross attention using predictions from previous layers. EEND-M2F is efficient, and truly end-to-end, eliminating the need for additional segmentation models or clustering algorithms. Our model achieves state-of-the-art performance on several public datasets, such as AMI, AliMeeting and RAMC. Most notably our DER of 16.07% on DIHARD-III is the first major improvement upon the challenge winning system."},
{"title": "On the Success and Limitations of Auxiliary Network Based Word-Level End-to-End Neural Speaker Diarization", "authors": "Yiling Huang, Weiran Wang, Guanlong Zhao, Hank Liao, Wei Xia, Quan Wang", "abstract": "While standard speaker diarization attempts to answer the question \"who spoke when\", many realistic applications are interested in determining \"who spoke what\". In both the conventional modularized approach and the more recent end-to-end neural diarization (EEND), an additional automatic speech recognition (ASR) model and an orchestration algorithm are required to associate speakers with recognized words. In this paper, we propose Word-level End-to-End Neural Diarization (WEEND) with auxiliary network, a multi-task learning algorithm that performs end-to-end ASR and speaker diarization in the same architecture by sharing blank logits. Such a framework allows easily adding diarization capabilities to any existing RNN-T based ASR models without Word Error Rate (WER) regressions. Experimental results demonstrate that WEEND outperforms a strong turn-based diarization baseline system on all 2-speaker short-form scenarios, with the capability to generalize to audio lengths of 5 minutes."},

This is especially true for dubbed content, which is more prone to these errors due to the added manual process of replacing the original speech with a translated version. Despite their potential benefit for dubbed media production, automatic sync detection methods are seldom explored. In this paper, we propose a Transformer-based Siamese network for dubbed audio synchronization detection. Based on a large dataset of dubbed entertainment, we demonstrate that, compared to previous methods, our approach is more robust in detecting the misalignment introduced by translated speech segments. While our method addresses the previously studied constant synchronization errors, our model is the first to handle the frequent issue of intermittent offsets."},

It reinterprets the ANC problem as a neural network optimization issue, thus allowing the use of modern machine learning tools. At the same time it also benefits from classical DSP techniques as it retains and extends the state of the art for efficient generation of anti-noise. The proposed approach leverages machine learning algorithms to learn stochastically optimal FB ANC filter coefficients under a variety of conditions and constraints that make the problem intractable for classical methods. One challenge with FB ANC filter design is to guarantee the stability of the IIR filter structure as well as the feedback loop around it. The proposed method meets this stability requirement while providing new avenues for improved system efficiency and adaptability. We demonstrate its effectiveness through simulations using real-world models."},

We examined six configurations for question generation: 1) whether reference papers should also be explicitly uploaded to the system, and 2) whether or not the questions should be generated for each keyword or each section in sequence. Surprisingly, all the students and teachers who participated in the experiment chose the simplest configuration – no explicit upload of reference papers and question generation from the entire scope of the paper. This finding led us to combine the simply-configured ChatGPT with a speech interface to create an interactive practice environment. Our system orally poses questions to a student about their papers, who responds verbally. After using this environment, all the participants strongly affirmed its effectiveness of practicing Q&A to attend future international conferences."},

Most E2E ASR models are pre-trained on adult speech, which introduces an age mismatch that can be addressed by finetuning on child data. However, due to limited availability of child datasets, fine-tuning on children’s speech may introduce new domain shifts such as speaking style mismatch. In this work, we explore mixed fine-tuning on partially matched data, namely read adult speech and spontaneous children’s speech, to improve the performance of E2E ASR on read children’s speech. We isolate the individual impact of age mismatch and speaking style mismatch and investigate the use of childrenization of read adult speech.

Moreover, we investigate finetuning strategies by comparing various data augmentation and parameter-efficient finetuning (PEFT) methods. We observe that the behaviors of these methods are different when the model size increases. For example, PEFT matches the performance of full finetuning for large models but worse for small models. To stabilize finetuning using augmented data, we propose a perturbation invariant finetuning (PIF) loss as a regularization."},

There are several reasons for such data scarcity, including expensive data collection and annotation processes, and data privacy, among others. Transforming speech signals into discrete tokens that do not carry sensitive information but capture both linguistic and acoustic information could be a solution for privacy concerns. In this study, we investigate the integration of discrete speech tokens into children’s speech recognition systems as input without significantly degrading the ASR performance. Additionally, we explored single-view and multi-view strategies for creating these discrete labels. Furthermore, we tested the models for generalization capabilities with unseen domain and nativity dataset. Results reveal that the discrete token ASR for children achieves nearly equivalent performance with an approximate 83% reduction in parameters."},

Preston, Carol Espy-Wilson", "abstract": "Childhood apraxia of speech is a genetically driven, neurodevelopmental speech sound disorder with speech deficits theorized to reflect difficulty in the spatiotemporal programming of speech movements. Therefore, this work examined how well articulatory coordination features generated from audio-estimated kinematic data distinguished speakers with childhood apraxia of speech versus non-apraxic speech sound disorder. Two correlation-based feature sets motivated by recent literature demonstrated high performance in replicated 6-fold nested cross validated studies, with no statistically significant difference between feature sets (mean AUROC = .90, σ = .04). An ablation study emphasized the importance of source-filter coordination in this population of apraxic speakers, with the source-ablated feature set performing significantly worse than the lip-ablated, the tongue-ablated, and full feature set (ΔAUROC = -.19, SE = 0.01, p < .001)."},
{"title": "How Does Alignment Error Affect Automated Pronunciation Scoring in Children's Speech?", "authors": "Prad Kadambi, Tristan Mahr, Lucas Annear, Henry Nomeland, Julie Liss, Katherine Hustad, Visar Berisha", "abstract": "Automated goodness of pronunciation scores measure deviation from typical adult speech by first phonetically segmenting speech using forced alignment and then computing phoneme likelihoods. Care must be taken to distinguish between the impact of alignment error (a spurious signal) and true acoustic deviation on the automated score. Using mixed effects modeling, we predict ∆PLLR, the difference between pronunciation scores computed using manual alignment (PLLRm) versus computed using automatic forced alignments (PLLRa). Pronunciation deviations and alignment error are both magnified in children’s speech and may be influenced by factors such as phoneme position and phoneme type. Our methodology shows that alignment error has a moderate effect on ∆PLLR, and other variables have small to no effect. Manual PLLR closely matches automatically calculated PLLR following cross utterance averaging. Thus, practical comparisons between child speakers should be very comparable across the two methods."},

The purpose of this study was to evaluate psychometric properties of a novel multimodal dialog based Affect Production Task (APT) in children and adolescents (ages 8-17) with a diagnosis of autism (N=72) or neurotypical controls (N=37). Participants completed activities designed to quantify objective facial and vocal affect production ability using audiovisual capture. Criterion, ecological, and discriminant validity were assessed. Psychometric performance across task conditions, age, sex, and race-ethnicity also was examined. Results of this initial psychometric evaluation suggest that the APT is a valid measure of affect production abilities in children and adolescents, and that psychometric performance is invariant to age, sex, or race/ethnicity."},

Our training method combines the principles of repeated and assisted close-shadowed reading. Reading assistance takes over the principles of karaoke: highlighting text units in sync with pre-recorded adult performance. The aloud reading of 66 French young pupils is studied. They were divided into 3 groups: control (repeated reading only with no assistance), trained with word highlighting vs. trained with word and breath group highlighting. All children were recorded before and after 3 weeks of training while reading both a trained and an untrained text. The results indicated that respiratory planning and pauses management improved by computer-assisted reading training. However, there was no significant transfer of these improvements to the untrained text."},

We analysed the f0, intensity and duration of utterance-initial and utterance-final words of ten speakers with latent aphasia and ten matching controls. Regression models were fitted to improve our understanding of this understudied type of very mild aphasia. The results highlighted varying degrees of differences in all three prosodic measures between groups. We also investigated the diagnostic classification of latent aphasia versus neurotypical control using random forest, aiming to build a fast and reliable tool to assist with the identification of latent aphasia. The random forest analysis also reinforced the significance of prosodic features in distinguishing latent aphasia."},

Existing research and clinical assessments primarily use indirect methods such as standardized tests, video-based facial features, and handwriting tasks, which may not directly target speech-related motor skills. In this study, we measure activity from eight facial muscles associated with speech using surface electromyography (sEMG), during carefully designed tasks. The findings reveal a higher power in the sEMG signals and a significantly greater correlation between the sEMG channels in mvASD adults (N=12) compared to age and gender-matched neurotypical controls (N=14). This suggests stronger muscle activation and greater synchrony in the discharge patterns of motor units. Further, eigenvalues derived from correlation matrices indicate lower complexity in muscle coordination in mvASD, implying fewer degrees of freedom in motor control."},

Standard automatic speech processing tools do not take speech ailments into account and are thereby not able to generate meaningful results when presented with stuttered speech as input. The automatic detection of stuttering is an integral step towards building efficient, context-aware speech processing systems. While previous approaches explore both statistical and neural approaches for stuttering detection, all of these methods are uni-modal in nature. This paper presents MMSD-Net, the first multi-modal neural framework for stuttering detection. Experiments and results demonstrate that incorporating the visual signal significantly aids stuttering detection, and our model yields an improvement of 2-17% in the F1-score over existing state-of-the-art uni-modal approaches."},

We describe our two 6.5-hour corpora then experiment with different data configurations and multi-stage tuning from pretrained multilingual models within two neural ASR architectures. We find that while the diversity in content, style, and recording quality across the two corpora presents challenges, their commonalities can sometimes be leveraged to improve ASR accuracy.

To address these challenges, we propose a Few-shot keyword-Incremental Learning with total caLibration (FILL), a novel few-shot class-incremental learning (FSCIL) approach for KWS. FSCIL trains a model with sufficient data in an initial session, followed by incremental sessions where it learns new classes with limited data. FILL employs prototype calibration throughout total sessions to enhance class separation and mitigate misclassification. Notably, it utilizes manifold mixup in the initial session to generate new classes for prototype calibration. Experimental results on two KWS datasets demonstrate that FILL outperforms three baselines in terms of average accuracy."},

In this work, we propose a method for pretraining E2E KWS systems with untranscribed data, which involves using acoustic unit discovery (AUD) to obtain discrete units for untranscribed data and then learning to locate sequences of such units in the speech. We conduct experiments across languages and AUD systems: we show that finetuning such a model significantly outperforms a model trained from scratch, and the performance improvements are generally correlated with the quality of the AUD system used for pretraining."},

Based on this empirical finding, we propose the balanced-infoNCE loss, which suppresses the emergence of over-represented modes. We show that the Wav2Vec 2.0 model trained with balanced-infoNCE loss maintains high codebook entropy and converges stably. Furthermore, through finetuning experiments on a multilingual dataset for the ASR task, we demonstrate that balanced-Wav2Vec 2.0 models exhibit superior generalization performance."},

In this paper, we propose (i) a Swap method to address pre-training and inference mismatch observed in HuBERT and (ii) incorporates Multicluster masked prediction loss for more effective utilization of the models capacity. The resulting method is, MS-HuBERT, an end-to-end self-supervised pre-training method for learning robust speech representations. It beats vanilla HuBERT on the ASR Librispeech benchmark on average by a 5% margin when evaluated on different finetuning splits. Additionally, we demonstrate that the learned embeddings obtained during pre-training encode essential information for improving performance of content based tasks such as ASR."},

Previous research has proposed a Mix-Training (MT) approach to solve the problem, however, it has never been tested in the few-shot scenario. In this paper, we investigate the possibility of using MT and other relevant methods to solve the two practical challenges together: few-shot and mixed speech. Experiments conducted on the LibriSpeech and Google Speech Command corpora demonstrate that MT is highly effective on this task when employed in either the pre-training phase or the fine-tuning phase. Moreover, combining SSL-based large-scale pre-training (HuBert) and MT fine-tuning yields very strong results in all the test conditions."},

Extensive experiments on the HiREST dataset demonstrate that 2DP-2MRC significantly outperforms existing baseline models."},

Owing to SSM, fewer dilated convolutional layers are required to capture temporal dependency in Conv-TasNet, resulting in the reduction of model complexity. We also enlarge the window length and shift of the convolutional (TasNet) frontend encoder to reduce the computational cost further; the performance decline is compensated by over-parameterization of the frontend encoder.

However, they are typically developed for limited languages, and may encounter new languages in real-world. Developing a SSL model for each new language is costly. Thus, it is vital to figure out how to efficiently adapt existed SSL models to a new language without impairing its original abilities. We propose adaptation methods which integrate LoRA to existed SSL models to extend new language. We also develop preservation strategies which include data combination and re-clustering to retain abilities on existed languages. Applied to mHuBERT, we investigate their effectiveness on speech re-synthesis task. Experiments show that our adaptation methods enable mHuBERT to be applied to a new language (Mandarin) with MOS value increased about 1.6 and the relative value of WER reduced up to 61.72%. Also, our preservation strategies ensure that the performance on both existed and new languages remains intact."},

However, the issues of seamless integration of languages within a single utterance and the thorough disentanglement of different attributes without bilingual data remains to be solved. To conquer these problems, a computation-efficient model is proposed in this paper. Firstly, the Mixture of Language Experts (MoLE) module is introduced as the encoder to extract language-specific features and fuse intra-utterance semantic information. Secondly, embedding methods together with several regularization strategies and speaker consistency constraints are utilized to ensure that the generated speech aligns with the desired accent. Experiments show that the proposed model can improve the performance of code-switching accent-controllable multilingual TTS over the baseline model in terms of fluency and naturalness."},

We develop an Estonian multi-speaker TTS system that increases prosodic variability on conversational inputs while still being able to synthesize read speech.

Driven by this, we propose a fully neural networks-based ATSM (Neural ATSM) that dynamically controls each phoneme’s speaking rate to vary from sentence to sentence. It predicts phonemelevel rates using a speaking rate predictor and flexibly modifies the scales to fit sentence context using Gaussian upsampling and attention mechanism, ensuring feature similarity with Softdynamic time warping (DTW) loss.

In response to these issues, we introduce a novel approach, LiteFocus that enhances the inference of existing audio latent diffusion models in long audio synthesis. Observed the attention pattern in self-attention, we employ a dual sparse form for attention calculation, designated as same-frequency focus and cross-frequency compensation, which curtails the attention computation under same-frequency constraints, while enhancing audio quality through cross-frequency refillment.

Interactants coordinate horizontal and vertical transitions with project markers (okay, yeah). We suggest that vertical vs. horizontal transitions are distinguished both lexically and acoustically. We predicted that acoustic features of identical markers used for different transitions (okay-vertical vs. okay-horizontal) would exhibit more dissimilarity than markers used for same transitions (okay-vertical vs. okay-vertical). We used MFCC-based dynamic time warping to measure dissimilarity between vocalisations and analysed them with a Bayesian regression model.

This paper introduces an approach that enables the use of variable-length audio inputs with AST models during both training and inference. By employing sequence packing, our method ElasticAST, accommodates any audio length during training, thereby offering flexibility across all lengths and resolutions at the inference. This flexibility allows ElasticAST to maintain evaluation capabilities at various lengths or resolutions and achieve similar performance to standard ASTs trained at specific lengths or resolutions.

Laughter segmentation, the task of accurately identifying the location of laughter in audio, necessitates precise annotation of training data. However, manual annotation is very time-consuming and data preparation is not easy. We propose a method to facilitate the creation of training data for segmenting laughter in audio. Our method automatically annotates by synthesizing laughter and adding it to arbitrary audio. It allows a large amount of data to be created because the number and positions of laughs can be set freely, and data augmentation can be applied to the laughter separately. In addition, because our method can automatically annotate arbitrary audio, it can easily create datasets for training models on new data. Evaluation shows that our segmentation model outperforms existing models trained on manually annotated datasets."},

MeMo employs two distillation modes: self- and cross-distillations, with the teacher and student having the same and different architectures, respectively. To reduce the output discrepancy caused by different architectures, we divide the projection head into self- and cross-heads so that each head is responsible for distillation in its respective mode. We also discover that contrastive learning at the embedding level is supportive only in early training stages. To address this issue, we propose dynamically stopping the contrastive learning while continuing knowledge distillation.

Despite the success of SSL speech models in improving ASR for low resource varieties, SSL pre-training alone may not bridge the gap between AAVE and MAE."},

Liu, Hung-yi Lee", "abstract": "Self-supervised learning (SSL) speech models have achieved remarkable performance in various tasks, yet the biased outcomes, especially affecting marginalized groups, raise significant concerns. Social bias refers to the phenomenon where algorithms potentially amplify disparate properties between social groups present in the data used for training. Bias in SSL models can perpetuate injustice by automating discriminatory patterns and reinforcing inequitable systems. This work reveals that prevalent SSL models inadvertently acquire biased associations. We probe how various factors, such as model architecture, size, and training methodologies, influence the propagation of social bias within these models. Finally, we explore the efficacy of debiasing SSL models through regularization techniques, specifically via model compression. Our findings reveal that employing techniques such as row-pruning and training wider, shallower models can effectively mitigate social bias within SSL model."},

SSL-based SER models are chosen for their cutting-edge performance. Our research pioneering research gender bias in SER from both upstream model and data perspectives. Our findings reveal that females exhibit slightly higher overall SER performance than males.  Modified CPC and XLS-R, two well-known SSL models, notably exhibit significant bias. Moreover, models trained with Mandarin datasets display a pronounced bias toward valence. Lastly, we find that gender-wise emotion distribution differences in training data significantly affect gender bias, while upstream model representation has a limited impact."},

We address the challenge of outliers in weights and activation tensors, known to impede quantization quality in transformer-based language and vision models.  Extending this observation to Whisper, we demonstrate that these outliers are also present when transformer-based models are trained to perform automatic speech recognition, necessitating mitigation strategies for PTQ.  We show that outliers can be reduced by a recently proposed gating mechanism in the attention blocks of the student model, enabling effective 8-bit quantization, and lower word error rates compared to student models without the gating mechanism in place."},

As such, there is interest in leveraging AI for automatic, objective assessments of clinical speech to facilitate diagnosis and treatment of speech disorders. We explore transfer learning using foundation models, focusing on the impact of layer selection for the downstream task of predicting pathological speech features. We find that selecting an optimal layer can greatly improve performance (15.8% increase in balanced accuracy per feature as compared to worst layer,  13.6% increase as compared to final layer), though the best layer varies by predicted feature and does not always generalize well to unseen data. A learned weighted sum offers comparable performance to the average best layer in-distribution (only  1.2% lower) and had strong generalization for out-of-distribution data (only 1.5% lower than the average best layer)."},

In recent years, self-supervised learning (SSL) based representations have shown great potential for addressing low-resource tasks. We utilize wav2vec 2.0 representations and English articulatory data for training AAI systems and investigates their effectiveness for a different language: Dutch. Results show that using mms-1b features can reduce the cross-lingual performance drop to less than 30%. We found that increasing model size, selecting intermediate rather than final layers, and including more pre-training data improved AAI performance. By contrast, fine-tuning on an ASR task did not. Our results therefore highlight promising prospects for implementing SSL in AAI for languages with limited articulatory data."},

This paper focuses on phonetic feature probes and investigates whether feature spreading and assimilation are evident in the speech embeddings of the transformer model. Probes are trained for place and manner of articulation and voicing features according to the IPA feature classification, and exemplar fricative consonant clusters where local assimilation would be expected are selected. By then following the articulation trajectory of all of the features during inference, we explore how the transformer model encodes coarticulation and transitions between sounds in the latent representations, by tracking not only the features with the highest activation value but also alternative activations. The patterns identified appear to be in line with expectations from the literature and demonstrate the explanatory power of such an approach."},

Existing work has examined the encoding of individual linguistic units such as phonemes in these models. Here we investigate interactions between units. Inspired by classic experiments on human speech perception, we study how Wav2Vec2 resolves phonotactic constraints. We synthesize sounds on an acoustic continuum between /l/ and /r/ and embed them in controlled contexts where only /l/, only /r/, or neither occur in English. Like humans, Wav2Vec2 models show a bias towards the phonotactically admissable category in processing such ambiguous sounds. Using simple measures to analyze model internals on the level of individual stimuli, we find that this bias emerges in early layers of the model's Transformer module. This effect is amplified by ASR finetuning but also present in fully self-supervised models. Our approach demonstrates how controlled stimulus designs can help localize specific linguistic knowledge in neural speech models."},

Dysarthria is a motor speech disorder, involving some impairments in the process of speech production. Therefore, articulatory information is important for speech techniques for this special group.However, articulatory features are difficult to extract due to challenges in annotating articulation. Recent studies explored phonemic features in Wav2vec 2.0 pretrained speech models and found they carries some articulatory-related information. Based on this investigation, this paper proposes DS-AAFE to extract more accurate articulatory features from the pretrained speech model based phonemic features. In DS-AAFE, partial articulatory features are isolated from phonemic features by being jointly optimized with ASR. Articulatory attribute detection is employed to evaluate the articulatory information in the proposed features, demonstrating a notable enhancement in the accuracy of articulatory attribute detection. Furthermore, experiments on the UASpeech and TORGO dysarthria datasets showed that the proposed features improved the ASR performance for dysarthric speech."},

This raises an interesting question about where the improvements come from other than the system combination effect. We examine the underlying mechanisms driving these gains and propose an efficient joint training approach, where E2E models are trained jointly with diverse modeling units. This methodology does not only align the strengths of both phoneme and grapheme-based models but also reveals that using these diverse modeling units in a synergistic way can significantly enhance model accuracy. Our findings offer new insights into the optimal integration of heterogeneous modeling units in the development of more robust and accurate ASR systems."},

Our study reveals that S3M representations consistently and significantly exhibit more phonetic than semantic similarity. Further, we question whether widely used intent classification datasets such as Fluent Speech Commands and Snips Smartlights are adequate for measuring semantic abilities. Our simple baseline, using only the word identity, surpasses S3M-based models. This corroborates our findings and suggests that high scores on these datasets do not necessarily guarantee the presence of semantic content."},

We show that with architectural improvements to the Transformer block, a convolution-free Transformer architecture (namely, Transformer++) can catch up with the best Conformer WER results as we scale up the training data. Moreover, we demonstrate that with large scale unsupervised pre-training, the proposed Transformer++ can achieve even better WER than the best Conformer results.

These subnets of various sizes are layer-wise pruned from the supernet, and thus, enjoy full parameter sharing.

This same pattern is present in the larger set. Our findings have implications for the choice of an ASR model when building a larger system, as the choice should be made depending on the distribution of disfluent nodes present in the data."},

Focusing on verbatim features and AAE morphosyntactic features, we investigate the interactions of these categories with how well transcripts can be compared via word error rate (WER).

These models typically adopt a unified method to model discrete speech and text tokens, followed by training a decoder-only transformer. However, they are all designed for non-streaming ASR tasks, where the entire speech utterance is needed during decoding. Hence, we introduce a decoder-only model exclusively designed for streaming recognition, incorporating a dedicated boundary token to facilitate streaming recognition and employing causal attention masking during the training phase. Furthermore, we introduce right-chunk attention and various data augmentation techniques to improve the model’s contextual modeling abilities. While achieving streaming speech recognition, experiments on the AISHELL-1 and-2 datasets demonstrate the competitive performance of our streaming approach with non-streaming decoder-only counter-parts. The code we used for this work can be found here."},

The LMs have ample expressiveness and perform efficiently. This efficiency is a suitable characteristic for streaming applications of ASR. In this work, we propose to use a decoder-only architecture for blockwise streaming ASR. In our approach, speech features are compressed using CTC output and context embedding using blockwise speech subnetwork, and are sequentially provided as prompts to the decoder. The decoder estimates the output tokens promptly at each block. To this end, we also propose a novel training scheme using random-length prefix prompts to make the model robust to the truncated prompts caused by blockwise processing. An experimental comparison shows that our proposal decoder-only streaming ASR achieves 8% relative word error rate reduction in the LibriSpeech test-other set while being twice as fast as the baseline model."},

However, we cannot optimize the model by merely accessing more future frames, as this would lead to considerable latency. In this paper, we propose Future-aware Transformer (FaT) that models long-distance future contextual dependencies by transferring information from later chunks to former chunks through look-ahead windows. Specifically, the chunk-based context is used to encode audio sequence features. On this basis, the look-ahead window provides more context information for each chunk and acts as a bridge to progressively transfer long-distance future information from later chunks to earlier ones via a future-aware distillation mechanism. Experiments on AISHELL-1 and AISHELL-2 demonstrate that the proposed method achieves superior accuracy and better streaming latency than several strong baselines."},

To this end, a speech generation framework incorporating a speaker disentanglement mechanism is employed to generate the anonymized speech. The speaker attributes are altered through adversarial perturbation applied on the speaker embedding, while human perception is preserved by controlling the intensity of perturbation.

Experiments testing the robustness of the anonymized speech against privacy attacks and speech deterioration show an overall success of this system for all languages. The results suggest that speaker embeddings trained on English data can be applied across languages, and that the anonymization performance for a language is mainly affected by the quality of the speech synthesis component used for it."},

To mitigate this issue, we propose two techniques: speaker scoring and pitch guidance allowing to control timbre and pitch contour of the generated speech. We show that the optimal choice of the prior leads to considerable improvement of similarity and a specific design of classifier guidance allows for fine-grained pitch control with high naturalness.

Conducting experiments across multiple languages at scale, we show improvements in voice toxicity classification across five languages and different toxicity categories."},

Schuller, Yoshiharu Yamamoto", "abstract": "Recognising the widest range of emotions possible is a major challenge in the task of Speech Emotion Recognition(SER), especially for complex and mixed emotions. However, due to the limited number of emotional types and uneven distribution of data within existing datasets, current SER models are typically trained and used in a narrow range of emotional types. In this paper, we propose the Emotion Open Deep Network(E-ODN) model to address this issue. Besides, we introduce a novel Open-Set Recognition method that maps sample emotional features into a three-dimensional emotional space. The method can infer unknown emotions and initialise new type weights, enabling the model to dynamically learn and infer emerging emotional types. The empirical results show that our recognition model outperforms the state-of-the-art(SOTA) models in dealing with multi-type unbalanced data, and it can also perform finer-grained emotion recognition."},

In this work, to address the ASD in the context of multi-party roundtable meetings, we propose a novel approach that incorporates the fusion of spatial information of the scenes. To leverage the multiple data sources of the scenes, our method involves generating audio spatial spectrum heatmaps from the multi-channel audio and integrating them with the panoramic images. Additionally, we propose the novel FisheyeMeeting dataset, which combines fisheye panoramic video recordings with muti-channel audio captured from a six-channel circular microphone array. By enabling the multi-modal model to capture audio-visual cues in multi-party meeting scenes, our approach achieves an impressive 89.11% mAP on the FisheyeMeeting dataset. Notably, this outperforms the current SOTA methods by a significant 2.3% mAP improvement."},

Prior studies have thus measured performance differences across groups to evaluate bias. However, when comparing results across studies, it becomes apparent that they draw contradictory conclusions, hindering progress in this area. In this paper we investigate how measurement impacts the outcomes of bias evaluations. We show empirically that bias evaluations are strongly influenced by base metrics that measure performance, by the choice of ratio or difference-based bias measure, and by the aggregation of bias measures into meta-measures. Based on our findings, we recommend the use of ratio-based bias measures, in particular when the values of base metrics are small, or when base metrics with different orders of magnitude need to be compared."},

{"title": "Do we EXPECT TO find phonetic traces for syntactic traces?", "authors": "Jonathan Him Nok Lee, Mark Liberman, Martin Salzmann", "abstract": "In syntactic theories, the existence of silent/inaudible syntactic elements, such as movement traces, has been hypothesized to impact phonetic outcomes. One classic example involves the contraction of “want to” into “wanna,” where intervening syntactic traces are thought to prevent such contraction. This study extends this inquiry to “expect to,” a similar construction but without established morpho-phonological contractions, and investigates whether there are any phonetic effects of the presence of traces. Drawing on findings from wanna- contraction, syntactic theories predict that intervening traces will hinder phonetic reduction in “expect to.” To investigate, we randomly sampled 300 utterances containing “expect to” from a corpus of NPR podcasts. Multivariate linear regression shows no relationship between the presence of intervening syntactic traces and the duration of any phones in “expect to.” However, multinomial logistic regression showed that the lenition of “expect to” (“to” /tu:/ → [tʌ] or [tɪ]) was significantly more likely to occur across intervening syntactic traces. Our findings contradict the predictions posited by syntactic theories, suggesting a more intricate interplay between syntax and phonetics."},
{"title": "Modeling probabilistic reduction across domains with Naive Discriminative Learning", "authors": "Anna Stein, Kevin Tang", "abstract": "The predictability of a word modulates its acoustic duration. Such probabilistic effects can compete across linguistic domains (segments, syllables and adjacent-word contexts e.g., frequent words with infrequent syllables) and across local and aggregate contexts (e.g., a generally unpredictable word in a predictable context). This study aims to tease apart competing effects using Naive Discriminative Learning, which incorporates cue competition. The model was trained on English conversational speech from the Buckeye Corpus, using words as outcomes and segments, syllables, and adjacent words as cues. The connections between cues and outcomes were used to predict acoustic word duration. Results show that a word's duration is more strongly predicted by its syllables than its segments, and  a word's predictability aggregated over all contexts is a stronger predictor than its specific local contexts. Our study presents a unified approach to modeling competition in probabilistic reduction."},

Recalibration is attested both segmentally and suprasegmentally, but little is known about what constrains it in lexical tone. This project investigated the effects of phonological categories and phonetic similarity on perceptual learning. We exposed Chinese listeners to pitch contours ambiguous between two tone categories (realised with a level or rising pitch contour) and lexically biased their perception to one interpretation. Crucially, the rising pitch contour could be from two different phonological tone categories. Perceptual learning was observed not only in the rising contours used for exposure but also across phonetically similar but phonologically different rising contours, suggesting that perceptual learning in tone is not constrained by phonological tone categories but is facilitated by the phonetic similarity of pitch contours."},
{"title": "Quantity-sensitivity affects recall performance of word stress", "authors": "Constantijn Kaland, Maria Lialiou", "abstract": "Previous studies showed that word stress patterns need to be lexically stored when they are highly variable. Hence, listeners are better at memorizing stress patterns in recall tasks when their native language has variable stress patterns than when their native language has fixed stress patterns. The current study hypothesizes that in quantity-sensitive stress languages, segmental information facilitates stress perception and therefore makes smaller demands on lexical storage than in languages with quantity-insensitive stress patterns. This prediction is tested in two stress recall tasks with German (var. stress, q-sensitive) and Greek (var. stress, q-insensitive) listeners. Results show that German listeners indeed perform worse than Greek listeners. The outcomes provide an important novel perspective on the interaction between segmental and suprasegmental information in speech perception and nuance lexical statistics accounts of word stress."},
{"title": "Phonological Symmetry Does Not Predict Generalization of Perceptual Adaptation to Vowels", "authors": "Zuheyra Tokac, Jennifer Cole", "abstract": "Speech perception is inherently adaptive, with context-dependent rather than fixed perceptual phoneme boundaries. Exposure to novel vowel variants in lexically biasing contexts induces lasting boundary shifts toward the novel variant. Studies have found mixed results as to whether perceptual adaptation generalizes to phonologically related vowels and suggest that phonological symmetry might predict generalization. We test this hypothesis in Turkish, which has a fully symmetrical 8-vowel inventory. Listeners were exposed to words with either lowered /i/s or raised /ɛ/s and identified vowels on /i-e/ and /u-o/ continua to assess perceptual adaptation and generalization. We found perceptual adaptation to only lowered /i/s in /i-e/ identification and no generalization of perceptual adaptation in /u-o/ identification. We argue that phonological symmetry might not be sufficient for generalization, and that vowel inventory size and organization might also play a role."},

This study aims to discover the underlying mechanisms of this evolution, specifically by investigating perceptual age-related differences in Shengzhou Wu. After conducting acoustic and articulatory analyses of checked syllables, an identification task was performed to assess the perceptual importance of F0, vowel duration, and the glottal stop coda in two generations. The results show that older individuals tend to rely more on the glottal stop coda when identifying checked syllables, whereas youngsters place more perceptual weight on vowel duration. Additionally, younger people have a reduced ability to recognize checked syllables, potentially due to their exposure to standard Mandarin. These findings suggest that the glottal stop coda may weaken and disappear before the lengthening of vowel duration in the evolution of checked syllables in Wu Chinese."},

One solution might be the Lombard effect or reverberation-induced speech. This study investigates whether the intelligibility of reverberation-induced speech depends on talkers and playback rates for OAs. Four YAs recorded sentences under quiet (Q) and reverberation (R). In R, the reverberant speech was fed back to the talkers via headphones. The playback rate was 80% (slow), 100% (original), and 120% (fast). Twenty-four OAs carried out word identification tests in reverberation. The results showed that R was significantly more intelligible than Q for two of the four talkers. Slow speech was significantly more intelligible than original and fast speech, and original speech was significantly more intelligible than fast speech. The results suggest that reverberation-induced speech might increase the intelligibility of public-address announcements for OAs."},
{"title": "Listeners' F0 preferences in quiet and stationary noise", "authors": "Olympia Simantiraki, Martin Cooke", "abstract": "Talkers - and increasingly speech output technology - typically alter speech characteristics when faced with challenging communicative conditions, but the impact of these changes on interlocutors is not fully understood. One such characteristic is fundamental frequency (F0), whose mean and range tend to increase when talking in noise or when communicating with inexperienced listeners. However, speech perception experiments have yet to demonstrate any intelligibility advantage for F0 modifications. The current study asked listeners to alter mean F0 or F0 variation with real-time feedback, in order to maximise comprehensibility in quiet and noise. Listeners chose a lower mean F0 than that of the original, and F0 variation similar to the original. Masker level had no effect on preference, suggesting that while listeners express clear choices, adjustment of F0 has no impact on intelligibility, and may instead reflect considerations such as naturalness or listening effort."},

In human conversation, emotions expressed by these two modalities are similar in healthy individuals. However, rich evidence documents that depression might affect emotional expression. Nevertheless, the consistency between spoken and semantic emotion in depressed patients has rarely been studied previously. In the present study, we investigated the consistency between emotions expressed by acoustical features and text content in depressed and healthy individuals during natural conversations. It was found that depressed patients tended to talk about negative topics in a neutral emotional tone and talk about neutral or positive topics in a depressed tone. These findings suggest that depression not only affects the emotion expression of a single modality but also results in an inconsistency between emotions expressed by these two modalities."},

Models that can predict these metrics are important tools to develop speech enhancement or compression algorithms. To make predictions in real-life situations, non-intrusive models are required which do not use a clean reference signal as additional input. This paper explores a non-intrusive model for joint prediction of listening effort and speech intelligibility, which is based on character probabilities obtained from an end-to-end automatic speech recognition system. The uncertainty of the character classification is quantified using an entropy-based measure and compared to subjective data from normal-hearing and hearing-impaired listeners. The proposed model achieves correlation values of at least 0.9 and a root-mean-square error at or below 5 percentage points for speech intelligibility, and outperforms an intrusive baseline in four out of six conditions."},
{"title": "Ethnolinguistic Identification of Vietnamese-German Heritage Speech", "authors": "Thanh Lan Truong, Andrea Weber", "abstract": "We examined whether listeners can identify the heritage of speakers based on their voices. In Experiment 1, native German listeners with and without an Asian heritage listened to sentences that had either been produced by native German speakers with a Vietnamese heritage or by Germans without any Asian heritage. Asian heritage listeners performed more accurately when speakers matched their heritage background, but they could identify German speakers with no Asian heritage with above chance accuracy. Listeners with no Asian heritage performed more accurately when the speakers had no Vietnamese background than when they did, but they could not identify speakers with a Vietnamese heritage with above chance accuracy. In Experiment 2, the pattern for German listeners with no Asian heritage was replicated with monotonized stimuli. Thus, matching heritage background facilitates ethnolinguistic identification for Vietnamese-German heritage speech, which persists even when pitch is absent."},

Applying small models on top of PANNs we obtain F1 scores of 85% and above on a held-out test set. We conduct several experiments analyzing model reliability, all of which indicate the network focuses on the actual infant cries rather than on confounding factors. We visualize the network focus to adhere to pitch contour and harmonics thereof, rendering prosody central for our model prediction.  Eventually, our models add a novel objectively obtained perspective to neonate crying analysis, while our results substantiate an extremely early vocal learning indication."},

This study focuses on the use of falling SuABT in child-directed speech for preschoolers' word learning scenarios and examines whether SuABT affects children's decoding of lexical tone. Forty-eight Mandarin-speaking preschoolers participated in an identification experiment. A total of 90 familiar monosyllabic words were designed, comprising two types of word pairs: with or without tonal contrast. The target words were embedded in the two types of boundary tones. The results indicate that complex SuABT does not impede the decoding of tonal categories but rather assists preschoolers in acquiring lexical information. Age demonstrates a correlation with the ability to decode tones under both boundary tones, with a more pronounced correlation observed under the SuABT condition. As age increases, this ability gradually stabilizes after 32 months."},

In tonal languages, F0 conveys both lexical (lexical tones) and discourse meanings (contrastive focus). Given the importance of tones in word recognition, children acquire tonal productions early before age 3, but it was unclear when and how children acquire contrastive focus. This study tested 190 7-13-year-olds and 20 adult controls. Their productions of noun phrases with and without contrastive focus were elicited and perceptually evaluated for the presence/absence of focus. The perceptual judgement revealed that the perceived accuracy improved from 76% at age 7 to 93% at age 13. The acoustic analysis on the “perceived focus” productions revealed that 7-year-olds were able to use both F0 and durational cues, although fine-tuning continues until 13 years. These findings revealed that focus acquisition in Mandarin might be a late and gradual process."},

A picture-naming task was conducted with Japanese-learning preschoolers of three and four years old. The empirical data presented in this study allow us not only to make comparisons with the data from 4 year-olds in a previous study, but also to address the devoicing patterns for the 3-year old children, which have received little attention in the developmental literature on HVD. The results of twenty children reveal distinct patterns depending on position; Word-medially, the overall occurrence of HVD increases if we compare the average HVD rates between the ages of 3 and 4, but their rate is not yet reached at the adult-like level at the age of four. Word-finally, on the other hand, the rates are overall lower than the word-medial devoicing. Further, unlike the incremental pattern observed in the rates for the word-medial devoicing, no clear developmental advancement is found in this position. The presence or absence of the developmental advancement appears to support the qualitative differences between two types of HVDs in distinct positions."},

For SSL, our approach achieves an MAE of 2.70◦ on the Spatial LibriSpeech dataset, substantially surpassing the prior benchmark of about 6.60◦. Moreover, our model can employ spatial cues to improve FSR accuracy and execute LSE by selectively attending to sounds originating from a specified direction via text prompts, even amidst overlapping speech.

To shorten the sequence length of speech tokens, acoustic byte-pair encoding (BPE) has emerged in SLM that treats speech tokens from self-supervised semantic representations as characters to further compress the token sequence. But the gain in TTS has not been fully investigated, and the proper choice of acoustic BPE remains unclear. In this work, we conduct a comprehensive study on various settings of acoustic BPE to explore its effectiveness in decoder-only TTS models with semantic speech tokens. Experiments on LibriTTS verify that acoustic BPE uniformly increases the intelligibility and diversity of synthesized speech, while showing different features across BPE settings. Hence, acoustic BPE is a favorable tool for decoder-only TTS."},

It still suffers from low speaker similarity and poor prosody naturalness. In this paper, we propose a multi-modal DSR model by leveraging neural codec language modeling to improve the reconstruction results, especially for the speaker similarity and prosody naturalness. Our proposed model consists of: (i) a multi-modal content encoder to extract robust phoneme embeddings from dysarthric speech with auxiliary visual inputs; (ii) a speaker codec encoder to extract and normalize the speaker-aware codecs from the dysarthric speech, in order to provide original timbre and normal prosody; (iii) a codec language model based speech decoder to reconstruct the speech based on the extracted phoneme embeddings and normalized codecs. Evaluations on the commonly used UASpeech corpus show that our proposed model can achieve significant improvements in terms of speaker similarity and prosody naturalness."},

For MSA-P patients, our analysis revealed a reduced open quotient and confirmed excessive pitch variation. The analysis also mitigated some hypothesis on dysphonia in early stages of PD."},

Automatic paraphasia detection can help those with Aphasia by facilitating clinical assessment and treatment planning options. However, most automatic paraphasia detection works have focused solely on binary detection, which involves recognizing only the presence or absence of a paraphasia. Multiclass paraphasia detection represents an unexplored area of research that focuses on identifying multiple types of paraphasias and where they occur in a given speech segment. We present novel approaches that use a generative pretrained transformer (GPT) to identify paraphasias from transcripts as well as two end-to-end approaches that focus on modeling both automatic speech recognition (ASR) and paraphasia classification as multiple sequences vs. a single sequence. We demonstrate that a single sequence model outperforms GPT baselines for multiclass paraphasia detection."},

We perform manual and automatic classification of these three syllables on 100 ALS and 35 healthy subjects. Manual classification is done through listening tests. Spectral and self-supervised speech cues with deep neural classifiers are used for automatic classification. Manual classification accuracies decline from 84.07% on healthy utterances to 27.41% on utterances of the most severe patients. Automatic methods are found to outperform humans achieving 15.93% and 50.37% higher accuracies (absolute), respectively.

A practical question being raised in the evaluation of cascaded automatic speech recognition (ASR) systems in LLM-powered voice assistants is how to determine whether any errors in ASR transcriptions will result in task failures for the downstream assistants. Thus, measuring ASR systems that can reflect voice assistants' perception and judgement becomes increasingly important. In this paper, we propose novel evaluation metrics by leveraging the same assistant LLM to project ASR hypotheses into a vector space and compute their semantic distances with respect to the references. We perform experiments on a curated OpenAssistant test set and demonstrate that our presented methods with semantic embeddings calculated from LLMs are superior to conventional metrics on evaluating ASR performance towards LLM based voice assistants."},

{"title": "Learning from Multiple Annotator Biased Labels in Multimodal Conversation", "authors": "Kazutoshi Shinoda, Nobukatsu Hojo, Saki Mizuno, Keita Suzuki, Satoshi Kobashikawa, Ryo Masumura", "abstract": "In multimodal conversation analysis, annotating social signals such as speakers' communication skills is inherently subjective and prone to individual annotator bias, which is annotator's tendency to assign labels based on their values. These biases can contribute to label distributions biased towards specific speakers and classes that match annotators' values, leading to degraded classification performance for minority classes and speakers. Existing methods for addressing class imbalance and dataset bias often overlook the variable biases introduced by multiple annotators, which can lead to overfitting to the majority. Thus, we propose a novel two-stage debiasing method, MAD-LM, that first learns the typical label distribution for each annotator and then promotes the learning of untypical labels. MAD-LM effectively mitigates performance degradation for the minority in a multimodal conversation dataset with multiple annotator labels, while maintaining the performance for the majority."},

In this paper, we explore the prosodic realisation of well using an unlabelled corpus of conversational speech. We use clustering to explore the variation in its prosodic realisation and identify common patterns in a data-driven manner. We synthesise the cluster centroids using controllable speech synthesis.

For this task, interaction should be modeled effectively, considering the redundancy of video and audio across frames among multiple participants. Conventional Transformer-based methods in multimodal sentiment analysis succeeded in such efficient modeling by constraining the at- tention across multimodal data streams to go through only a small set of latent fusion units (“global tokens”) that form an attention bottleneck. However, performance can be limited in the multi-person model because it needs to model interaction among a larger number of data streams based on only a single global token sequence. To address this problem, we propose a participant-pair-wise bottleneck transformer (PPBT) that involves multiple global token sequences, each of which is dedicated to a particular pair of participants and demonstrates its effect."},

To overcome these limitations, we propose an emotional cues extraction and fusion network, which consists of two stages: a modality-specific learning stage that utilizes word-level labels and prosody learning to construct emotion embedding spaces for each modality, and a two-step fusion stage for integrating multi-modal features. Moreover, the emotion features extracted by our model are also applicable to the Emotion Recognition in Conversation (ERC) task.

In particular, we utilized two dialogue strategies—predefined sequence and free-form—to guide the dialogue generation framework.

Specifically, CMD is a denoising task designed to reconstruct semantic features from noisy features within one modality by interacting features from another modality. Notably, CMD operates exclusively during model training and can be removed during inference without adding extra inference time. The experimental results demonstrate that our framework outperforms the state-of-the-art method by 2.0% in mean R@1 on the Flickr8k dataset and by 1.7% in mean R@1 on the SpokenCOCO dataset for the speech-image retrieval tasks, respectively.

We validate a novel approach which models error rates as a function of relative textual predictability, and yields a single number, k, which measures the effect of textual predictability on the recognizer. We use this method to demonstrate that a Wav2Vec 2.0-based model makes greater stronger use of textual context than a hybrid ASR model, in spite of not using an explicit language model, and also use it to shed light on recent results demonstrating poor performance of standard ASR systems on African-American English. We demonstrate that these mostly represent failures of  acoustic-phonetic modelling. We show how this approach can be used straightforwardly in diagnosing and improving ASR."},

When speaker X listens to Y fluently, it does not always mean that Y listens to X fluently. After collecting different passages read aloud by different WE speakers, the collected oral passages are shadowed by the speakers themselves to quantify their listening disfluencies. Results show that, when X listens to Y, X's listening disfluency becomes larger when Y's pronunciation deviates from X's to a larger degree. Further, a method is proposed to visualize simultaneously a) how fluently a speaker listens to WE speakers and b) how fluently the WE speakers listen to that specific speaker. With this visualization, WE speakers are grouped based on their communicability in global contexts."},

{"title": "LUPET: Incorporating Hierarchical Information Path into Multilingual ASR", "authors": "Wei Liu, Jingyong Hou, Dong Yang, Muyong Cao, Tan Lee", "abstract": "Toward high-performance multilingual automatic speech recognition (ASR), various types of linguistic information and model design have demonstrated their effectiveness independently. They include language identity (LID), phoneme information, language-specific processing modules, and cross-lingual self-supervised speech representation. It is expected that leveraging their benefits synergistically in a unified solution would further improve the overall system performance. This paper presents a novel design of a hierarchical information path, named LUPET, which sequentially encodes, from the shallow layers to deep layers, multiple aspects of linguistic and acoustic information at diverse granularity scales. The path starts from LID prediction, followed by acoustic unit discovery, phoneme sharing, and finally token recognition routed by a mixture-of-expert.  ASR experiments are carried out on 10 languages in the Common Voice corpus. The results demonstrate the superior performance of LUPET as compared to the baseline systems. Most importantly, LUPET effectively mitigates the issue of performance compromise of high-resource languages with low-resource ones in the multilingual setting."},

To this end, OWSM models are trained on 25 public speech datasets, which are heterogeneous in multiple ways. In this study, we advance the OWSM series by introducing OWSM v3.2, which improves on prior models by investigating and addressing the impacts of this data heterogeneity. Our study begins with a detailed analysis of each dataset, from which we derive two key strategies: data filtering with proxy task to enhance data quality, and the incorporation of punctuation and true-casing using an open large language model (LLM). With all other configurations staying the same, OWSM v3.2 improves performance over the OWSM v3.1 baseline while using 15% less training data."},

However, effectively aligning speech representations with the LLMs remains a challenge. In this paper, we explore the potential of connecting a speech pretrained model with a decoder-only LLM for the ASR task under the encoder-decoder framework. We employ a word boundary-aware compression method along with the optimal transport algorithm to mitigate the modality gap between speech and text in both length and semantic. Experiments conducted on the LibriSpeech dataset demonstrate that our proposed method achieves satisfactory results compared to mainstream End-to-End ASR models."},

This paper proposes LoRA-Whisper, which incorporates LoRA matrix into Whisper for multilingual ASR, effectively mitigating language interference. Furthermore, by leveraging LoRA and the similarities between languages, we can achieve better performance on new languages while upholding consistent performance on original ones.

Performing language extension on top of an existing MASR is a desirable choice. In this study, the MASR continual learning problem is probabilistically decomposed into language identity prediction (LP) and cross-lingual adaptation (XLA) sub-problems. Based on this, we propose an architecture-based framework for language extension that can fundamentally solve catastrophic forgetting, debudded as PELE. PELE is designed to be parameter-efficient, incrementally incorporating an add-on module to adapt to a new language. Specifically, different parameter-efficient fine-tuning (PEFT) modules and their variants are explored as potential candidates to perform XLA. Experiments are carried out on 5 new languages with a wide range of low-resourced data sizes. The best-performing PEFT candidate can achieve satisfactory performance across all languages and demonstrates superiority in three of five languages over the continual joint learning setting. Notably, PEFT methods focusing on weight parameters or input features are revealed to be limited in performance, showing significantly inferior extension capabilities compared to inserting a lightweight module in between layers such as an Adapter."},

We hypothesize that employing explicit biasing loss as an auxiliary task in the encoder intermediate layers may better align text tokens or audio frames with the desired objectives. Our proposed intermediate biasing loss brings more regularization and contextualization to the network. Our method outperforms a conventional contextual biasing baseline on the LibriSpeech corpus, achieving a relative improvement of 22.5% in biased word error rate (B-WER) and up to 44% compared to the non-contextual baseline with a biasing list size of 100.

Moreover, they usually require complicated networks to generate speech with substantial time consumption. In this paper, we are inspired by the quasi-harmonic model (QHM) and propose a neural vocoder incorporating QHM for network architectures. In this way, speech signals can be parameterized into quasi-harmonic components and be arbitrarily resynthesized with a high quality where the time consumption and network size prominently decrease. The experiments indicate that the proposed method combines the advantages of QHM and neural vocoders and outperforms other methods, such as HiFi-GAN, in terms of generation speed and quality."},

For this, we introduce enhancement models that exploit the widely used PESQ measure. Our “PESQetarian” model achieves 3.82 PESQ on VB-DMD while scoring very poorly in a listening experiment. While the obtained PESQ value of 3.82 would imply “state-of-the-art” PESQ-performance on the VB-DMD benchmark, our examples show that when optimizing w.r.t. a metric, an isolated evaluation on the same metric may be misleading. Instead, other metrics should be included in the evaluation and the resulting performance predictions should be confirmed by listening."},

In our method, a backbone model is trained to disentangle the identity- and age-related embeddings from speaker information, and an MI estimator is trained to minimize the correlation between age- and identity-related embeddings via MI minimization, resulting in age-invariant speaker embeddings. Furthermore, by using the age gaps between positive and negative samples, we propose an aging-aware MI minimization loss function that allows the backbone model to focus more on the vocal changes with large age gaps. Experimental results show that the proposed method outperforms other methods on multiple Cross-Age test sets of Vox-CA."},

In this paper, we propose an UDA method by leveraging the target-domain data through a self-supervised method. Firstly, we use momentum contrastive learning to effectively utilize the latent speaker labels in the target domain, enhancing intra-speaker compactness and inter-speaker separability simultaneously. Secondly, we improve the inter-speaker feature distribution alignment loss, ensuring the stability of the source-domain statistics and mitigating the impact of false negative pairs. These two methods are further combined with conventional supervised learning in the source domain. Using Voxceleb2 as the source domain and CN-Celeb1 as the target domain, experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness of our proposed method."},
{"title": "CEC: A Noisy Label Detection Method for Speaker Recognition", "authors": "Yao Shen, Yingying Gao, Yaqian Hao, Chenguang Hu, Fulin Zhang, Junlan Feng, Shilei Zhang", "abstract": "Noisy labels are inevitable, even in well-annotated datasets. The detection of noisy labels is of significant importance to enhance the robustness of speaker recognition models. In this paper, we propose a novel noisy label detection approach based on two new statistical metrics: Continuous Inconsistent Counting (CIC) and Total Inconsistent Counting (TIC). These metrics are calculated through Cross-Epoch Counting (CEC) and correspond to the early and late stages of training, respectively. Additionally, we categorize samples based on their prediction results into three categories: inconsistent samples, hard samples, and easy samples. During training, we gradually increase the difficulty of hard samples to update model parameters, preventing noisy labels from being overfitted. Compared to contrastive schemes, our approach not only achieves the best performance in speaker verification but also excels in noisy label detection."},

However, such approaches suffer from false-negative issues. To address this problem, we enhance the non-contrastive DINO framework by enabling knowledge transfer from the teacher network to the student network through diversified versions of global views and call the method Within-Global-View Knowledge Transfer (W-GVKT) DINO. We discovered that given the global view of the entire utterance, creating discrepancies in the student’s output through applying spectral augmentation and feature diversification to the global view can facilitate the transfer of knowledge from the teacher to the student. With negligible computational resource increases, W-GVKT achieves an impressive EER of 4.11% without utilizing speaker labels on Voxceleb1. When combined with the RDNIO framework, W-GVKT achieved an EER of 2.89%."},
{"title": "Specializing Self-Supervised Speech Representations for Speaker Segmentation", "authors": "Séverin Baroudi, Thomas Pellegrini, Hervé Bredin", "abstract": "Self-supervised speech representation learning has been shown to be very effective for a wide range of speech processing downstream tasks. However, most of these models have been pretrained using clean pre-segmented single-speaker utterances, which is not representative of tasks involving realistic multi-speaker conversational speech like speaker diarization. WavLM pretraining mitigates this domain mismatch using artificial mixtures of single-speaker utterances, and outperforms other pretrained models such as wav2vec2 or HuBERT for speaker diarization. We propose to further specialize WavLM for speaker diarization in two ways: pretraining on real-world multi-speaker conversational speech, and crafting targets of pretraining pretext task to benefit the most to speaker diarization. When finetuned with recently proposed powerset multi-class cross entropy loss, we outperform, often by a large margin, the state-of-the-art on most speaker diarization benchmarks."},

In this archival collection each file is briefly described by a synopsis. Our objective is to develop a speaker retrieval system, treating the names mentioned in the synopses as speakers. However, the provided labels exhibit significant noise, posing challenges for model training. Further, the dataset encompasses diverse acoustic conditions, ranging from clean to highly noisy environments. To address these challenges, we develop a speaker retrieval system ``in the wild'' via leveraging pre-trained x-vector and ECAPA-TDNN embeddings models from the SpeechBrain and NeMo toolkits. We assess the effectiveness of these embeddings and explore the usefulness of their combination. Additionally, we evaluate the models' robustness against additive noise and reverberation as well as variations in bit-depth and sampling rate."},
{"title": "On the calibration of powerset speaker diarization models", "authors": "Alexis Plaquet, Hervé Bredin", "abstract": "End-to-end neural diarization models have usually relied on a multilabel-classification formulation of the speaker diarization problem. Recently, we proposed a powerset multiclass formulation that has beaten the state-of-the-art on multiple datasets. In this paper, we propose to study the calibration of a powerset speaker diarization model, and explore some of its uses. We study the calibration in-domain, as well as out-of-domain, and explore the data in low-confidence regions. The reliability of model confidence is then tested in practice: we use the confidence of the pretrained model to selectively create training and validation subsets out of unannotated data, and compare this to random selection. We find that top-label confidence can be used to reliably predict high-error regions. Moreover, training on low-confidence regions provides a better calibrated model, and validating on low-confidence regions can be more annotation-efficient than random regions."},

Fine-tuning solely on new domain risks Catastrophic Forgetting (CF). To address this, Lifelong Learning (LLL) algorithms have been proposed for ASR. Prior research has explored techniques such as Elastic Weight Consolidation, Knowledge Distillation, and Replay, all of which necessitate either additional parameters or access to prior domain data. We propose Sequential Model Editing as a novel method to continually learn new domains in ASR systems. Different than previous methods, our approach does not necessitate access to prior datasets or the introduction of extra parameters. Our study demonstrates up to 15% Word Error Rate Reduction (WERR) over fine-tuning baseline, and superior efficiency over other LLL techniques on CommonVoice English multi-accent dataset."},

Key steps are the transcription of the data via automatic speech recognition (ASR) and speaker diarization, respectively speaker role detection (SRD) to divide the transcripts into pilot and air-traffic controller (ATCO) transcripts. While traditional approaches take on these tasks separately, we propose a transformer-based joint ASR-SRD system that solves both tasks jointly while relying on a standard ASR architecture. We compare this joint system against two cascaded approaches for ASR and SRD on multiple ATC datasets. Our study shows in which cases our joint system can outperform the two traditional approaches and in which cases the other architectures are preferable. We additionally evaluate how acoustic and lexical differences influence all architectures and show how to overcome them for our joint architecture."},

Non-overlapping short segments are obtained through the first SWA and fed into the frame-level neural networks of a pre-trained SE model to extract frame-level representations. The neighboring frame-level representations are concatenated along the time axis through the second SWA, which enables an overlap between representations. The concatenated representations are used to extract multiple SEs. Additionally, we propose a fine-tuning strategy that employs a residual adapter and knowledge distillation techniques on a pre-trained SE model to refine the frame-level representation. Experimental results using two SD benchmarks show the effectiveness of the proposed extraction method with a fine-tuned SE model in terms of floating-point operations while maintaining the diarization error rate."},

Long segments may contain multiple speakers, leading to unreliable embeddings, while short segments may lack sufficient information. We propose an approach of variable segment length using a mixed segment recognition (MSR) network to address this. The MSR module distinguishes between segments with multiple speakers and those with a single speaker. Identified mixed segments are re-cut until pure or reaching the minimum length. In addition, we propose a scheme of domain-adapted feature optimization to fine-tune the pre-trained speaker embedding extractor, where both a specific data augmentation and a distance loss function are used to improve embeddings of the remaining segments still with speaker alternation and overlap. The results demonstrate the effectiveness of our method. It achieves a relative improvement of 25.5% in diarization error rate over the baseline and surpasses the recent state-of-the-art methods."},

In this paper, we propose a straightforward and effective strategy, called Hierarchical Distribution Adaptation (HDA), to address the domain bias issue. HDA leverages a hierarchical emotion representation module based on nested Transformers to extract speech emotion features at different levels (e.g., frame/segment/utterance-level), for capturing multiple-scale emotion correlations in speech. Furthermore, a hierarchical distribution adaptation module, including frame-level distribution adaptation (FDA), segment- level distribution adaptation (SDA), and utterance-level distribution adaptation (UDA), is developed to align the hierarchical-level emotion representations of the training and testing speech samples to effectively eliminate domain discrepancy. Extensive experimental results demonstrate the superiority of our proposed HDA over other state-of-the art (SOTA) methods."},

However, SE could also suppress emotionally discriminative features, affecting the emotion prediction. We propose an alternative framework, Keep or Delete (KoD), to keep the information of the original speech while minimizing the influence of background noise. We train a frame reliability predictor that determines clean frames to keep, discarding the noisy frames. We expand this framework by replacing the dropped frames with those extracted from the enhanced speech to keep the lexical information. We refer to this implementation as Keep or Substitute (KoS). Our experiment shows that the KoD model improves the SER results under noisy conditions without fine-tuning the whole model. Also, the KoS framework performs better than enhancing all the frames, indicating the importance of avoiding speech distortion."},

{"title": "Enrolment-based personalisation for improving individual-level fairness in speech emotion recognition", "authors": "Andreas Triantafyllopoulos, Björn Schuller", "abstract": "The expression of emotion is highly individualistic. However, contemporary speech emotion recognition (SER) systems typically rely on population-level models that adopt a `one-size-fits-all' approach for predicting emotion. Moreover, standard evaluation practices measure performance also on the population level, thus failing to characterise how models work across different speakers. In the present contribution, we present a new method for capitalising on individual differences to adapt an SER model to each new speaker using a minimal set of enrolment utterances. In addition, we present novel evaluation schemes for measuring fairness across different speakers. Our findings show that aggregated evaluation metrics may obfuscate fairness issues on the individual-level, which are uncovered by our evaluation, and that our proposed method can improve performance both in aggregated and disaggregated terms."},

To this end, we propose the MFDR to efficiently integrate acoustic and textual information. Specifically, acoustic-word combination and context perception are modeled sequentially in stages through the Sliding Adaptive Window Attention (SAWA) and Gated Context Perception Unit. More importantly, without additional memory overhead, SAWA allows the perception range to be adaptively adjusted according to the correlation strength to solve the misalignment and information loss caused by window truncation, modeling fusion under variable granularity. Furthermore, emotion refinement through Dynamic Frame Convolution strips out emotion-irrelevant frames, thereby generating a compact and emotionally discriminative fusion representation. The efficacy of MFDR is confirmed by IEMOCAP and CMU-MOSEI, where it demonstrates promising performance."},

However, the relationship between modelling label ambiguity and robustness to noise, and more broadly, the impact of real-world noise on CER systems remains insufficiently explored. In this study, we argue that incorporating inter-rater ambiguity during training can regularize the noise response, leading to noise robustness. To this end, we propose a novel loss function that incorporates inter-rater ambiguity into model training. Experiments conducted on the RECOLA dataset demonstrate that our proposed method achieves a maximum Concordance Correlation Coefficient (CCC) improvement of 0.117 and 0.077 for mean and standard deviation predictions, respectively, across all noise conditions. We further integrate traditional noisy augmentation strategies with our proposed method and observe promising results."},

Word-initial and word-final stop-liquid clusters in the productions of ten native French speakers were analyzed. We examined intrusive schwas' frequency, duration, and spectral properties, considering variables such as word position, liquid type, stop voicing, and place of articulation. Our results showed a significant occurrence of intrusive schwas, particularly within voiced stop-rhotic clusters. Temporal features of schwas varied depending on their position within the word, while their spectral attributes were shaped mainly by liquid type and stop place of articulation. Notable differences were observed between schwas occurring within consonant clusters and those following word-final clusters. These findings suggest that phonetic factors underlie schwa occurrences within consonant clusters, while phonological factors drive word-final schwas."},

The study also shows that voiceless laterals differ in the contexts in which they are spoken. Statistical analyses provide further support for the observed distinctions."},

Italian produces these sequences as diphthongs, i.e. /ja/ and /jo/, while Portuguese prefers hiatuses. Spanish and Romanian are claimed to use a mix of diphthongs and hiatuses. These accounts are based on phonological criteria or on small samples of carefully read isolated words. This study proposes to investigate the realisation of /ia/ and /io/ in large corpora of fluent speech, focusing on their acoustic properties along the whole formant trajectory. The results of the functional and statistical analyses show extensive acoustic variation with respect to the duration of the sequences as well as their formant dynamics. The languages clearly differ from one another, but the analysis shows that there remains more to learn about the distinction between diphthongs and hiatuses. We discuss the inclusion of further factors in future investigations."},

We investigate the locations of candidate intonation phrase boundaries in relation to syntactic boundaries, observing the phonetic-prosodic characteristics of our candidate intonation phrases in order to confirm the initial phrasing analysis and compare boundary strength associated with different syntactic boundary types. We find evidence of differential prosodic marking strategies employed in clause-final versus the clause-medial position following auxiliaries, with, for example, stronger effects of final segmental lengthening following auxiliaries compared to rather attenuated final lengthening in clause-final position."},

Phonet represents natural classes of sounds via interpretable vectors of phonological posteriors. Phonet was trained on 10 hours of Italian speech. Results show significant negative correlations between posterior probabilities for theoretically opposed classes like [open] and [close], alongside significant correlations of phonological posteriors to acoustics, e.g. values for [close] and vowels' first formant (F1). We demonstrate that Phonet’s phoneme recognition model generalizes to provide a better fit to vowel characteristics than phone labels derived from a G2P lexicon."},

Results suggest verification similarities correlate with acoustic similarities, but not with human perceptual similarities when controlled for talker pair, indicating the correlation between listeners and speaker verification models happens at a gross-phonetic level rather than a fine phonetic level."},

Acoustic properties of the speakers’ vowels in the 12-D MFCC space are compared to that of other speakers in two styles. Results show that vowels do index speaker-distinctiveness better in read vs. spontaneous speech. Furthermore, in both speech styles, distinctions between speakers are the largest for the nasal vowels. Intra-speaker variability in vowel production is also examined between speech styles and is found to depend on the speaker and on the vowel category. However, for most speakers and most vowels, the variation between styles is smaller than the distinction between speakers in both styles. Implications of these results for speaker identification are discussed."},

While previous research has made significant strides in developing models for each task individually, there has been comparatively less emphasis on concurrently learning these tasks, despite their inherent interconnectedness. As such in this demonstration, we present PERSONA, an application for predicting ER, GR, and AE with a single model in the backend. One notable point is we show that representations from speaker recognition pre-trained model (PTM) is better suited for such a multi-task learning format than the state-of-the-art (SOTA) self-supervised (SSL) PTM by carrying out a comparative study. Our methodology obviates the need for deploying separate models for each task and can potentially conserve resources and time during the training and deployment phases."},

While humor detection has traditionally centered around textual analysis, recent advancements have spotlighted multimodal approaches. However, these methods lean on textual cues as a modality, necessitating the use of ASR systems for transcribing the audio-data. This heavy reliance on ASR accuracy can pose challenges in real-world applications. To address this bottleneck, we propose an innovative audio-visual humor detection system that circumvents textual reliance, eliminating the need for ASR models. Instead, the proposed approach hinges on the intricate interplay between audio and visual content for effective humor detection."},

Two candidate properties related to the geometry of the representation space have been hypothesized to correlate well with downstream tasks: (1) the degree of orthogonality between the subspaces spanned by the speaker centroids and phone centroids, and (2) the isotropy of the space, i.e., the degree to which all dimensions are effectively utilized. To study them, we introduce a new measure, Cumulative Residual Variance (CRV), which can be used to assess both properties. Using linear classifiers for speaker and phone ID to probe the representations of six different self-supervised models and two untrained baselines, we ask whether either orthogonality or isotropy correlate with linear probing accuracy. We find that both measures correlate with phonetic probing accuracy, though our results on isotropy are more nuanced."},

Leveraging self-supervised models, we encode input audio into sequences of discrete units. Inspired by alignment algorithms from bioinformatics, we find repeated speech patterns by searching for similar sub-sequences of units. Since discretization discards speaker information, DUSTED finds better matches across speakers, improving the coverage and consistency of the discovered patterns. We demonstrate these improvements on the ZeroSpeech Challenge, achieving state-of-the-art results on the spoken-term discovery track. Finally, we analyze the duration distribution of the patterns, showing that our method finds longer word- or phrase-like terms."},

First, we argue that several assumptions lack unanimous agreement and demonstrate that existing data are problematic in multiple ways. Integrating these uncertainties and published information, we find estimates that range from 1 to 3,300 hours per year. We end by discussing how such a large possible range may impact evaluation of the plausibility and benchmarking of computational models."},

The BiLSTM-based model is trained as a phoneme classifier and takes a sequence of real articulatory trajectories as input and returns the probability of phonemes over time. The optimization minimizes a cost function which is the weighted sum of the conflicting demands of being intelligible and least articulatory effort. The data-driven intelligibility model presented in this paper is used to compute the intelligibility score. Simulations support Lindblom's hypo- and hyper-articulation theory of speech, as the degree of hyper-articulation of speech can be modified and tuned along a continuum by balancing the importance given to both requirements of intelligibility and least articulatory effort."},

We use a topologically augmented representation of the vocalizations, employing two persistence diagrams for each vocalization: one computed on the surface of its spectrogram and one on the Takens' embeddings of the vocalization. A synthetic persistent variable is derived for each diagram and added to the MFCCs (Mel-frequency cepstral coefficients). Using this representation, we fit a non-parametric Bayesian mixture model with a Dirichlet process prior to model the number of components. This procedure leads to a novel data-driven categorization of vocal productions. Our findings reveal the presence of 8 clusters of vocalizations, allowing us to compare their temporal distribution and acoustic profiles in the first 12 months of life."},

When one listens to spoken words of a foreign language and repeats them, the repeated speech is often with the accent of that listener’s L1. This is said to be because the spoken words are mentally represented as a sequence of phonological units of the L1, and those units are used for oral reproduction. We simulate this process by inputting speech of language A into GSLM of language B to add B’s accent onto the input speech. The process of running ASR of the L1 for foreign input speech and giving the ASR result to TTS of the L1 can be viewed as a naive implementation of this approach. The results of our experiments show that the synthesized accent of the output speech is highly natural, compared to real samples of A generated by speakers whose L1 is B, and that the degree of accentuation is controllable."},

To participate in this debate, we investigate whether filled pauses converge in terms of form (uh, um or mh) in the course of 5 conversations made up of 12 asymmetrical sub-conversations. Results show that each conversation displays a different pattern in the choice of the filled pause, yet none of them shows any clear evidence that participants align with their interlocutors. This indicates that, unlike other frequent words from the lexicon, filled pauses do not converge, at least in their form, and that their use is more likely speaker-oriented than hearer-oriented."},

A response timing detection experiment was conducted to evaluate the effect of utilizing text data in terms of the amount of response data. The results showed that the utilization of text data enhanced the performance of the response timing detection, especially with limited data."},

In this work, we analyze the relationship between speaker stance and conversational timing in Pacific Northwest English. We show that there are statistically significant differences in the duration of speech units, intra-speaker pauses and inter-speaker floor transfers when speech contains stance-taking behaviors. Our findings suggest that in addition to other known sources of variation in the timing of turn-taking behaviors, speaker stance measurably influences the time course of conversation."},

While many Open Intent Discovery works tackle the problem of discovering clusters of common intent, few generate a human-readable label that can be used to make decisions in downstream systems. To address this, we introduce a novel candidate label extraction method then evaluate six combinations of candidate extraction and label selection methods on three datasets.

The evaluation of continual learning algorithms typically involves assessing the model's stability, plasticity, and generalizability. However, existing continual learning metrics primarily focus on only one or two of the properties. They neglect the overall performance across all tasks, and do not adequately disentangle the plasticity versus stability/generalizability trade-offs in the model. In this work, we propose an evaluation metric that provides a unified evaluation on stability, plasticity, and generalizability. By employing the proposed metric, we demonstrate how introducing various knowledge distillations can improve these three properties, and we apply it to the SLU model evaluation. We further show that our proposed metric is more sensitive in capturing the impact of task ordering in continual learning, making it better suited for practical scenarios."},

Extending this promising approach to spoken language understanding (SLU) tasks represents  an important area of study. This paper introduces a novel RAG framework tailored for SLU called Retrieval Augmented Speech Understanding(RASU). The proposed model first employs the encoder from a pre-trained automatic speech recognition (ASR) model to retrieve relevant speech segments and transcripts from the training data given a new spoken utterance. The retrieved text transcripts and their corresponding intent labels are then formulated as prompts to conditionally guide the SLU decoder during generation. Additionally, a prompt attention mechanism is incorporated to strengthen the interaction between the generated outputs and the retrieved prompts. Empirical evaluations demonstrate that RASU substantially outperforms conventional end-to-end and cascaded SLU models on intent prediction from speech data. These results highlight the efficacy of leveraging retrieval-based prompting and external knowledge sources to markedly improve spoken language understanding performance. The RASU approach presents a promising direction for advancing SLU capabilities by bridging speech retrieval and generative language modeling."},

The former aims to select the hypothesis with the lowest error rate from a set of candidates generated by ASR for a given input speech. The latter focuses on detecting recognition errors in a given hypothesis and correcting these errors to obtain an enhanced result. However, we observe that these studies are hardly comparable to each other, as they are usually evaluated on different corpora, paired with different ASR models, and even use different datasets to train the models. Accordingly, we first concentrate on providing an ASR hypothesis revising (HypR) dataset in this study. HypR contains several commonly used corpora (AISHELL-1, TED-LIUM 2, and LibriSpeech) and provides 50 recognition hypotheses for each speech utterance. The checkpoint models of ASR are also published.

A prime exemplification is TTA for Automatic Speech Recognition (ASR), which enhances model performance by leveraging output prediction entropy minimization as a self-supervision signal. However, a key limitation of this self-supervision lies in its primary focus on acoustic features, with minimal attention to the linguistic properties of the input. To address this gap, we propose Language Informed Test-Time Adaptation (LI-TTA), which incorporates linguistic insights during TTA for ASR. LI-TTA integrates corrections from an external language model to merge linguistic with acoustic information by minimizing the CTC loss from the correction alongside the standard TTA loss. With extensive experiments, we show that LI-TTA effectively improves the performance of TTA for ASR in various distribution shift situations."},

Existing methods range from using LLMs for ASR error correction to tightly coupled systems that replace the ASR decoder with the LLM. These approaches either increase decoding time or require expensive training of the cross-attention layers. We propose SALSA, which couples the decoder layers of the ASR to the LLM decoder, while synchronously advancing both decoders. Such coupling is performed with a simple projection of the last decoder state, and is thus significantly more training efficient than earlier approaches. A challenge of our proposed coupling is handling the mismatch between the tokenizers of the LLM and ASR systems. We handle this mismatch using cascading tokenization with respect to the LLM and ASR vocabularies. We evaluate SALSA on 8 low-resource languages in the FLEURS benchmark, yielding substantial WER reductions of up to 38%."},

With better or equivalent performance for the downstream tasks of the MP3S benchmark, SummaryMixing reduces the pre-training time and peak VRAM of wav2vec 2.0 model by 18% and  by 23%, respectively, leading to the pre-training of a 155M wav2vec 2.0 model finished within one week with 4 Tesla A100 GPUs.

Their restricted parameter count limits the model’s capacity to learn, and the effectiveness of the usual training algorithms to find the best parameters. Here we show that a small convolutional model can be better trained by first refactoring its computation into a larger redundant multi-branched architecture. Then, for inference, we algebraically re-parameterize the trained model into the single-branched form with fewer parameters for a lower memory footprint and compute cost. Using this technique, we show that our always-on wake-word detector model, RepCNN, provides a good trade-off between latency and accuracy during inference. RepCNN re-parameterized models are 43% more accurate than a uni-branch convolutional model while having the same runtime. RepCNN also meets the accuracy of complex architectures like BC-ResNet, while having 2x lesser peak memory usage and 10x faster runtime."},

In this paper, we propose a novel internal acoustic model (IAM) training strategy to enhance HAT-based speech recognition. IAM consists of encoder and joint networks, which are fully shared and jointly trained with HAT. This joint training not only enhances the HAT training efficiency but also encourages IAM and HAT to emit blanks synchronously which skips the more expensive non-blank computation, resulting in more effective blank thresholding for faster decoding. Experiments demonstrate that the relative error reductions of the HAT with IAM compared to the vanilla HAT are statistically significant. Moreover, we introduce dual blank thresholding, which combines both HAT- and IAM-blank thresholding and a compatible decoding algorithm. This results in a 42-75% decoding speed-up with no major performance degradation."},
{"title": "SummaryMixing: A Linear-Complexity Alternative to Self-Attention for Speech Recognition and Understanding", "authors": "Titouan Parcollet, Rogier van Dalen, Shucong Zhang, Sourav Bhattacharya", "abstract": "Modern speech processing systems rely on self-attention. Unfortunately, token mixing with self-attention takes quadratic time in the length of the speech utterance, slowing down inference and training and increasing memory consumption. Cheaper alternatives to self-attention for ASR have been developed, but they fail to consistently reach the same level of accuracy. This paper, therefore, proposes a novel linear-time alternative to self-attention. It summarises an utterance with the mean over vectors for all time steps. This single summary is then combined with time-specific information. We call this method \"SummaryMixing\". Introducing SummaryMixing in state-of-the-art ASR models makes it feasible to preserve or exceed previous speech recognition performance while making training and inference up to 28 % faster and reducing memory use by half."},

However, the common practice of scaling model size to achieve this is becoming increasingly costly with large models. This paper proposes a novel \"contemplative mechanism\" designed to enhance encoder quality without increasing model size. Our core innovation lies in strategically interleaving special \"think tokens\" within the input sequence of speech tokens during both training and inference. This mechanism encourages deeper processing of the original input and leads to improved feature representations. We demonstrate the effectiveness of this mechanism on various speech recognition datasets and encoder architectures. Experiments show that inserting a single think token per speech token can yield accuracy gains equivalent to doubling the model size. While focused on the speech domain, our method holds promise for improving encoders in other modalities as well."},

It features two core components: the Interpreting module, which processes text and a speech prompt into semantic tokens focusing on linguistic contents and alignment, and the Speaking module, which captures the timbre of the target voice to generate acoustic tokens from semantic tokens, enriching speech reconstruction. The Interpreting stage employs a transducer for its robustness in aligning text to speech. In contrast, the Speaking stage utilizes a Conformer-based architecture integrated with a Grouped Masked Language Model (G-MLM) to boost computational efficiency. Our experiments verify that this innovative structure surpasses the conventional models in the zero-shot scenario in terms of speech quality and speaker similarity."},

This model combines audiovisual representations computed by the shared encoder with asynchronous generation of audio and visual features. Furthermore, we enhance the model with explicit predictors of lip aperture and spreading, adapted from prosodic FastSpeech2's variance adaptor. The proposed model generates mel-spectrograms and facial features (head, eyes, jaw and lip movements) to drive the virtual avatar's action units.

Specifically, the acoustic consistency constraint aims to smooth the transition between the edited region and its neighboring acoustic segments consistent with the ground truth, while the prosody consistency constraint seeks to ensure that the prosody attributes within the edited regions remain consistent with the overall style of the original utterance.

We leverage self-supervised representations that are phonetically rich as the training target for the autoregressive language model. Subsequently, a non-autoregressive model is employed to predict discrete acoustic codecs that contain fine-grained acoustic details. The TTS model focuses solely on linguistic modeling during autoregressive training, thereby reducing the error propagation that occurs in non-autoregressive training.

However, LLM-based TTS models are not robust as the generated output can contain repeating words, missing words and mis-aligned speech (referred to as hallucinations or attention errors), especially when the text contains multiple occurrences of the same token. We examine these challenges in an encoder-decoder transformer model and find that certain cross-attention heads in such models implicitly learn the text and speech alignment when trained for predicting speech tokens for a given text. To make the alignment more robust, we propose techniques utilizing CTC loss and attention priors that encourage monotonic cross-attention over the text tokens. Our guided attention training technique does not introduce any new learnable parameters and significantly improves robustness of LLM-based TTS models."},

We propose Content Extrapolation, which includes introducing Moving Average Equipped Gated Attention (MEGA) to improve the model's generalization for addressing 1) and presenting the Global-information-enhanced Classification Pause Insertion model (GCPI) to address 2). For 3), we propose LLM-based Contextual Enrichment (LLM-CE) to generate multiple sets of different contexts.

The solver uses Lagrangian points to define vocal tract boundaries on a regular grid, eliminating their stair-stepped discretization. The boundary and the flow equations interact via additional forcing terms characterized by boundary immittances. The results show that the formant frequencies of a single-segment tube closely align with its analytical solutions, exhibiting a percentage deviation of less than 3%.

We build off of recent works which have used Generative Advsarial Networks (GAN) by proposing a Transformer encoder-decoder architecture to conditionally discriminates between real and generated speech features. The discriminator is used in a training pipeline that improves both the acoustic and prosodic features of a TTS model.

However, code-mixed texts are synthesized with unnatural accents for each word because speaker-related features can include linguistic features from the speaker's source language. To solve the problems, we propose ClariTTS, which synthesizes speech with appropriate accents for the language of each word in code-mixed texts. Specifically, we propose feature-ratio normalized affine coupling layer in the flow-based TTS model, which disentangles speaker and linguistic features to prevent the accent of the target speaker's source language from being included in the target language. Furthermore, we introduce a duration stabilization training objectives to ensure stable duration prediction in code-mixed TTS. From the experimental results, we demonstrate that ClariTTS reliably generates code-mixed speech with clear pronunciation while preserving speaker identity."},

We present a method for simplifying control of style tokens by applying principal components analysis (PCA) to GST weights from a TTS system trained on both plain and clear speech. We identify the axes of variation in PCA space with the acoustic correlates of clear speech in English and show that we can synthesise either style by moving along a single dimension in that space."},

The merged model can generate an output with an intermediate feature of the base models. This method is easily applicable without specific modules or training methods, as it uses only existing trained base models. We merged two text-to-speech models to achieve attribute interpolation and evaluated its performance on speaker generation and emotion intensity control tasks. As a result, our proposed method achieved smooth attribute interpolation while keeping the linguistic content in both tasks."},

Audio-Language Models (ALM) are pre-trained on millions of audio-text pairs that may contain information about audio quality, the presence of artifacts or noise. Given an audio input and a text prompt about quality, an ALM can calculate a similarity score between the two. We exploit this capability and introduce PAM, a truly reference-free metric for assessing audio quality for different audio processing tasks. Contrary to other “reference-free” metrics, PAM does not require computing embeddings on a reference dataset nor training a task-specific model on a costly set of human listening scores. We extensively evaluate PAM against established metrics and newly collected human listening scores on four tasks: text- to-audio (TTA), text-to-music generation (TTM), text-to-speech (TTS), and deep noise suppression (DNS). We perform multiple ablation studies with controlled audio distortions, in-the-wild setups, and prompt choices. Our evaluation shows that overall, PAM correlates strongly with human listening scores and performs better than existing metrics. These results demonstrate the potential of ALM for computing a general-purpose audio quality metric. Code and human listening scores will be released."},

The gradients from a classifier for the retrieved audio features are then calculated to serve as additional guidance. Our evaluation, conducted on the DCASE 2023 challenge task 7 dataset, demonstrates that our proposed method overall improves a Frechet audio distance score."},

Unfortunately, they suffer from slow inference due to an excessive number of queries to the underlying denoising network per generation. To address this bottleneck, we introduce ConsistencyTTA, a framework requiring only a single non-autoregressive network query, thereby accelerating TTA by hundreds of times. We achieve so by proposing “CFG-aware latent consistency model,” which adapts consistency generation into a latent space and incorporates classifier-free guidance (CFG) into model training. Moreover, unlike diffusion models, ConsistencyTTA can be finetuned closed-loop with audio-space text-aware metrics, such as CLAP score, to further enhance the generations. Our objective and subjective evaluation on the AudioCaps dataset shows that compared to diffusion-based counterparts, ConsistencyTTA reduces inference computation by 400x while retaining generation quality and diversity."},

Neuromorphic devices effectively address this energy challenge. However, the general neuromorphic KWS pipeline, from microphone to Spiking Neural Network (SNN), entails multiple processing stages. Leveraging the popularity of Pulse Density Modulation (PDM) microphones in modern devices and their similarity to spiking neurons, we propose a direct microphone-to-SNN connection. This approach eliminates intermediate stages, notably reducing computational costs. The system achieved an accuracy of 91.54\\% on the Google Speech Command (GSC) dataset, surpassing the state-of-the-art for the Spiking Speech Command (SSC) dataset which is a bio-inspired encoded GSC. Furthermore, the observed sparsity in network activity and connectivity indicates potential for remarkably low energy consumption in a neuromorphic device implementation."},

While it is relatively straightforward to determine the basic room parameters from the Room Impulse Responses (RIR), doing so from a speech signal is a cumbersome task. To address this challenge, we introduce a dual-encoder architecture that facilitates the estimation of room parameters directly from speech utterances. During pre-training, one encoder receives the RIR while the other processes the reverberant speech signal. A contrastive loss function is employed to embed the speech and the acoustic response jointly. In the fine-tuning stage, the specific classification task is trained. In the test phase, only the reverberant utterance is available, and its embedding is used for the task of room shape classification. The proposed scheme is extensively evaluated using simulated acoustic environments."},

Given audio recordings from 2–4 microphones and the 3D geometry and material of a scene containing multiple unknown sound sources, we estimate the sound anywhere in the scene. We identify the main challenges of novel-view acoustic synthesis as sound source localization, separation, and dereverberation. While naively training an end-to-end network fails to produce high-quality results, we show that incorporating room impulse responses (RIRs) derived from 3D reconstructed rooms enables the same network to jointly tackle these tasks. Our method outperforms existing methods designed for the individual tasks, demonstrating its effectiveness at utilizing 3D visual information.

Simulating realistic RIRs with pure physics-driven methods often fails the balance between physical consistency and computational efficiency, hindering application to real time speech processing. Alternatively, one can use MESH2IR, a fast black-box estimator that consists of an encoder extracting latent code from mesh data with a graph convolutional network (GCN) and a decoder generating the RIR from the latent code. Combining these two approaches, we propose a fast yet physically coherent estimator with interpretable latent code based on differentiable digital signal processing (DDSP). Specifically, the encoder estimates a virtual shoebox room scene that acoustically approximates the real scene, accelerating physical simulation with the differentiable image-source model in the decoder. Our experiments showed that our method outperformed MESH2IR for real mesh data obtained with the depth scanner of Microsoft HoloLens 2, and can provide correct spatial consistency for binaural RIRs."},

To further improve the short-duration feature extraction capability of ERes2Net, we expand the channel dimension within each stage. However, this modification also increases the number of model parameters and computational complexity. To alleviate this problem, we propose an improved ERes2NetV21 by pruning redundant structures, ultimately reducing both the model parameters and its computational cost. A range of experiments conducted on the VoxCeleb datasets exhibits the superiority of ERes2NetV2, which achieves EER of 0.61% for the full duration trial, 0.98% for the 3s-duration trial, and 1.48% for the 2s-duration trial on VoxCeleb1-O, respectively."},

Such a challenge becomes even more harsh when the source data are missing. To enhance the low-resource speaker representation, this study deals with a practical scenario, called hypothesis domain adaptation, where a model trained on a source domain is adapted to a significantly different target domain as a hypothesis without access to source data. To pursue a domain-invariant representation, this paper proposes a novel collaborative hypothesis domain adaptation (CHDA) where the dual encoders are collaboratively trained to estimate the pseudo source data which are then utilized to maximize the domain confusion. Combined with the constrastive learning, this CHDA is further enhanced by increasing the domain matching as well as the speaker discrimination. The experiments on cross-language speaker recognition show the merit of the proposed method."},

Recently, a binary representation of speech extracts, where a coefficient indicates the presence or absence of a given voice attribute, has been proposed to overcome this lack. It consists of an adaptation of x-vector extractor followed by a binarisation step. This approach has proved its worth in terms of explainability, but has two shortcomings. Firstly, the objective of shared attribute modeling is indirectly taken into account. Secondly, binarization is not integrated into the modeling, but added as an afterthought. In this paper, we follow the same principle but propose a new approach that addresses the two limitations outlined above. Our proposal is based on a binary auto-encoder for restructuring conventional embeddings. The expected attribute-based behavior of the binary representation is then explicitly introduced in a new cost function. Experiments on VoxCeleb databases show the effectiveness of our proposal, with a relative reduction in EER of 47% compared to the original approach (from 3.7% to 1.96% of EER), while offering the same level of explainability."},

During the last few years, the standard softmax/cross-entropy loss has been replaced by the margin-based losses, yielding significant improvements in speaker recognition accuracy. Motivated by the fact that the margin merely reduces the logit of the target speaker during training, we consider a probabilistic framework that has a similar effect. The variational information bottleneck provides a principled mechanism for making deterministic nodes stochastic, resulting in an implicit reduction of the posterior of the target speaker. We experiment with a wide range of speaker recognition benchmarks and scoring methods and report competitive results to those obtained with the state-of-the-art Additive Angular Margin loss."},

The results presented show that deep learning beamforming gives in average an average concordance correlation coefficient (CCC) that is 15.03% higher than the ordinary minimum variance distortionless response (MVDR) beamformer when the SER system was trained with simulated conditions, which included an acoustic model of the testing HRI environment. Training by simulating the test scenarios and testing with real HRI static data provides on average an average CCC that is just 22.5% smaller than the ideal condition where training and testing were performed with the original MSP-Podcast database. This suggests the possibility to train SER engines with methods that emulates complex testing scenarios without recording further data."},

Speech emotion recognition (SER) models can suffer from particularly many sources of uncertainty, such as the ambiguity of emotions, Out-of-Distribution (OOD) data or, in general, poor recording conditions. Reliable UQ methods are thus of particular interest as in many SER applications no prediction is better than a faulty prediction. While the effects of label ambiguity on uncertainty are well documented in the literature, we focus our work on an evaluation of UQ methods for SER under common challenges in real-world application, such as corrupted signals, and the absence of speech. We show that simple UQ methods can already give an indication of the uncertainty of a prediction and that training with additional OOD data can greatly improve the identification of such signals."},

Traditional speech emotion recognition (SER) systems, which typically rely on a singular, precise emotion label, struggle with this complexity. Therefore, modeling the inherent ambiguity of emotions is an urgent problem. In this paper, we propose an iterative prototype refinement framework (IPR) for ambiguous SER. IPR comprises two interlinked components: contrastive learning and class prototypes. The former provides an efficient way to obtain high-quality representations of ambiguous samples. The latter are dynamically updated based on ambiguous labels—the similarity of the ambiguous data to all prototypes. These refined embeddings yield precise pseudo labels, thus reinforcing representation quality. Experimental evaluations conducted on the IEMOCAP dataset validate the superior performance of IPR over state-of-the-art methods, thus proving the effectiveness of our proposed method."},

In this paper, we instead focus on the fairness learning among individual speakers, which is rarely discussed yet much more intuitively appealing in constructing a fair SER model. To reduce the reliance on knowing speaker IDs, we perform unsupervised clustering on the utterance embeddings from a pretrained speaker verification model that puts utterances with different characteristics into clusters that roughly represent the true speaker index. Our evaluation demonstrates that with these cluster IDs, we can construct a fairness-aware SER model at an individual speaker-level without knowing speaker IDs upfront."},

Our work presents a systematic analysis to determine the effect of enhanced group (gender) fairness on individual fairness. Specifically, by evaluating two datasets we demonstrate that there exists a trade-off between group and individual fairness when removing group information. Moreover, our results indicate that achieving group fairness results in diminished individual fairness, particularly when the attribute distributions of the two groups are significantly distant.

However, this process omits the nuance of emotion and inter-annotator variability, which are important signals to capture. Previous work has attempted to learn distributions to capture emotion variability, but these methods also lose information about the individual annotators. We address these limitations by learning to predict individual annotators and by introducing a novel method to create distributions from continuous model outputs that permit the learning of emotion distributions during model training.  We show that this combined approach can result in emotion distributions that are more accurate than those seen in prior work, in both within- and cross-corpus settings."},

We argue (1) that when the goal is to capture periodicity or vocal-fold vibration, pitch-tracking algorithms capture F0 well, with pitch jumps possibly reflecting an important language-specific feature, and (2) that ignoring such jumps (due to assuming an error) could lead to misrepresentation of the properties of the language. To quantify these real F0 jumps, we introduce the notion of the “F0 ratio”, which identifies potential F0 jumps and helps to chart the frequency of pitch jumps in a language."},

This study addresses this issue in word-level prosodic units, aiming to identify effective acoustic cues for cross-language analysis based on the realization of metrical prominence. Findings include: (1) Within-dialect analyses reveal robust acoustic cues for realizing metrically strong units: duration, pitch height, and pitch slope for both left- and right-dominant prominence, and intensity, pitch range and cumulative pitch dynamics, an often-overlooked cue, for right-dominant one; (2) Cross-dialect analyses by Boruta algorithm identify that all these six acoustic cues are significant for the classification of Chinese dialects according to their realization of metrical prominence. Linear Discriminant Analysis emphasizes duration, intensity, and cumulative pitch dynamics as key discriminators across dialects."},

Whether these features are discriminative among sibilants and how the discrimination changes in different vowels context are not well explored. In this work, we consider two voiceless sibilants, namely, /s/ (alveolar sibilant) and /ʃ/ (palato-alveolar sibilant) in English during VCV production and show that lip aperture (LA) and lip protrusion (LP) are significantly higher in case of /ʃ/ than /s/ irrespective of the vowels (/a/, /i/, /u/) context. Using the USC Speech MRI database comprising 74 subjects speaking VCV sequence, we also show that, when used for /s/ vs /ʃ/ automatic classification, LA provides the highest classification accuracy of 90.57%(±5.91%) in case of /i/ followed by 85.09%(±5.19%) and 82.38%(±8.76%) in case of /u/ and /a/, respectively. The change in LA and LP from /s/ to /ʃ/ are seen as an effect of higher displacement of lower lip than that of upper lip for /a/ and /i/ unlike that for /u/."},

We aimed to 1) verify the differences between the characteristics of the frication noise accompanying these two sounds and 2) investigate the influence of interdentality on the frication noise features. The analysis employed features of the noise band (fricative formants, formant-related measures, and noise energies) and linear-mixed effect models. The results showed significant acoustic differences between the voiceless dental fricative and affricate. Experiments suggest that the place of articulation (dental/interdental) can also be distinguished based on the spectral features of the frication band; this finding may be employed in computer-aided speech diagnosis tools."},

However, providing them with expressiveness remains a challenge. This work proposes a methodology to modify vocal effort (VE) in the numerical simulation of vowels using a glottal source Liljencrants-Fant (LF) model and a one-dimensional acoustic model based on the finite element method. Vowels recorded with high, mid, and low VE are inverse-filtered to obtain a glottal source signal, used to estimate the LF model Rd parameter. A tuning algorithm adjusts the vocal tract geometry to match the formants of the analysed vowel. Preliminary results for the vowel /a/ are presented. Objective analyses indicate the relevance of both glottal source and vocal tract changes in reproducing VE. They are also perceptually relevant for low VE, while the glottal source predominates in high VE. Perceptual assessment validates the methodology can convey different levels of VE, particularly low and medium."},
{"title": "On The Performance of EMA-synchronized Speech and Stand-alone Speech in Acoustic-to-articulatory Inversion", "authors": "Qiang Fang", "abstract": "Synchronized acoustic-articulatory data is the basis of various applications, such as acoustic to articulatory inversion (AAI), articulatory to acoustic mapping (MAP), etc. Most of the studies in these fields directly trained various models with EMA synchronized speech, while the target input or output are stand-alone speech in real applications. However, the recording conditions of EMA-synchronized speech and stand-alone speech are different, which may make the EMA-synchronized speech different to the stand-alone speech and degrade the performance of downstream tasks. In this study, we attempt to present a general view of whether the differences affect the performance of AAI by training 3 latest AAI model with EMAsynchronize speech and testing them with both EMAsynchronized speech and stand-alone speech. The results indicate that the performance of all the 3 AAI models degrade dramatically in the sense of both Root-Mean-Square errors and Pearson’s correlation coefficients."},

Traditional EEG alignment based on acoustic vocal onset is often inaccurate due to the variable lag between articulatory and acoustic onsets. Our approach synchronizes EMA-derived speech kinematics with EEG data, addressing these challenges. We also examined the interaction between EMA and EEG systems, focusing on the integrity of EMA signals in the presence of EEG equipment and the electromagnetic influence of EMA on EEG signal quality. The method achieved a mean alignment delay of 2.7 ms (SD = 0.4 ms), enabling detailed analysis of pre-articulatory brain activities. Additionally, our evaluations confirmed the robustness of EMA signals and EEG event-related potentials, supporting the method's precision, feasibility, and reliability for speech planning research."},
{"title": "Measurement and simulation of pressure losses due to airflow in vocal tract models", "authors": "Peter Birkholz, Patrick Häsner", "abstract": "We propose a unified model for viscous and kinetic energy losses in a discrete tube model of the vocal system including the glottis. In this model, a lossless Bernoulli flow is assumed at each transition between two tube sections if the downstream section has a smaller diameter than the upstream section, and otherwise the recovery of a fixed fraction of the dynamic pressure. For viscous losses, we propose a general equation according to which the pressure drop within a tube section is inversely proportional to a certain power of its cross-sectional area. The parameters of the model were adjusted to reproduce the results of measurements with physical replicas of the glottis and the vocal tract. The best agreement with the experimental data was achieved when 29% of the dynamic pressure were recovered at tube expansions, and when the viscous losses were proportional to the tube area to the power of -2.9. These results may improve articulatory speech synthesis."},

This paper is an initial attempt to comprehensively investigate coarticulation. We leverage existing Electromagnetic Articulography (EMA) datasets to develop and train a phoneme-to-articulatory (P2A) model that can generate realistic EMA for novel phoneme sequences and replicate known coarticulation patterns. We use model-generated EMA on 9K minimal word pairs to analyze coarticulation magnitude and extent up to eight phonemes from the coarticulation trigger, and compare coarticulation resistance across different consonants. Our findings align with earlier studies and suggest a longer-range coarticulation effect than previously found. This model-based approach can potentially compare coarticulation between adults and children and across languages, offering new insights into speech production."},

This work investigates the encoding and utilization of gender in the latent representations of two transformer-based ASR models, Wav2Vec2 and HuBERT. Using linear erasure, we demonstrate the feasibility of removing gender information from each layer of an ASR model and show that such an intervention has minimal impacts on the ASR performance. Additionally, our analysis reveals a concentration of gender information within the first and last frames in the final layers, explaining the ease of erasing gender in these layers. Our findings suggest the prospect of creating gender-neutral embeddings that can be integrated into ASR frameworks without compromising their efficacy."},

This paper aims to add to our knowledge of voice quality variation and how it interacts with ASR, by conducting three analyses using a new African American English (AAE) dataset.  Acoustic analyses show robust differences between creaky voice and modal voice, suggesting cross-ethnic similarity in vocal fold articulation between AAE and Mainstream American English (MAE) speakers. In addition, we observed gender differences in creaky production both quantitatively (women > men) and qualitatively (women: medial partial creaks vs. men: final full creaks). This indicates that young AAE female speakers are participating in the phonation change taking place in MAE. We also found that the creakier the speech, the more errors in ASR output, suggesting the importance of incorporating voice quality into ASR systems."},

Effects of facial feminisation surgery on the voice are relatively understudied, however, so, little information on the vocal effects of these surgeries is available to people considering undergoing these procedures. In this single-case study, we present an acoustic analysis of speech and singing data collected from a transgender singer before and after facial feminisation surgery, alongside an examination of longitudinal interview data from the participant. Our quantitative results suggest facial feminisation surgery can have an impact on the voice, and our qualitative analysis suggests this may not only be as a result of the altered characteristics of the vocal tract, but also as a result of the altered social context. Several issues for future research are identified."},

The VVD illustrates that current approaches in speaker modeling, based on categorical notions of gender and a static understanding of vocal texture, fail to account for the flexibility of the vocal tract. Utilizing publicly-available speaker embeddings, we demonstrate that gender classification systems are highly sensitive to voice modification, and speaker verification systems fail to identify voices as coming from the same speaker as voice modification becomes more drastic. As one path towards moving beyond categorical and static notions of speaker identity, we propose modeling individual qualities of vocal texture such as pitch, resonance, and weight."},

From a diachronic corpus based on French media archives spanning 60 years from 1955 to 2015, automatic transcription and forced alignment allowed extracting the central frame of each vowel. More than one million frames were obtained from over a thousand speakers across gender and age categories. Their formants were used from these vocalic frames to fit the parameters of Maeda's articulatory model. Evaluations of the quality of these processes are provided. We focus here on two parameters of Maeda’s model linked to total vocal tract length: the relative position of the larynx (higher for females) and the lips protrusion (more protruded for males). Implications for voice quality across genders are discussed. The effect across periods seems gender independent; thus, the assertion that females lowered their pitch with time is not supported."},

This paper introduces a novel approach for constructing a palette of controllable gender-expansive TTS voices using recordings from 14 gender-expansive speakers. We employ Constrained PCA to extract gender-independent speaker identity vectors from x-vectors, using acoustic Vocal Tract Length (aVTL) as a known component. The result is applied as a speaker embedding in neural TTS, allowing control over the aVTL and several emergent properties captured as a representation of the vocal space across speakers. In addition to quantitative metrics, we present a community evaluation conducted by nonbinary SGD users."},

Findings reveal systemic gender imbalances, with women underrepresented compared to men across all descriptors. Notably, manual channel reports show higher women’s presence than automatic estimates and references to women are lower than their speech time. Descriptors share common dynamics during high and low audiences, war coverage, or private versus public channels. While women are more visible than audible in French TV, this trend is inverted in news with unseen journalists depicting male protagonists. A statistical test shows 3 main effects influencing references to women: program category, channel and speaker gender."},

To evaluate the performances of these models, we construct and annotate a dataset of 804 dialogues. This dataset is made available free of charge for research purposes.

We test the ability of a typical pipeline to capture the style known colloquially as “gay voice” and notice a homogenisation effect: synthesised speech is rated as sounding significantly “less gay” (by LGBTQ+ participants) than its corresponding ground-truth for speakers with “gay voice”, but ratings actually increase for control speakers. Loss of “gay voice” has implications for accessibility. We also find that for speakers with “gay voice”, loss of “gay voice” corresponds to lower similarity ratings. However, we caution that improving the ability of such models to synthesise “gay voice” comes with a great number of risks. We use this pipeline as a starting point for a discussion on the ethics of modelling queer voices more broadly. Collecting “clean” queer data has safety and fairness ramifications, and the resulting technology may cause harms from mockery to death."},

The challenge in training our GSQA model lies in the absence of a spoken abstractive QA dataset. We propose using text models for initialization and leveraging the extractive QA dataset to transfer knowledge from the text generative model to the spoken generative model. Experimental results indicate that our model surpasses the previous extractive model by 3% on extractive QA datasets. Furthermore, the GSQA model has only been fine-tuned on the spoken extractive QA dataset. Despite not having seen any spoken abstractive QA data, it can still closely match the performance of the cascade model. In conclusion, our GSQA model shows the potential to generalize to a broad spectrum of questions, thus further expanding the SQA capabilities of abstractive QA."},
{"title": "Contextual Interactive Evaluation of TTS Models in Dialogue Systems", "authors": "Siyang Wang, Éva Székely, Joakim Gustafson", "abstract": "Evaluation of text-to-speech (TTS) models is currently dominated by Mean-Opinion-Score (MOS) listening test, but MOS has been increasingly questioned for its validity. MOS tests place listeners in a passive setup, in which they do not actively interact with the TTS and usually evaluate isolated utterances without context. Thus it gives no indication for how well a TTS model suits an interactive application like spoken dialogue system, in which the capability of generating appropriate speech in the dialogue context is paramount. We aim to take a first step towards addressing this shortcoming by evaluating several state-of-the-art neural TTS models, including one that adapts to dialogue context, in a custom-built spoken dialogue system. We present system design, experiment setup, and results. Our work is the first to evaluate TTS in contextual dialogue system interactions. We also discuss the shortcomings and future opportunities of the proposed evaluation paradigm."},

To this end, we propose a novel method, DubWise: Multi-modal Large Language Model (LLM)-based Text-to-Speech (TTS), which can control the speech duration of synthesized speech in such a way that it aligns well with the speaker’s lip movements given in the reference video even when the spoken text is different or in a different language. To accomplish this, we propose to utilize cross-modal attention techniques in a pre-trained GPT-based TTS. We combine linguistic tokens from text, speaker identity tokens via a voice cloning network, and video tokens via a proposed duration controller network. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our system on the Lip2Wav-Chemistry and LRS2 datasets. Also, the proposed method achieves improved lip sync and naturalness compared to the SOTAs for the same language but different text (i.e., non-parallel) and the different language, different text (i.e., cross-lingual) scenarios."},

So far, most of the modeling of feedback responses has focused on their timing, often neglecting how their lexical and prosodic form influence their contextual appropriateness and conversational function. In this paper, we investigate the possibility of embedding short dialogue contexts and feedback responses in the same representation space using a contrastive learning objective. In our evaluation, we primarily focus on how such embeddings can be used as a context-feedback appropriateness metric and thus for feedback response ranking in U.S. English dialogues. Our results show that the model outperforms humans given the same ranking task and that the learned embeddings carry information about the conversational function of feedback responses."},

We find that ConvoCache can apply a UniEval coherence threshold of 90% and respond to 89% of prompts using the cache with an average latency of 214ms, replacing LLM and voice synthesis that can take over 1s. To further reduce latency we test prefetching and find limited usefulness. Prefetching with 80% of a request leads to a 63% hit rate, and a drop in overall coherence. ConvoCache can be used with any chatbot to reduce costs by reducing usage of generative AI by up to 89%."},

This methodology, which solely relies on genuine audio-visual data while negating the need for forged counterparts, is thus delineated as a ‘zero-shot’ detection paradigm. This paper introduces a novel zero-shot detection approach anchored in content consistency across audio and video. By employing pre-trained ASR and VSR models, we recognize the audio and video content sequences, respectively. Then, the edit distance between the two sequences is computed to assess whether the claimed video is genuine. Experimental results indicate that, compared to two mainstream approaches based on semantic consistency and temporal consistency, our approach achieves superior generalizability across various deepfake techniques and demonstrates strong robustness against audio-visual perturbations. Finally, state-of the-art performance gains can be achieved by simply integratingthe decision scores of these three systems."},

In this paper, we examine the assumptions and architectures used in previous works and show experimentally how shallow skipgram-like algorithms fail to encode distributional semantics when the input units are acoustically correlated. We illustrate the potential of an alternative deep end-to-end variant of the model and examine the effects on the resulting  embeddings, showing positive results of semantic relatedness in the embedding space."},

To leverage the diverse acoustic and linguistic features embedded in spontaneous speech, both the Whisper speech model and textual large language models (LLMs) are used for suicide risk detection.

In this paper, we propose a novel framework for performing WTE without the need for any HMM or phonetic labels. Specifically, the proposed method trains an alignment network using the outputs of the E2E ASR encoder and a voice activity detection module to generate the frame-level subword labels. In our experiments, the proposed method outperforms previous HMM-free WTE methods in a multilingual scenario. Notably, in the Fleurs dataset, we obtain a relative improvement of 57% over previous work in terms of accumulated averaging shift across 5 languages."},

Since the common scenario is where the language is already known, these models can perform as language-specific by using language information as prompts, which is particularly beneficial for attention-based encoder-decoder architectures. However, the Connectionist Temporal Classification (CTC) approach, which enhances recognition via joint decoding and multi-task training, does not normally incorporate language prompts due to its conditionally independent output tokens. To overcome this, we introduce an encoder prompting technique within the self-conditioned CTC framework, enabling language-specific adaptation of the CTC model in a zero-shot manner. Our method has shown to significantly reduce errors by 28% on average and by 41% on low-resource languages."},

To solve the problem, we incorporate a kind of state-space model, Hungry Hungry Hippos (H3), to replace or complement the multi-head self-attention (MHSA). H3 allows for efficient modeling of long-form sequences with a linear-order computation. In experiments using two datasets of CSJ and LibriSpeech, our proposed H3-Conformer model performs efficient and robust recognition of long-form speech. Moreover, we propose a hybrid of H3 and MHSA and show that using H3 in higher layers and MHSA in lower layers provides significant improvement in online recognition. We also investigate a parallel use of H3 and MHSA in all layers, resulting in the best performance."},

To address this issue, we propose the online subloop search (OSS) method, which implicitly adjusts the number of iterations based on the test sample and domain characteristics. The proposed method operates within a framework comprising a chaser model updated via stochastic gradient descent and a leader model updated through the exponential moving average. The OSS method quantifies and quantizes the uncertainty in the chaser model relative to the leader model, using the quantized value to predict the number of iterations for the subloop."},

In this paper, we propose the Personality-memory Gated Adaptation (PGA) approach to adapt models on target speakers while preserving generalized recognition performance. Specifically, we incorporate parallel adapters into the encoder to capture the target speaker’s vocal characteristics. The hidden outputs of the adapters and original encoder layers are fused via a scalar gate, which is derived from the similarity between input samples and personality memory units, i.e., personality embeddings from the target speaker. In this manner, the vocal characteristics of the target speaker are memorized by adapters while the ASR backbone preserves generalization. Experimental results show that, compared to the unadapted ASR backbone, the proposed PGA achieves 21.62% relative character error rate (CER) reduction on the target domain but a negligible CER increase on the source domain with limited adaptation data and training steps."},

In this work, we propose to enhance the hierarchical generation capability in HMTL by designing a recursive structure that iteratively uses the same model layers to refine intermediate predictions. These improved predictions are used to explicitly condition the deeper model layers, thereby facilitating more accurate predictions at the higher level. Experimental results show that HR-CTC outperforms conventional HMTL models across various ASR tasks, providing an additional benefit of balancing accuracy and inference speed."},

As the feature extraction (FE) module has also been well-trained with a large amount of training data, freezing the FE during finetuning for downstream ASR tasks is common. When there is a severe mismatch between the simulated noisy data for pretraining and real noisy data, however, finetuning the FE with the real noisy data should be done without losing the effective information of the pretrained FE. In this paper, we propose a dual-path adaptation of the FE to address this problem. It combines the frozen pretrained FE path and the finetuned-adapted FE path with convolutional fusion layers. Moreover, adapters are inserted into the Transformer encoder. The experimental results using the CHiME–4 dataset show that using adapters for the FE or the Transformer encoder is effective, but achieving synergy of these two is challenging. Finetuning of the FE combined with adapters in the encoder realizes effective model adaptation.

For settings where this is not practical, we investigate the benefit of performing noisy student teacher training on recordings in the test set as a test-time adaptation approach. Similarly to the dynamic evaluation approach in language modelling, this enables the transfer of information across utterance boundaries and functions as a method of domain adaptation.

Once the sparse mask stabilizes, our method allows transitioning to a dense model or keeping a sparse model by updating non-zero values. MSRS achieves competitive results in VSR and AVSR with 21.1% and 0.9% WER on the LRS3 benchmark, while reducing training time by at least 2x.

We formally analyze the effect of transfer between 3 English accents (word accuracy increase of 12%-17% absolute for transferred words) and how it scales with the number of annotated unique word types in the target accent. When annotating as few as 1k word types for the target accent, the transfer achieves a word accuracy of 81% for transferred words, approaching the generalisation ability of a baseline annotating 51k word types."},
{"title": "G2PA: G2P with Aligned Audio for Mandarin Chinese", "authors": "Xingxing Yang", "abstract": "During the training of a Mandarin Chinese Text-To-Speech (TTS) system, it is necessary to preprocess the training speech data, which mainly consists of audio and text pairs. One crucial preprocessing step involves converting Chinese graphemes to phonemes (G2P) to obtain phoneme representations when using phonemes as input. However, relying solely on the text for G2P conversion may lead to inaccurate results due to the pronunciation ambiguity of polyphones - characters with multiple pronunciations. Although previous research has attempted to address this issue, most approaches solely rely on text-based methods, disregarding the valuable audio information that can only be captured from the raw audio. To overcome this limitation, we  propose a G2P pipeline that leverages both audio and text inputs to resolve pronunciation ambiguity. The code and model weights for our approach are publicly available at the following GitHub repository: https://github.com/iooops/G2PA."},

For creating a TTS dataset that consists of label-speech paired data, the proposed annotation model leverages an automatic speech recognition (ASR) model to obtain phonemic and prosodic labels from unlabeled speech samples. By fine-tuning a large-scale pretrained ASR model, we can construct the annotation model using a limited amount of label-speech paired data within an existing TTS dataset. To alleviate the shortage of label-speech paired data for training the annotation model, we generate pseudo label-speech paired data using text-only corpora and an auxiliary TTS model. This TTS model is also trained with the existing TTS dataset. Experimental results show that the TTS model trained with the dataset created by the proposed annotation method can synthesize speech as naturally as the one trained with a fully-labeled dataset."},

Conventional transformer-based methods encounter limitations in referencing specific dictionary readings due to the inability of the model to directly modify its intermediate processes and weights. Therefore, this study employs a dual Transformer strategy to improve the accurate pronunciation of proper nouns, numerals, and counter words. The first Transformer method facilitates the application of external data, and the second Transformer employs BERT to predict accent sandhi. This combination of Transformer-based techniques with dictionary integration enables the accurate and arbitrary pronunciation of proper nouns, numerals, and counter words, which contribute to the ongoing development of text-to-speech technologies."},

However, during the conversion process, the issue of timbre leakage is inevitable: the converted singing voice still sounds like the original singer's voice. To tackle this, we propose a latent diffusion model for SVC (LDM-SVC)  in this work, which attempts to perform SVC in the latent space using an LDM. We pretrain a variational autoencoder structure using the noted open-source So-VITS-SVC project based on the VITS framework, which is then used for the LDM training. Besides, we propose a singer guidance training method based on  classifier-free guidance to further suppress the timbre of the original singer. Experimental results show the superiority of  the proposed method over previous works in both subjective and objective evaluations of timbre similarity."},

In this paper, we showcase the advantages of tokenization of  phonetic units and of DAUs on three prediction tasks: grapheme-to-phoneme, grapheme-to-DAUs, and unsupervised speech generation using DAU language modeling. We demonstrate that tokenization yields significant improvements  in terms of performance, as well as training and inference speed, across all three tasks. We also offer theoretical insights to provide some explanation for the superior performance observed."},

Traditional Hebrew contains Diacritics, which dictate the way individuals should pronounce given words, however, modern Hebrew rarely uses them. The lack of diacritics in modern Hebrew results in readers expected to conclude the correct pronunciation and understand which phonemes to use based on the context. This imposes a fundamental challenge on TTS systems to accurately map between text-to-speech. In this work, we propose to adopt a language modeling Diacritics-Free approach, for the task of Hebrew TTS. The model operates on discrete speech representations and is conditioned on a word-piece tokenizer. We optimize the proposed method using in-the-wild weakly supervised data and compare it to several diacritic-based TTS systems. Results suggest the proposed method is superior to the evaluated baselines considering both content preservation and naturalness of the generated speech.

Based on this observation, we propose a method to split and disentangle speaker representation into complementary embeddings conveying respectively prosodic and timbre information. Additionally, we propose a method to evaluate prosody preservation in standard voice privacy architectures and we validate the power of prosodic and timbre embeddings to detect related voice attributes."},

However, there are still two critical challenges in this field. Firstly, current voice conversion methods have limited robustness when encountering unseen speakers. Secondly, they also have limited ability to control timbre representation. To address these challenges, this paper presents a novel approach that leverages tokens of multi-layer residual approximations to enhance robustness when dealing with unseen speakers, called the residual speaker module. Introducing multi-layer approximations facilitates the separation of information from the timbre, enabling effective control over timbre in voice conversion. The proposed method outperforms baselines in subjective and objective evaluations, demonstrating superior performance and increased robustness. Our demo page is publicly available."},

The VC-T, a streaming VC based on neural transducer, ensures monotonic alignments, outperforming seq2seq VC. However, VC-T demands guiding alignments and time-consuming training due to tensor computations. The guiding alignments are generated from manually annotated phoneme labels with labor-intensive efforts, and they are essential for eliminating improbable paths, thus stabilizing VC-T training. This work proposes a two-stage VC-T training pipeline for fast convergence: 1) VC-T pre-training to learn probable paths, which form a matrix, optimized by L1 loss, 2) Fine-tuning refines the pre-trained VC-T, outputting a probable tensor from the start. This enables VC-T training without the guiding alignment. Experiments show our pipeline achieves superior streaming VC while significantly reducing training time compared to conventional VC-T."},

Conventional denoising training improves the noise robustness of a VC model by learning noisy-to-clean VC process. However, the naturalness of the converted speech is limited when the noise of the source speech is unseen during the training. To this end, our proposed training conditions a VC model on two latent variables representing the recording quality and environment of the source speech. These latent variables are derived from deep neural networks pre-trained on recording quality assessment and acoustic scene classification and calculated in an utterance-wise or frame-wise manner. As a result, the trained VC model can explicitly learn information about speech degradation during the training. Objective and subjective evaluations show that our training improves the quality of the converted speech compared to the conventional training."},

When conveying this information, it is crucial to ensure that the source speaker's information is not transmitted. So we adopt auxiliary learning with cluster-based pseudo labels. It helps the content encoder to focus on content information while excluding speaker information by performing a pseudo label classification task using its output. We conduct comparative experiments between various baseline models and the proposed model using subjective and objective metrics.

It bridges domain gaps by integrating it seamlessly with state-of-the-art transformer models and/or with other fine-tuning methods, boosting their performance on target data (challenge (i)). In addition, our method can fit small target datasets because it does not require a large number of extra parameters (challenge (ii)). This feature also contributes to computational efficiency, countering the high computational costs typically associated with large-scale pre-trained models in ADD (challenge (iii)). We conclude that prompt tuning for ADD under domain gaps presents a promising avenue for enhancing accuracy with minimal target data and negligible extra computational burden."},

Müller, Nicholas Evans, Hemlata Tak, Philip Sperl, Konstantin Böttinger", "abstract": "Recent research has highlighted a key issue in speech deepfake detection: models trained on one set of deepfakes perform poorly on others. The question arises: is this due to the continuously improving quality of text-to-speech (TTS) models, i.e., are newer DeepFakes just ‘harder’ to detect? Or, is it because deepfakes generated with one model are fundamentally different to those generated using another model? We answer this question by decomposing the performance gap between in-domain and out-of-domain test data into ‘hardness’ and ‘difference’ components. Experiments performed using ASVspoof databases indicate that the hardness component is practically negligible, with the performance gap being attributed primarily to the difference component. This has direct implications for real-world deepfake detection, highlighting that merely increasing model capacity, the currently-dominant research trend, may not effectively address the generalization challenge."},

Therefore, predictions learned through MSE have limited correlations. This paper introduces a novel approach that leverages the relative quality distinctions among speech samples. By enforcing relative ranking using Pairwise and Triplet Ranking Losses, our method encourages the SQA model to learn not only the absolute quality of individual speech samples but also their quality in comparison to others, addressing the limitations of MSE-based approaches. Additionally, we suggest pretraining the SQA encoder with an ASR task to enhance generalization. Experiments on NISQA test sets confirm our approach's effectiveness."},

Forced-choice tests such as AB or Best Worst Scaling (BWS) can in principle mitigate some of these issues. Our aim here is to compare MOS, AB and BWS tests in 3 regards: 1) Which test type do listeners prefer in terms of ease, engagement and overall likeability? 2) How fast are listeners at each test type? 3) Does each test type provide the same pattern of results? To answer these questions we re-use a subset of stimuli from the Blizzard Challenge 2013 and conduct new MOS, AB and BWS tests. Overall, we conclude each test type is broadly equally valid, MOS may not in fact be the fastest or easiest test type for listeners, but the theoretical advantages of BWS are counterbalanced by it seeming less liked by our listeners here."},

Schuller", "abstract": "Foundation models have shown great promise in speech emotion recognition (SER) by leveraging their pre-trained representations to capture emotion patterns in speech signals. To further enhance SER performance across various languages and domains, we propose a novel twofold approach. First, we gather EmoSet++, a comprehensive multi-lingual, multi-cultural speech emotion corpus with 37 datasets, 150,907 samples, and a total duration of 119.5 hours. Second, we introduce ExHuBERT, an enhanced version of HuBERT achieved by backbone extension and fine-tuning on EmoSet++. We duplicate each encoder layer and its weights, then freeze the first duplicate, integrating an extra zero-initialized linear layer and skip connections to preserve functionality and ensure its adaptability for subsequent fine-tuning. Our evaluation on unseen datasets shows the efficacy of ExHuBERT, setting a new benchmark for various SER tasks. Model and details on EmoSet++: https://huggingface.co/amiriparian/ExHuBERT."},
{"title": "Magnitude and timing of acceleration peaks in stressed and unstressed syllables", "authors": "Malin Svensson Lundmark", "abstract": "Segment transitions can be accounted for by acceleration peaks, which appear at the edges of articulatory speech postures. The present study builds on previous research on timing of acceleration, and expands it by investigating magnitude of acceleration peaks at segment offset, comparing stressed and unstressed syllables. Acceleration peaks of lower lip and lower jaw are measured on ten Swedish speakers using EMA methodology. Results show strong correlation between acceleration and velocity peak magnitude, with overall more magnitude in stressed syllables, and highest acceleration peaks on lower lip. However, timing of the acceleration peaks, as measured from minimal velocity, is not affected by how fast the articulators are moving. The results reveal possible different functions of acceleration peak magnitude vs timing, also between the two articulators. The study stresses the significance of mapping acceleration peaks in speech for use in prosodic research."},

The proposed model utilizes WaveNet to sequentially reconstruct the envelope, 10-band Mel, 80-band Mel, and magnitude at progressively finer granularity levels. A cross-attention mechanism is introduced to explore correlations across modalities to address the modality gap. A combined loss function and Mixup augmentation technique are also employed to enhance the reconstruction performance. Notably, our approach achieves Pearson correlation values of 0.0651 ± 0.0153 for the validation set and 0.0413 ± 0.0169 for the heldout-subjects test set, securing the second position in the 2024 Auditory EEG Challenge.

The design is implemented as a cooperative game, in which listeners are presented with a sequence of sounds that range on a continuum between two endpoints unambiguously associated with two phoneme categories in a joint phoneme identification task. To play the game successfully, listeners must comply with both a distinctivity constraint (identify the endpoints as being different from each other) and an agreement constraint (identify the stimuli in the same way as their partner). Our first results show that our experimental design opens new avenues for research on convergence between listeners in speech perception."},

This trend is amplified by AI-powered personal assistants’ proliferation, multiplying our interactions with intelligent systems. Research is crucial to understand if phenomena observed in human-human interactions can inform these new interactions. For instance, in everyday conversation, people adjust their speaking rate to match their partner's, a phenomenon known as speech rate convergence. It is crucial for effective communication, occurs automatically and is present in more artificial interaction scenarios. We investigated how the nature (natural vs. artificial) and the presentation rate (normal vs. fast) of the speech signal impact speech rate convergence. Data from 116 participants across two experiments reveal higher convergence towards naturally produced speech compared to artificially time altered speech. Implications for human-machine interactions are discussed."},

To validate this hypothesis, we conducted a EEG study comparing the auditory responses of language-specific cortical regions to speech streams containing novel tri-syllable words and random syllable sequences. Distinctive time-frequency patterns were detected with a lexical learning effect, especially in the primary auditory cortex of the left hemisphere. Besides, the middle temporal gyrus was found to be instrumental in the initial segmenting of speech streams, while the anterior temporal lobe was more prominent in orchestrating the top-down prediction based on established word structures. These findings reinforce the assertion that humans perceive and segment words by internalizing rule-based combinations in a predictive and statistical manner."},

Ideal audio tokens must preserve content, paralinguistic elements, speaker identity, and many other audio details. Current audio tokenization methods fall into two categories: Semantic tokens, acquired through quantization of Self-Supervised Learning (SSL) models, and Neural compression-based tokens (codecs). Although previous studies have benchmarked codec models to identify optimal configurations, the ideal setup for quantizing pretrained SSL models remains unclear. This paper explores the optimal configuration of semantic tokens across discriminative and generative tasks. We propose a scalable solution to train a universal vocoder across multiple SSL layers.

Gales", "abstract": "Foundation ASR models often support many languages, e.g. 100 languages in Whisper. However, there has been limited work on integrating an additional, typically low-resource, language, while maintaining performance on the original language set. Fine-tuning, while simple, may degrade the accuracy on the original set. We compare three approaches that exploit adaptation parameters: soft language code tuning, train only the language code; soft prompt tuning, train prepended tokens; and LoRA where a small set of additional parameters are optimised. Elastic Weight Consolidation (EWC) offers an alternative compromise with the potential to maintain performance in specific target languages. Results show that direct fine-tuning yields the best performance for the new language but degrades existing language capabilities. EWC can address this issue for specific languages. If only adaptation parameters are used, the language capabilities are maintained but at the cost of performance in the new language."},

The extended fine-tuning starts from an already fine-tuned ASR model and augments it with new output units for the unique Sámi characters before new fine-tuning with transcribed Sámi data. Our results demonstrate the benefits of these advanced adaptation techniques, as both approaches lead to better performance than the direct fine-tuning-based adaptation."},

To this end, we extend the general framework for SSL model utilization by proposing the interface that connects the upstream and downstream. Under this view, the dominant technique of combining features via a layerwise weighted sum can be regarded as a specific interface. We propose several alternative interface designs and demonstrate that the weighted sum interface is suboptimal for many tasks.

The current study designed a robot-assisted training with controlled social interactions aiming to enhance the prosody of children with Autism speaking a tonal language, Cantonese, specifically on focus marking. 20 autistic and 23 typically-developing (TD) children participated in this study. Only the autistic group received training. Stimuli were designed for training, pre- and post-training production. Acoustics of target words were extracted and analysed using linear mixed-effects models examining effects of training and clinical status. Children with Autism improved in signalling sentence prominence using duration but not f0 and intensity. Variability suggests that certain acoustic cues are more challenging. Comparing to TD children's focus marking patterns, autistic children's variability may also stem from their ongoing prosodic profile development."},

However, to demonstrate clinical utility at tracking longitudinal progress of the disease, one needs to understand how well these biomarkers capture changes that are ‘clinically meaningful’, a concept that is not always clearly defined. Therefore, this paper defines and explores multiple methods of computing minimal clinically important difference (MCID) using ratings of speech impairment severity and listener effort as clinical anchors. We analyze how these methods impact the estimated responsiveness of various metrics collected from 125 ALS patients via a multimodal dialog based remote assessment platform. We find that select biomarkers are more responsive than the clinical standard ALSFRS-R across the board at tracking clinically meaningful changes related to speech severity. We further discuss advantages and disadvantages of different MCID computation methods for assessing ALS disease progression."},

However, their development is often hampered by data scarcity. Federated Learning (FL) is a potential solution that could enable entities with limited voice recordings to collectively build effective models. Motivated by this, we compare centralised, local, and federated learning for building speech-based models to discern Alzheimer’s Disease, Mild Cognitive Impairment, and a healthy state. For a more realistic evaluation, we use three independently collected datasets to simulate healthcare institutions employing these strategies. Our initial analysis shows that FL may not be the best solution in every scenario, as performance improvements are not guaranteed even with small amounts of available data, and further research is needed to determine the conditions under which it is beneficial."},

Federated learning (FL), a privacy-preserving algorithm, is a solution. However, FL ASR suffers from acoustic and text heterogeneities. While advanced model-based and cluster-based FL methods aim to address the issue, they lack a direct mechanism for high intra-speaker heterogeneity exhibited by AD individuals and ASR-related properties. This study presents cluster-based personalized federated learning (CPFL), a strategy mitigating heterogeneity by clustering ASR output token using the proposed CharDiv, a metric for pause and word usage distributions. Evaluation on the ADReSS challenge dataset shows a 3.6% improvement in word error rate (WER). Analysis of per-cluster WER improvements and CharDiv distributions indicates reduced heterogeneity, emphasizing pause usage as a potential key factor in AD-oriented ASR."},

Detecting and diagnosing a medical condition takes time and is usually expensive in terms of labor. However, early identification and treatment are essential for subsequent care. ASR-based child speech assessment prioritizes semantic understanding over phonetic accuracy, making it unsuitable for pronunciation assessment. This study uses phonemic transcription available in a normative dataset and utilizes pre-trained speech models to develop an automatic phoneme recognition model with a Phoneme Error Rate (PER) as low as 3.76%. Clinically relevant indices calculated from the model prediction are highly correlated with those from the original normative data. We regard these experimental results as solid evidence that validates the feasibility of our evaluation workflow for practical application in early screening for phonological development delays."},

Our method enables an ASR model like Whisper to interpret lip movements in a video and output text transcriptions. We achieve this by learning a cross-modal mapping from a lip sequence to a speech sequence, allowing a pre-trained ASR model to directly perform lip-reading. The mapping can be learnt simply by backpropagating the cross-entropy loss on the text labels through the pre-trained, frozen ASR model. We achieve an impressive gain of 5.7 WER in the low data regime on the LRS3 benchmark over previous lip-reading methods. Finally, we demonstrate that the same strategy can be extended to other visual speech tasks, such as identifying the spoken language in silent videos."},

Since videos are harder to obtain than audio, the video training data of AVSR models is usually limited to a few thousand hours. In contrast, speech models such as Whisper are trained with hundreds of thousands of hours of data, and thus learn a better speech-to-text decoder. The huge training data difference motivates us to adapt Whisper to handle video inputs. Inspired by Flamingo which injects visual features into language models, we propose Whisper-Flamingo which integrates visual features into the Whisper speech recognition and translation model with gated cross attention. Our audio-visual Whisper-Flamingo outperforms audio-only Whisper on English speech recognition and En-X translation for 6 languages in noisy conditions. Moreover, Whisper-Flamingo is a versatile model and conducts all of these tasks using one set of parameters, while prior methods are trained separately on each language."},

In HuBERT-EE, multiple early exit branches are added at the intermediate layers. When the intermediate prediction of the early exit branch is confident, the model stops the inference, and the corresponding result can be returned early.

Diagnostic classifiers of the CNN output reveal vowel-specific stress representations, that perform on par with acoustic features.  Stress classifiers trained on transformer layers outperform classifiers based on acoustic correlates, but degrade when context is removed, showing that higher layers take the relative nature of stress into account. Results obtained by testing a stress classifier on a vowel it is not trained on, show that stress processing is to some extent abstract, i.e., the classifier does not simply detect a set of stressed vowel representations but rather, their common denominator."},

However, manual prosody annotation is labor-intensive and inconsistent. To address this issue, a two-stage automatic annotation pipeline is novelly proposed in this paper. In the first stage, we use contrastive pretraining of Speech-Silence and Word-Punctuation (SSWP) pairs to enhance prosodic information in latent representations. In the second stage, we build a multi-modal prosody annotator, comprising pretrained encoders, a text-speech fusing scheme, and a sequence classifier. Experiments on English prosodic boundaries demonstrate that our method achieves state-of-the-art (SOTA) performance with 0.72 and 0.93 f1 score for Prosodic Word and Prosodic Phrase boundary respectively, while bearing remarkable robustness to data scarcity."},
{"title": "A Human-in-the-Loop Approach to Improving Cross-Text Prosody Transfer", "authors": "Himanshu Maurya, Atli Sigurgeirsson", "abstract": "Text-To-Speech (TTS) prosody transfer models can generate varied prosodic renditions, for the same text, by conditioning on a reference utterance. These models are trained with a reference that is identical to the target utterance. But when the reference utterance differs from the target text, as in cross-text prosody transfer, these models struggle to separate prosody from text, resulting in reduced perceived naturalness. To address this, we propose a Human-in-the-Loop (HitL) approach. HitL users adjust salient correlates of prosody to make the prosody more appropriate for the target text, while maintaining the overall reference prosodic effect. Human adjusted renditions maintain the reference prosody while being rated as more appropriate for the target text 57.8% of the time. Our analysis suggests that limited user effort suffices for these improvements, and that closeness in the latent reference space is not a reliable prosodic similarity metric for the cross-text condition."},

However, current efforts focus on timbre generalization rather than prosody modeling, which results in limited naturalness and expressiveness. To address this, we introduce a novel speech synthesis model trained on large-scale datasets, including both timbre and hierarchical prosody modeling. As timbre is a global attribute closely linked to expressiveness, we adopt a global vector to model speaker timbre while guiding prosody modeling. Besides, given that prosody contains both global consistency and local variations, we introduce a diffusion model as the pitch predictor and employ a prosody adaptor to model prosody hierarchically, further enhancing the prosody quality of the synthesized speech. Experimental results show that our model not only maintains comparable timbre quality to the baseline but also exhibits better naturalness and expressiveness.

We propose a method of encoding prosodic knowledge from textual and acoustic modalities, which are obtained with the help of models pretrained on self-supervised tasks, into latent quantized space with interpretable features. Based on these features, the prosodic markup is constructed, and it is used as an additional input to the TTS model to solve the one-to-many problem and is predicted by text.

Leading non-autoregressive (NAR) TTS models treat duration modelling as a regression problem. The same utterance is then spoken with identical timings every time, unlike when a human speaks. Probabilistic models of duration have been proposed, but there is mixed evidence of their benefits. However, prior studies generally only consider speech read aloud, and ignore spontaneous speech, despite the latter being both a more common and a more variable mode of speaking. We compare the effect of conventional deterministic duration modelling to durations sampled from a powerful probabilistic model based on conditional flow matching (OT-CFM), in three different NAR TTS approaches: regression-based, deep generative, and end-to-end. Across four different corpora, stochastic duration modelling improves probabilistic NAR TTS approaches, especially for spontaneous speech."},

Privacy-preserving speech processing seeks to filter out any private information that is not needed for downstream tasks, for example with an information bottleneck, sufficiently tight that only the desired information can pass through. We however demonstrate that the occurrence frequency of codebook elements in bottlenecks using vector quantization have an uneven information rate, threatening privacy. We thus propose to use space-filling vector quantization (SFVQ) together with occurrence normalization, balancing the information rate and thus protecting privacy. Our experiments with speaker identification validate the proposed method. This approach thus provides a generic tool for quantizing information bottlenecks in any speech applications such that their privacy disclosure is predictable and quantifiable."},

Currently, the prevailing assumption is that unaltered human speech can always be considered genuine, while fake speech usually comes from text-to-speech (TTS) synthesis. We argue that this type of binary distinction is oversimplified. For instance, altered playback speeds can maliciously deceive listeners, as in the `Drunken Nancy Pelosi' incident. Similarly, editing of audio clips can be done ethically, e.g. for brevity or summarization in news reporting or podcasts, but editing can also create misleading narratives. In this paper, we propose a conceptual shift away from the longstanding binary paradigm of speech audio being either `fake' or `real'. Instead, we focus on pinpointing `voice edits', which encompass traditional modifications like filters and cuts, as well as neural synthesis. We delineate six categories of voice edits and curate a new challenge dataset, for which we present baseline voice edit detection systems."},

The speech enhancement performance varies depending on the choice of the stochastic differential equation that controls the evolution of the mean and the variance along the diffusion processes when adding environmental and Gaussian noise. In this work, we highlight that the scale of the variance is a dominant parameter for speech enhancement performance and show that it controls the tradeoff between noise attenuation and speech distortions. More concretely, we show that a larger variance increases the noise attenuation and allows for reducing the computational footprint, as fewer function evaluations for generating the estimate are required."},

Most researchers directly replaced handcrafted features with the universal representations of the PTMs, and jointly fine-tuned PTMs with the downstream SV networks, which undoubtedly discarded important spectral information contained in handcrafted features and also increased the training cost. In this paper, we proposed an efficient feature integration method that utilized a Fine-grained Fusion Module to fuse the multi-layer representations of the PTMs adaptively. Then we integrated the fused representations with handcrafted features to obtain the integrated features, which were subsequently fed into the SV network. The experimental results demonstrated that using the integrated features effectively enhanced the performance of the SV systems, and yielded decent results with no need to fine-tune the PTMs. Moreover, employing full-parameter fine-tuning led to the current optimal results."},

Our framework utilises an auto-encoder as a disentangler, dividing the input speaker embedding into components related to the speaker and other residual information. We employ a group of objective functions to ensure that the auto-encoder's code representation - used as the refined embedding - condenses only the speaker characteristics. We show the versatility of our framework through its compatibility with any existing speaker embedding extractor, requiring no structural modifications or adaptations for integration. We validate the effectiveness of our framework by incorporating it into two popularly used embedding extractors and conducting experiments across various benchmarks. The results show a performance improvement of up to 16%. We release our code for this work to be available here."},

To overcome this obstacle, we propose a novel structure, MR-RawNet, designed to enhance the robustness of speaker verification systems against variable duration utterances using raw waveforms. The MR-RawNet extracts time-frequency representations from raw waveforms via a multi-resolution feature extractor that optimally adjusts both temporal and spectral resolutions simultaneously. Furthermore, we apply a multi-resolution attention block that focuses on diverse and extensive temporal contexts, ensuring robustness against changes in utterance length. The experimental results, conducted on VoxCeleb1 dataset, demonstrate that the MR-RawNet exhibits superior performance in handling utterances of variable duration compared to other raw waveform-based systems."},

The SC module expands the model’s receptive field and improves spatial attention for better capture of contextual information. The SimAM attention mechanism assigns unique weights to individual neurons, so it can place greater emphasis on more informative ones. The MDTY-based front-end module adapts itself to diverse temporal speech features with adaptive convolutional kernels, and aggregates these kernels to capture temporal variations with attention weights. Our proposed model, IM ECAPA MTDY-TDNN SimAM, demonstrates improved performance and complexity trade-offs compared to recent research works.

For the front-end, we propose an attention-based fusion module (AFM) to merge deep and shallow layers of the PTM features. To enhance the performance, we add an auxiliary speaker loss after the last layer of the PTM. For the DBE back-end, each branch of DBE takes aggregated features from PTM and FBank features as input. The AFM is further used to merge the dual-branch features to provide complementary information. Experimental results on VoxCeleb datasets confirm the effectiveness of our proposed method across different PTMs."},

The Sinc-Extractor (SE) network, developed for PVAD, learns cutoff frequencies and band gains of sinc functions to extract acoustic features. Additionally, the speaker conditional SE (SCSE) module incorporates speaker information from high-dimensional d-vectors into low-dimensional acoustic features. SE-PVAD and Vanilla PVAD have similar model size and computing load, while SCSE-PVAD is more compact with shorter inference time as it excludes speaker embedding. Evaluated with concatenated utterances from the LibriSpeech corpus, SE-PVAD outperforms Vanilla PVAD significantly. SCSE-PVAD matches Vanilla PVAD's performance but reduces input feature dimensionality and network complexity. Thus, SCSE-PVAD can function like a typical VAD, accepting only acoustic features, making it suitable for low-resource wearable devices."},

{"title": "Speech Formants Integration for Generalized Detection of Synthetic Speech Spoofing Attacks", "authors": "Kexu Liu, Yuanxin Wang, Shengchen Li, Xi Shao", "abstract": "Existing synthetic speech detection systems struggle with high variance of performance in different spoofing attacks. This is due to the diversity of unseen synthesis algorithms, making it challenging for the system to generalize unseen spoofing attacks. To address this, we propose multi-view features with one-class learning for synthetic speech detection. The key idea is to capture bona-fide speech features from dynamic information of formants and XLS-R dimensions, aiming to compactly represent bona-fide speech in the embedding space without the need to fit various unseen spoofing attacks. To leverage multi-view features, the dynamic information of formants is integrated with XLS-R features using a parallel attention mechanism and gating modulation. Our system achieves an equal error rate (EER) of 0.39% in the ASVspoof 2019 logical access scenario, demonstrating a low performance variance of 0.069 across all 13 attacks, outperforming most mainstream single-systems."},

However, apart from the heavy computation overhead, fine-tuning of pre-trained model is prone to over-fitting and catastrophic forgetting due to limited training data. In this paper, we propose an novel adapter learning framework based on pre-trained model for robust spoof speech detection. We consider two adapter cases, i.e., intra-block adapters and cross-block adapters, which are inserted or appended to the backbone Wav2vec2. The parameters of the adapters are updated by freezing the backbone during training. The local-global task-dependent information for spoof speech detection is obtained via the proposed adapter learning with a marginal increase of parameters. Results on three benchmark datasets validate the superiority over the baseline and existing SOTA systems."},

In addition, the generalization capabilities of the system are improved by augmenting the training corpora using additional synthetic data from different vocoder algorithms. This strategy is also complemented by various data augmentations covering challenging acoustic conditions.

{"title": "Urdu Alternative Questions: A Hat Pattern", "authors": "Benazir Mumtaz, Miriam Butt", "abstract": "This study explores the prosody of alternative questions (AltQs) in Urdu. We found that AltQs are characterized by a hat pattern that is linked to double contrast sentences, featuring two contrastive foci, similar to German. However, unlike German, the selection of the phrasal accent (PA) is fixed. In Urdu the first PA features an L*(+H)Ha while the second accent has an L*(+H). The hat pattern's full realization depends on the spacing between PAs: greater spacing leads to a prolonged high peak, while reduced spacing results in a compressed hat pattern. Moreover, both the accentual phrase (AP) and the hat pattern carry an L*H contour, with differences in H tone realization: with the hat pattern, the H is significantly higher than that of the AP. We explain the presence of this shared phonological L*H contour by noting that the basic intonational phonology of Urdu is defined by a series of L*H contours, that can then be realized in different ways to show, for example, focus or AltQs."},

To investigate this question, we looked at the unstressed verbal prefix ge- diachronically and synchronically. A corpus study of three Old English, Old Saxon, and Old High German manuscripts showed that ge- often attaches to preceding auxiliaries and negation particles but not content words. The findings of the corpus study were verified through a production study in Modern German, measuring the closure duration of [g] as an indication of boundary strength between the prefix and the preceding word. Results showed that closure duration is reduced if the verb follows a monosyllabic auxiliary. Furthermore, we found no indicators that the prefix interacts with preceding content words or negation. Both results taken together support the trochaic foot structure based on rhythmic principles, but only in very restricted contexts."},

The analysis of the hour-long speech production data from 33 speakers indicates that both morphosyntax and semantics play a crucial role in shaping the intonation of wh-indeterminates. We found that wh-indeterminates in complex clause structures effectively utilize all prosodic features to convey interrogative meaning. Moreover, when a morphosyntactic marker suggests a preference for a specific interpretation of wh-indeterminates, there is a reduced prosodic contrast (although still significantly different) between wh-interrogatives and wh-indefinites, underlying an interference effect of morphosyntactic cues in speech production."},

As a discourse marker, “ma” displays the widest pitch range. As a deixis, “ma” shares similar acoustic characteristics with it as a pronoun but exhibits a more stable distribution of primary acoustic features.

Careful analysis reveals that ALST is capable of fine-grained, interpretable predictions of ALS progression."},
{"title": "When Whisper Listens to Aphasia: Advancing Robust Post-Stroke Speech Recognition", "authors": "Giulia Sanguedolce, Sophie Brook, Dragos C. Gruia, Patrick A. Naylor, Fatemeh Geranmayeh", "abstract": "Despite recent advancements in Automatic Speech Recognition (ASR), its accuracy remains low for pathological speech, thereby limiting AI-based healthcare interventions in such settings. This work addresses this challenge by fine-tuning Whisper, an ASR known for its ability to capture high-dimensional features in healthy speech. Using our comprehensive dataset of patients with stroke, we fine-tuned Whisper and significantly reduced Word Error Rate (WER), surpassing previous work on severe aphasia. To demonstrate its generalisability, we tested the model on a separate database, AphasiaBank, and observed a lower WER despite variations in dialect, linguistics, and test protocols. Our result on the AphasiaBank was superior to previous ASRs trained on this database, confirming the generalisability of our approach. These outcomes not only address ASR limitations in impaired speech but also establish the foundations for standardised and versatile AI solutions for remote speech monitoring for timely diagnosis and intervention."},

Current aphasia assessment does not consider natural speech due to the time consuming nature of manual transcriptions and a lack of knowledge on how to analyze such data. Here, we evaluate the potential of automatic speech recognition (ASR) to transcribe Dutch aphasic speech and the ability of natural speech features to detect aphasia. A picture-description task was administered and automatically transcribed in 62 persons with aphasia and 57 controls. Acoustic and linguistic features were semi-automatically extracted and provided as input to a support vector machine (SVM) classifier. Our ASR model obtained a WER of 24.5%, outperforming earlier ASR models for aphasia. The SVM shows high accuracy (86.6%) at the individual level, with fluency features as most dominant to detect aphasia. ASR and semi-automatic feature extraction can thus facilitate natural speech analysis in a time efficient manner in clinical practice."},

Starting from a textual baseline, we investigate the effect of incorporation of pause information and acoustic context. We show the test should be chosen depending on the task, and similarly, lexical pause information and acoustic cross-attention contribute differently."},

This fine granularity prediction enabled us to identify specific linguistic segments with high discrimination capability. Speech representations of all produced verbs were compared w.r.t. nouns and the first ones yielded higher accuracies. To gain a deeper understanding of this pattern, representations of motor and non-motor verbs were compared and the first ones yielded better results, with accuracies of around 83% in an independent test set. These findings support well-established neurocognitive models about action-related language highlighted as key drivers of PD."},

Using a dataset with paired speech-text data, the overall system is trained to generate consistent responses to prompts with the same semantic information regardless of the input modality. The resulting framework allows the LLM to process speech inputs in the same way as text, enabling speech summarization by simply prompting the LLM.

In this paper, we propose an end-to-end SSum model that utilizes Q-Former as a connector for the audio-text modality and employs LLMs to generate text summaries directly from speech features. We adopt a multi-stage training approach that includes LLM based ASR and Text Summarization (TSum) tasks as auxiliary tasks.

To explore this approach, we present two datasets for Sen-SSum: Mega-SSum and CSJ-SSum. Using these datasets, our study evaluates two types of Transformer-based models: 1) cascade models that combine ASR and strong text summarization models, and 2) end-to-end (E2E) models that directly convert speech into a text summary. While E2E models are appealing to develop compute-efficient models, they perform worse than cascade models. Therefore, we propose knowledge distillation for E2E models using pseudo-summaries generated by the cascade models. Our experiments show that this proposed knowledge distillation effectively improves the performance of the E2E model on both datasets."},

In response, smaller-scale LLMs (sLLMs) of easy accessibility and low costs have been extensively studied, yet they often suffer from missing key information and entities, i.e., low relevance, in particular, when input documents are long. We hence propose a key-element-informed instruction tuning for summarization, so-called KEITSum, which identifies key elements in documents and instructs sLLM to generate summaries capturing these key elements. Experimental results on dialogue and news datasets demonstrate that sLLM with KEITSum indeed provides high-quality summarization with higher relevance and less hallucinations, competitive to proprietary LLM."},

Specifically, we instruct an LLM to predict the transcription from the N-best hypotheses generated using ASR beam-search. This is further conditioned on lip motions. This approach addresses key challenges in traditional AVSR learning, such as the lack of large-scale paired datasets and difficulties in adapting to new domains.

This is the first “decoder-only” ASR architecture designed to handle continuous audio without explicit end-pointing. Speech ReaLLM is a special case of the more general ReaLLM (“real-time LLM”) approach, also introduced here for the first time. The idea is inspired by RNN-T: Instead of generating a response only at the end of a user prompt, generate after every input token received in real time (it is often empty). On Librispeech “test,” an 80M Speech ReaLLM achieves WERs of 3.0% and 7.4% in real time (without an external LM or auxiliary loss). This is only slightly above a 3x larger Attention-Encoder-Decoder baseline.

In addition, frame-wise approximation as an acceleration method cannot generalise well to test time conditions where the LP is computed sample-wise. Efficient differentiable sample-wise LP for end-to-end training is the key to removing this barrier. We generalise the efficient time-invariant LP implementation from the GOLF vocoder to time-varying cases. Combining this with the classic source-filter model, we show that the improved GOLF learns LP coefficients and reconstructs the voice better than its frame-wise counterparts. Moreover, in our listening test, synthesised outputs from GOLF scored higher in quality ratings than the state-of-the-art differentiable WORLD vocoder."},

Our ablation studies reveal that just 1 hour of neutral and 30 minutes of expressive data can yield a Fair system as indicated by MUSHRA scores. Increasing neutral data to 10 hours, with minimal expressive data, significantly enhances expressiveness.

To this end, we first asked 100 crowdworkers to record their voice samples using smartphones. Then, we annotated the recorded samples with speaker-wise recording-quality scores and utterance-wise perceived emotion labels. We also benchmark SRC4VC on any-to-any VC, in which we trained a multi-speaker VC model on high-quality speech and used the SRC4VC speakers' voice samples as the source in VC. The results show that the recording quality mismatch between the training and evaluation data significantly degrades the VC performance, which can be improved by applying speech enhancement to the low-quality source speech samples."},

We build emotion vectors by subtracting the weights of a pre-trained model from the weights of the same model after fine-tuning for a given emotion. These emotion vectors can be modified or combined through arithmetic operations such as negation and addition, with the hope of steering the behaviour of the resulting model accordingly in the generation of emotional speech.

They leverage a strong in-context ability to mimic the speech prompts, including speaker style, prosody, and emotion. Therefore, the selection of a speech prompt greatly influences the generated speech, akin to the importance of a prompt in large language models (LLMs). However, current prompt-based TTS models choose the speech prompt manually or simply at random. Hence, in this paper, we adapt retrieval augmented generation (RAG) from LLMs to prompt-based TTS. Unlike traditional RAG methods, we additionally consider contextual information during the retrieval process and present a Context-Aware Contrastive Language-Audio Pre-training (CA-CLAP) model to extract context-aware, style-related features. The objective and subjective evaluations demonstrate that our proposed RAG method outperforms baselines, and our CA-CLAP achieves better results than text-only retrieval methods."},

Our approach is trained on merged emotional speech and text datasets and varies prompts in each training iteration to increase the generalization capabilities of the model.

To implement this text-based style predictor, we design a style module incorporating residual vector quantization. Furthermore, the style representation is enhanced through style-to-text alignment and a mel decoder with style hierarchical layer normalization (SHLN).

The proposed framework consists of a two-stage-downsampling-based encoder, a quantizer, and a two-stage-upsampling-based decoder. The encoder initially reduces the bandwidth of the high-sampling-rate waveform before encoding it. Therefore, the discrete tokens outputted by the quantizer are derived from the low-sampling-rate waveform, resulting in a low bitrate. The decoder decodes the low-sampling-rate waveform and ultimately recovers the original high-sampling-rate waveform by bandwidth recovery. Experiments confirm that our proposed framework achieves high-quality audio coding at a sampling rate of 48 kHz and a bitrate of only 1 kbps. The bitrate savings amount to 6 times compared to baseline codecs without bandwidth reduction and recovery."},

{"title": "DiffATR: Diffusion-based Generative Modeling for Audio-Text Retrieval", "authors": "Yifei Xin, Xuxin Cheng, Zhihong Zhu, Xusheng Yang, Yuexian Zou", "abstract": "Existing audio-text retrieval (ATR) methods are essentially discriminative models that aim to maximize the conditional likelihood, represented as p(candidates|query). Nevertheless, this methodology fails to consider the intrinsic data distribution p(query), leading to difficulties in discerning out-of-distribution data. In this work, we attempt to tackle this constraint through a generative perspective and model the relationship between audio and text as their joint probability p(candidates, query). To this end, we present a diffusion-based ATR framework (DiffATR), which models ATR as an iterative procedure that progressively generates joint distribution from noise. Throughout its training phase, DiffATR is optimized from both generative and discriminative viewpoints: the generator is refined through a generation loss, while the feature extractor benefits from a contrastive loss, thus combining the merits of both methodologies. Experiments on the AudioCaps and Clotho datasets with superior performances, verify the effectiveness of our approach. Notably, without any alterations, our DiffATR consistently exhibits strong performance in out-of-domain retrieval settings."},

The conventional method that jointly estimates ASR and SD requires non-overlapping speech and a  separate clustering-based SD component for accurately identifying speakers. However, the speech is often overlapped, which deteriorates speaker identification performance, and the separate model makes the whole system sub-optimal. To address this problem, our idea is to build a sequential output model that outputs transcriptions, timestamps, and newly introduced speaker identifiers recursively from overlapped speech. Since speaker identifier do not fully represent the speaker characteristics of unknown speakers, SOMSRED utilizes the intermediate feature as speaker embeddings. Experimental results show the efficacy of the proposed method in speaker recognition, SD, and multi-talker ASR."},
{"title": "Song Data Cleansing for End-to-End Neural Singer Diarization Using Neural Analysis and Synthesis Framework", "authors": "Hokuto Munakata, Ryo Terashima, Yusuke Fujita", "abstract": "We propose a data cleansing method that utilizes a neural analysis and synthesis (NANSY++) framework to train an end-to-end neural diarization model (EEND) for singer diarization. Our proposed model converts song data with choral singing commonly contained in popular music and unsuitable for generating a simulated dataset to the solo singing data. This cleansing is based on NANSY++, which is a framework trained to reconstruct an input non-overlapped audio signal. We exploit the pre-trained NANSY++ to convert choral singing into clean, non-overlapped audio. This cleansing process mitigates the mislabeling of choral singing to solo singing and helps the effective training of EEND models even when the majority of available song data contains choral singing sections. We experimentally evaluated the EEND model trained with a dataset using our proposed method using annotated popular duet songs. As a result, our proposed method improved 14.8 points in diarization error rate."},
{"title": "Speaker Change Detection with Weighted-sum Knowledge Distillation based on Self-supervised Pre-trained Models", "authors": "Hang Su, Yuxiang Kong, Lichun Fan, Peng Gao, Yujun Wang, Zhiyong Wu", "abstract": "Speaker Change Detection (SCD) is an essential problem in speech processing and has various applications in many fields. The self-supervised models have shown impressive performance on many downstream tasks in the pre-training and fine-tuning paradigm. However, it has limitations to apply a fine-tuned self-supervised pre-trained model to frame-level SCD task in real industry because it typically requires a smaller model that consumes fewer computational resources. To tackle this issue, we propose using Knowledge Distillation (KD) to leverage the capabilities of the self-supervised model. First, a basic KD method based on the pre-trained model is proposed. Then, a weighted-sum KD method is proposed to selectively extract information from the pre-trained model. Experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness of the basic KD method as well as a further improvement for the weighted-sum KD method. The proposed method is more suitable for industrial applications compared with fine-tuning."},
{"title": "AG-LSEC: Audio Grounded Lexical Speaker Error Correction", "authors": "Rohit Paturi, Xiang Li, Sundararajan Srinivasan", "abstract": "Speaker Diarization (SD) systems are typically audio-based and operate independently of the ASR system in traditional speech transcription pipelines and can have speaker errors due to SD and/or ASR reconciliation, especially around speaker turns and regions of speech overlap. To reduce these errors, a Lexical Speaker Error Correction (LSEC), in which an external language model provides lexical information to correct the speaker errors, was recently proposed. Though the approach achieves good Word Diarization error rate (WDER) improvements, it does not use any additional acoustic information and is prone to miscorrections. In this paper, we propose to enhance and acoustically ground the LSEC system with speaker scores directly derived from the existing SD pipeline. This approach achieves significant relative WDER reductions in the range of 25-40% over the audio-based SD, ASR system and beats the LSEC system by 15-25% relative on RT03-CTS, Callhome American English and Fisher datasets."},

Results show that the proposed system often achieves lower language classification and language diarization error rates (up to 10% relative language diarization error reduction and 60% relative language confusion reduction) and leads to lower WERs on multilingual test sets (more than 8% relative WER reduction), while at the same time does not negatively affect speech recognition on monolingual audio (with an absolute WER increase between 0.1% and 0.7% w.r.t. monolingual ASR)."},

By integrating a generative model and the energy margin loss, our approach aims to enhance the robustness of dialect identification systems. Furthermore, we explore two OOD scores for OOD dialect detection, and our findings conclusively demonstrate that the energy score outperforms the softmax score. Leveraging Sharpness-Aware Minimization to optimize the training process of the joint model, we enhance model generalization by minimizing both loss and sharpness. Experiments conducted on dialect identification tasks validate the efficacy of Energy-Based Models  and provide valuable insights into their performance."},

{"title": "ASoBO: Attentive Beamformer Selection for Distant Speaker Diarization in Meetings", "authors": "Théo Mariotte, Anthony Larcher, Silvio Montrésor, Jean-Hugh Thomas", "abstract": "Speaker Diarization (SD) aims at grouping speech segments that belong to the same speaker. This task is required in many speech-processing applications, such as rich meeting transcription. In this context, distant microphone arrays usually capture the audio signal. Beamforming, i.e., spatial filtering, is a common practice to process multi-microphone audio data. However, it often requires an explicit localization of the active source to steer the filter. This paper proposes a self-attention-based algorithm to select the output of a bank of fixed spatial filters. This method serves as a feature extractor for joint Voice Activity (VAD) and Overlapped Speech Detection (OSD). The speaker diarization is then inferred from the detected segments. The approach shows convincing distant VAD, OSD, and SD performance, e.g. 14.5% DER on the AISHELL-4 dataset. The analysis of the self-attention weights demonstrates their explainability, as they correlate with the speaker's angular locations."},

Particularly in the presence of overlapping or noisy speech, these systems have problems reliably assigning the correct speaker labels, leading to a significant amount of speaker confusion errors. We propose to add segment-level speaker reassignment to address this issue. By revisiting, after speech enhancement, the speaker attribution for each segment, speaker confusion errors from the initial diarization stage are significantly reduced. Through experiments across different system configurations and datasets, we further demonstrate the effectiveness and applicability in various domains. Our results show that segment-level speaker reassignment successfully rectifies at least 40% of speaker confusion word errors, highlighting its potential for enhancing diarization accuracy in meeting transcription systems."},

Specifically, we first adapt CycleGAN to generate synthetic data, transforming samples between source and target corpora, to enhance the variability of source data. Then, an emotion-guided contrastive learning module is introduced to jointly optimize original and synthetic data during training, leading to better class-level feature alignment. We conduct experiments on eNTERFACE, CASIA and EmoDB datasets with six different settings for evaluation. Extensive results confirm the excellent performance of C2GAN over other state-of-the-art methods."},

Specifically, we explore the effectiveness of a pre trained Wav2vec2 (w2v2) model-based classifier within the deep RL setting. We evaluate the proposed deep RL framework using five publicly available datasets and benchmark the results with three recent SER studies using two deep RL methods. Based on the results, we show that the transformer-based RL agent not only demonstrates an improvement in SER accuracy but also shows a reduction in the time taken to begin emotion classification, outpacing the RNNs that have been commonly used to date. Moreover, by leveraging pre-trained transformers, we observe a reduced need for extensive pre-training which has been a norm in prior research."},

Results are always reported on the official test set with a separate validation set only used for early stopping. Most models score below or close to the official baseline, while they marginally outperform the original challenge winners after hyperparameter tuning. Our work illustrates that, despite recent progress, FAU-AIBO remains a very challenging benchmark. An interesting corollary is that newer methods do not consistently outperform older ones, showing that progress towards `solving' SER is not necessarily monotonic."},

However, the current research field of SER has long suffered from the following problems: 1) There are few reasonable and universal splits of the datasets, making comparing different models and methods difficult. 2) No commonly used benchmark covers numerous corpus and languages for researchers to refer to, making reproduction a burden. In this paper, we propose EmoBox, an out-of-the box multilingual multi-corpus speech emotion recognition toolkit, along with a benchmark for both intra-corpus and cross-corpus settings. For intra-corpus settings, we carefully designed the data partitioning for different datasets. For cross-corpus settings, we employ a foundation SER model, emotion2vec, to mitigate annotation errors and obtain a test set that is fully balanced in speakers and emotions distributions. Based on EmoBox, we present the intra-corpus SER results of 10 pre-trained speech models on 32 emotion datasets with 14 languages, and the cross-corpus SER results on 4 datasets with the fully balanced test sets. To the best of our knowledge, this is the largest SER benchmark, across language scopes and quantity scales. We hope that our toolkit and benchmark can facilitate the research of SER in the community."},

A wide range of voice quality measures were extracted, including spectral tilts and harmonics-to-noise ratios, cepstral peak prominence (CPP), f0, and formants. Through comparative acoustic and linear discriminant analysis, this study identifies measures susceptible to recording conditions and those that robustly contribute to the differentiation of voice qualities in telephone recordings. Harmonic amplitudes H1H2c and H1c, CPP, and f0 are most reliable voice quality measures across studio and VoIP conditions."},

We investigated the two falling diphthongs /ai/ and /au/ from a Standard Mandarin reading text corpus. A set of GAMMs models was employed to test whether and how tones and f0 influence the diphthong realizations. The results show the vowel height (reflected by F1) to differ with respect to tones: with a high tone, the diphthongs tend to be realized as more closed, and as more open with a low tone; with a rising tone, they tend to have a typical diphthongized realization, with a dynamical pattern of F1 contour; and to be monophthongized with a falling tone. The interaction between f0 and F1 extensively confirmed in monophthongs across languages, is equally applicable to /ai/ and /au/: f0 is negatively correlated with F1. The results show the universality of the tonal effect on vowel realization in different diphthongs and imply physiological factors behind it."},

This work exploits band-limited cepstral coefficients (BLCCs) to locate such regions and quantify their sensitivity through vowel classification. BLCCs are acoustic parameters representing sub-band spectra; their extraction involves a linear transformation of full-band CCs with flexible sub-band selection. Here, 18 sub-bands spanning the full band [0-4 kHz] and their respective BLCCs are used to classify Japanese vowels from 306 native male speakers. Classification accuracy is high in sub-bands where phonetic differences between vowels are the most significant. Such sub-bands are mainly in the low frequency range as expected, but do not exclusively align with formant regions. These findings suggest that BLCCs are potentially very useful for gaining detailed phonetic insights with flexible sub-band focus and efficient computation."},

To align data from Panãra, an Amazonian indigenous language of Brazil, we investigated three approaches for forced alignment of low-resource languages using the Montreal Forced Aligner. First, we implemented a novel approach of manipulating the acoustic model granularity from phone-specific to increasingly broader natural class categories in training language-specific Panãra models. Second, we trained cross-language English models under two granularity settings. Third, we compared these models to a large, pretrained Global English acoustic model. Results showed that broadening phone categories can improve language-specific modeling, but cross-language modeling performed the best."},

By fully integrating LLMs, we achieve results comparable to the state-of-the-art cascade models. Our findings underscore the immense potential of E2E frameworks in speech neuroprosthesis, particularly as the technology behind brain-computer interfaces (BCIs) and the availability of relevant datasets continue to evolve. This work not only showcases the efficacy of combining LLMs with E2E decoding for enhancing speech neuroprosthesis but also sets a new direction for future research in BCI applications, underscoring the impact of LLMs in decoding complex neural signals for communication restoration.

{"title": "From Sound to Meaning in the Auditory Cortex: A Neuronal Representation and Classification Analysis", "authors": "Kumar Neelabh, Vishnu Sreekumar", "abstract": "The neural mechanisms underlying the comprehension of meaningful sounds are yet to be fully understood. While previous work has shown that the auditory cortex can classify auditory stimuli into distinct semantic categories, the specific functions of the primary (A1) and the secondary auditory cortex (A2) are not well understood. We analyzed the neural responses of songbirds as they listened to their entire vocal repertoire. We first show that the distances between semantic categories in acoustic and neural representations are correlated in both A1 and A2. We then show that while both A1 and A2 are equally informative of the acoustic category of the vocalizations, A2 is significantly more informative of their semantic category. Additionally, we show that the semantic categories are more separated in A2. These findings suggest that as the incoming signal moves downstream within the auditory cortex, its acoustic information is preserved, while its semantic information is enhanced."},

While large language model (LLM)-based fMRI encoding has shown promise, existing studies predominantly focus on healthy, young adults, overlooking older NCD populations and cognitive level correlations. This paper explores language-related functional changes in older NCD adults using LLM-based fMRI encoding and brain scores, addressing current limitations. We analyze the correlation between brain scores and cognitive scores at both whole-brain and language-related ROI levels. Our findings reveal that higher cognitive abilities correspond to better brain scores, with correlations peaking in the middle temporal gyrus. This study highlights the potential of fMRI encoding models and brain scores for detecting early functional changes in NCD patients."},

This study aims to profile various NDs using speech and ocular movements collected during the Cookie Thief Picture description task. We designed new multi-modal features centered around the Areas of Interest (AoIs) to quantify attention focus and search patterns. Through statistical analysis, we examined which features differentiated controls (CTLs) from subjects with various NDs, including Alzheimer’s disease (AD), Parkinson’s disease (PD), and Parkinson’s disease mimics (PDM). Results showed that subjects with AD and PDM had reduced AoI visits, indicating diminished search behavior. In contrast, subjects with PD displayed increased variability in visual search patterns, possibly reflecting disruptions in integrating visual information with verbal expression and loss of attention during the trial. These features effectively differentiated ND groups from CTLs and among themselves."},

However, it still remains unclear if this similarity can be used to optimize the pre-trained speech models. In this work, we therefore propose to use the brain activations recorded by fMRI to refine the often-used wav2vec2.0 model by aligning model representations toward human neural responses. Experimental results on SUPERB reveal that this operation is beneficial for several downstream tasks, e.g., speaker verification, automatic speech recognition, intent classification. One can then consider the proposed method as a new alternative to improve self-supervised speech models."},

Our work is the first to collect a new English speech dataset wherein we have induced acute pain in adults using a cold pressor task protocol and recorded subjects reading sentences out loud. We report pain discrimination performance as F1 scores from binary (pain vs. no pain) and three-class (mild, moderate, severe) prediction tasks, and support our results with explainable feature analysis.

Although current clinical practice uses measures from brief laboratory recordings to assess vocal function, it is unclear how these relate to an individual’s habitual voice use. The purpose of this study was to quantify the correlation and offset between voice features computed from laboratory and ambulatory recordings in speakers with and without vocal hyperfunction. Features derived from a neck-surface accelerometer included estimates of sound pressure level, fundamental frequency, cepstral peak prominence, and spectral tilt. Whereas some measures from laboratory recordings correlated significantly with those captured during daily life, only approximately 6–52% of the actual variance was accounted for. Thus, brief voice assessments are quite limited in the extent to which they can accurately characterize the daily voice use of speakers with and without vocal hyperfunction."},

This paper investigates the extent to which the choice for either K-means or hierarchical clustering, two of the most popular clustering methods, leads to grouping differences that are potentially relevant for intonation research. This is tested using a dataset of f0 measures taken from imitated intonation patterns in American English. The analysis concerns a generic correlation test between K-means and hierarchical clustering outcomes as well as a number of specific measures assessing partitioning quality and f0 contour differences. The results show that both cluster methods generally show very similar outcomes, although considerable differences for specific clusterings might occur."},

Our study demonstrates notable performance improvements by utilizing SSL embeddings compared to conventional speech features. We compare various types of SSL pretrained models to elucidate the type of speech information (semantic, speaker, or prosodic) that contributes the most in identifying different symptoms.

We propose FESDE, a novel framework for Fully-End-to-end Speech Decoding from EEG signals. Our approach aims to directly reconstruct listened speech waveforms given EEG signals, where no intermediate acoustic feature processing step is required. The proposed method consists of an EEG module and a speech module along with a connector. The EEG module learns to better represent EEG signals, while the speech module generates speech waveforms from model representations. The connector learns to bridge the distributions of the latent spaces of EEG and speech. The proposed framework is both simple and efficient, by allowing single-step inference, and outperforms prior works on objective metrics. A fine-grained phoneme analysis is conducted to unveil model characteristics of speech decoding. The source code is available here: github.com/lee-jhwn/fesde."},

There are growing concerns that these reported performances are often overestimated, especially in small-scale cross-sectional studies. Possible causes for this overestimation include overfitting, publication biases and a lack of standard procedures to report findings and testing methodology. Another key source of misrepresentation is the reliance on aggregate-level performance metrics. Speech is a highly variable signal that can be affected by factors including age, sex, and accent, which can easily bias models. We highlight this impact by presenting a simple benchmark model for assessing the extent to which aggregate metrics exaggerate the efficacy of a machine learning model in the presence of confounders. We then demonstrate the usefulness of this model on exemplar speech-health assessment datasets."},

Achieving a Pearson Correlation Coefficient of 0.6566 with human-rated scores, the proposed method showcases its potential as an accessible and objective tool for the assessment of ASD."},

Previous work has shown that it is possible to distinguish between a pre- and a post-treatment state using automatic analysis of read speech. In this contribution, we examine whether sustained vowels can provide a complementary lens for telling apart these two states. Using a cohort of 50 patients, we show that the inclusion of sustained vowels can improve performance to up to 79% unweighted average recall, from a 71% baseline using read speech. We further identify and interpret the most important acoustic features that characterise the manifestation of COPD in sustained vowels."},

However, many state-of-the-art SQA have memory and compute costs that scale linearly with the length of the input audio context, making them infeasible to apply on long speech recordings (meetings, podcasts, etc.). This paper proposes a method which uses deep Q-learning to learn a policy for skipping over irrelevant audio segments in a longer audio file without analyzing them for more efficient SQA. In this framework, an agent model is trained on BERT sentence embeddings extracted from lightweight ASR transcripts to make decisions on how far it can safely skip through an audio file in order to move closer to the target answer span.

This poses a significant challenge for current audio deepfake detection (ADD) models based on vocoder artifacts. To effectively detect LLM-based deepfake audio, we focus on the core of the generation process, the conversion from neural codec to waveform.

In contrast, ``textless'' methods process speech representations without ASR systems, enabling the direct use of acoustic speech features. Although their effectiveness is shown in capturing acoustic features, it is unclear in capturing lexical knowledge. This paper proposes a textless method for dependency parsing, examining its effectiveness and limitations. Our proposed method predicts a dependency tree from a speech signal  without transcribing, representing the tree as a labeled sequence. scading method outperforms the textless method in overall parsing accuracy, the latter excels in instances with important acoustic features. Our findings highlight the importance of fusing word-level representations and sentence-level prosody for enhanced parsing performance. The code and models are made publicly available."},

Recent studies often rely on large language models (LLMs), leading to excessive footprints and complexity. This paper proposes the use of Whisper, a standalone speech processing model, for zero-shot end-to-end (E2E) SLU. To handle unseen semantic labels, SLU tasks are integrated into a question-answering (QA) framework, which prompts the Whisper decoder for semantics deduction. The system is efficiently trained with prefix-tuning, optimising a minimal set of parameters rather than the entire Whisper model. We show that the proposed system achieves a 40.7% absolute gain for slot filling (SLU-F1) on SLURP compared to a recently introduced zero-shot benchmark. Furthermore, it performs comparably to a Whisper-GPT-2 modular system under both in-corpus and cross-corpus evaluation settings, but with a relative 34.8% reduction in model parameters."},

To address this challenge, we propose an ASR-Robust NLU (AR-NLU) framework that extends a pre-existing NLU model by training it simultaneously on two input streams: human generated or gold transcripts and noisy ASR transcripts. We apply contrastive learning to make the model learn the same representations and predictions for both gold and ASR inputs, thereby enhancing its robustness against ASR noises. To demonstrate the effectiveness of this framework, we present two AR-NLU models: a Robust Intent DEtection (RIDE) and ASR-Robust BI-encoder for NameD Entity Recognition (AR-BINDER). Experimental results show that our proposed AR-NLU framework is applicable to various NLU models and significantly outperforms the original models in both sequence and token classification tasks."},

Current popular methods involve feeding the N-best ASR output into LLMs. Although this approach demonstrates improved results, obtaining N-best hypotheses is time-consuming and unavailable sometimes. To develop a more general method, this paper investigates LLM-based ASR error correction with 1-best hypotheses. We fine-tuned a multilingual LLM covering more than 100 languages and let it correct 1-best hypotheses errors from different speech foundation models. The experiment shows that the proposed method effectively enhances the ASR result only using 1-best hypotheses. Moreover, we also noticed that knowledge-transferring between the languages using the same writing system in the LLM can effectively correct low-resourced languages' hypotheses."},

To address this challenge, our study proposes to leverage extensive text-only datasets and contextualize pre-trained ASR models using a straightforward text-augmentation (TA) technique, all while keeping computational costs minimal. In particular, to contextualize a pre-trained CIF-based ASR, we construct a codebook using limited speech-text data. By utilizing a simple codebook lookup process, we convert available text-only data into latent text embeddings. These embeddings then enhance the inputs for the contextualized ASR. Our experiments on diverse Mandarin test sets demonstrate that our TA approach significantly boosts recognition performance. The top-performing system shows relative CER improvements of up to 30% on rare words and 15% across all words in general."},

It is typically applied to minibatch gradients to prevent gradient explosion, and to the individual sample gradients to mitigate unintended memorization. This work systematically investigates the impact of a specific granularity of gradient clipping, namely per-core clipping (PCC), across training a wide range of ASR models. We empirically demonstrate that PCC can effectively mitigate unintended memorization in ASR models. Surprisingly, we find that PCC positively influences ASR performance metrics, leading to improved convergence rates and reduced word error rates. To avoid tuning the additional hyperparameter introduced by PCC, we further propose a novel variant, adaptive per-core clipping (APCC), for streamlined optimization. Our findings highlight the multifaceted benefits of PCC as a strategy for robust, privacy-forward ASR model training."},

Traditional speaker adaptation methodologies typically involve fine-tuning models for each speaker, but this strategy is cost-prohibitive and inconvenient for disabled users, requiring substantial data collection. To address this issue, we introduce a prototype-based approach that markedly improves DSR performance for unseen dysarthric speakers without additional fine-tuning. Our method employs a feature extractor trained with HuBERT to produce per-word prototypes that encapsulate the characteristics of previously unseen speakers. These prototypes serve as the basis for classification. Additionally, we incorporate supervised contrastive learning to refine feature extraction. By enhancing representation quality, we further improve DSR performance, enabling effective personalized DSR."},

Motivated by the data scarcity problem, as well as by successful applications of self-supervised learning (SSL) in ASR for low-resource languages, this paper investigates and evaluates the effectiveness of three different data-centric SSL training strategies in improving Dutch dysarthric speech recognition. The first strategy involves fine-tuning with both dysarthric and healthy speech data, the second with disease-specific data and the third with speaker-specific data. The first and third strategies are proven effective, while the second one, though ineffective, provides valuable insights for further research."},

Our findings suggest that 1) English and Mandarin wav2vec 2.0 models learn contextual representations of abstract suprasegmental categories which are strongest in the middle third of the network. 2) Models are better at representing features that exist in the language of their training data, and this difference is driven by enriched context in transformer blocks, not local acoustic representation. 3) Fine-tuned wav2vec 2.0 improves performance in later layers compared to pre-trained models mainly for lexically contrastive features like tone and stress, 4) HuBERT and WavLM learn similar representations to wav2vec 2.0, differing mainly in later layer performance.

Previous works purify the malicious adversarial perturbations through pre-processing data from the time and frequency domain information. However, these methods either have a weak purification capacity or require a significant purification cost. To tackle this problem, we propose a real-time and efficient purification-based defense method DualPure, which combines the two defense aspects in the time and frequency domain for copurification. Specifically, we first disrupt the potential malicious perturbation in the sample at the waveform level and then apply an unconditional diffusion model to purify the feature at the frequency level. Numerous experiments show that the proposed method can effectively purify and achieve good adversarial robustness in white-box attacks (+ 6.3%) and black-box attacks (+  1.08%)."},

Our data augmentation technique enriches training datasets with various disfluencies, enhancing ASR processing of these speech patterns. Results show that fine-tuning wav2vec 2.0 with even a relatively small, labeled dataset, alongside data augmentation, can significantly reduce word error rates for disfluent speech. Our approach not only advances ASR inclusivity for people who stutter, but also paves the way for ASRs that can accommodate wider speech variations."},

Disfluency labeling for automatic speech recognition (ASR) aims at editing these phenomena in the transcription to improve overall recognition accuracy. Such labeling techniques typically delete non-lexical/disfluent labels from the prediction, where classical ASR techniques either ignore or treat them as lexical items. Our results, obtained by systematic comparison and detailed evaluation of various disfluency labeling methods on two different language conversational corpora, suggest that neither of the previous approaches are optimal. We propose to distinguish between filled pauses and meaningful conversational grunts and show that keeping the non-lexical labels is not only possible but as low as 7% label error rates can be achieved for highly important categories (including 'mhm') while preserving a decent WER."},

These entities serve as prompts for the Whisper decoder. To optimize the model, we propose a multitask training approach that learns OV-KWS and contextual-ASR tasks. We evaluate our approach on Chinese Aishell hot word subsets and two internal code-switching test sets and show that it significantly improves the entity recall compared to the original Whisper model.

We show that some of these strategies are highly sensitive to the correctness of language information being used during inference, and also demonstrate that introducing a small amount of language label noise during training can greatly improve the model’s robustness to incorrect language information. As multilingual ASR continues to become more common, this work demonstrates the importance of understanding the sensitivity of these models to language inputs and ensuring models are robust to errors."},

We hypothesise that this is because CL of the auto-regressive decoder in the MASR model is difficult. To verify this, we propose four optimizations on the decoder. They include decoder-layer gradient surgery, freezing unused token embeddings, suppressing output of newly added tokens, and learning rate re-scaling. Our experiments on adapting Whisper to 10 unseen languages from the Common Voice dataset demonstrate that these optimizations reduce the Average Word Error Rate (AWER) of pretrained languages from 14.2% to 12.4% compared with Experience Replay, without compromising the AWER of new languages."},

The results show that framing differentiated MOS responses, with individual TTS performance varying significantly across tasks and framings. This corroborates the assumption that decontextualized MOS evaluations do not generalize, and suggests that TTS evaluations should not be reported without the type of framing that was employed, if any."},

Third, we propose a low-rank adaptation scheme with a phoneme fidelity loss to improve content preservation in the enhanced speech. In the experiments, we train a universal enhancement model on a large scale dataset of speech degraded by noise, reverberation, and various distortions. The results on multiple public benchmark datasets demonstrate that UNIVERSE++ compares favorably to both discriminative and generative baselines for a wide range of qualitative and intelligibility metrics."},

This benchmark treats the models as feature extractors and uses a single shallow downstream model, which can be fine-tuned for a downstream task. However, real-world use cases may require different configurations. This paper presents ML-SUPERB 2.0, which is a new benchmark for evaluating pre-trained SSL and supervised speech models across downstream models, fine-tuning setups, and efficient model adaptation approaches. We find performance improvements over the setup of ML-SUPERB. However, performance depends on the downstream model design. Also, we find large performance differences between languages and datasets, suggesting the need for more targeted approaches to improve multilingual ASR performance."},

Plumbley", "abstract": "Significant improvement has been achieved in automated audio captioning (AAC) with recent models. However, these models have become increasingly large as their performance is enhanced. In this work, we propose a knowledge distillation (KD) framework for AAC. Our analysis shows that in the encoder-decoder based AAC models, it is more effective to distill knowledge into the encoder as compared with the decoder. To this end, we incorporate encoder-level KD loss into training, in addition to the standard supervised loss and sequence-level KD loss. We investigate two encoder-level KD methods, based on mean squared error (MSE) loss and contrastive loss, respectively. Experimental results demonstrate that contrastive KD is more robust than MSE KD, exhibiting superior performance in data-scarce situations. By leveraging audio-only data into training in the KD framework, our student model achieves competitive performance, with an inference speed that is 19 times faster."},

However, their impressive performance often comes at the cost of high memory usage, slow inference speed, and considerable model delay, rendering them impractical for real-world AT applications. In this study, we introduce streaming audio transformers (SAT) that combine the vision transformer (ViT) architecture with Transformer-Xl-like chunk processing, enabling efficient processing of long-range audio signals. Our proposed SAT is benchmarked against other transformer-based SOTA methods, achieving significant improvements in terms of mean average precision (mAP) at a delay of 2s and 1s, while also exhibiting significantly lower memory usage and computational overhead."},

Specifically, CLAP-style models are able to 'answer' a diverse set of language queries, extending the capabilities of audio models beyond a closed set of labels. However, CLAP relies on a large set of (audio, query) pairs for pretraining. While such sets are available for general audio tasks, like captioning or sound event detection, there are no datasets with matched audio and text queries for computational paralinguistic (CP) tasks. As a result, the community relies on generic CLAP models trained for general audio with limited success. In the present study, we explore training considerations for ParaCLAP, a CLAP-style model suited to CP, including a novel process for creating audio-language queries. We demonstrate its effectiveness on a set of computational paralinguistic tasks, where it is shown to surpass the performance of open-source state-of-the-art models.

Plumbley", "abstract": "This paper presents a novel approach to make convolutional neural networks (CNNs) efficient by reducing their computa- tional cost and memory footprint. Even though large-scale CNNs show state-of-the-art performance in many tasks, high computational costs and the requirement of a large memory footprint make them resource-hungry. Therefore, deploying large-scale CNNs on resource-constrained devices poses significant challenges. To address this challenge, we propose to use quaternion CNNs, where quaternion algebra enables the memory footprint to be reduced. Furthermore, we investigate methods to reduce the memory footprint and computational cost further through pruning the quaternion CNNs. Experimental evaluation of the audio tagging task involving the classification of 527 audio events from AudioSet shows that the quaternion algebra and pruning reduce memory footprint by 90% and computational cost by 70% compared to the original CNN model while maintaining similar performance."},

To tackle this issue, we present a novel ATR framework that leverages two-stream Transformers in conjunction with a Hierarchical Alignment (THA) module to identify multi-level correspondences of different Transformer blocks between audio and text. Moreover, current ATR methods mainly focus on learning a global-level representation, missing out on intricate details to capture audio occurrences that correspond to textual semantics. To bridge this gap, we introduce a Disentangled Cross-modal Representation (DCR) approach that disentangles high-dimensional features into compact latent factors to grasp finegrained audio-text semantic correlations. Additionally, we develop a confidence-aware (CA) module to estimate the confidence of each latent factor pair and adaptively aggregate cross-modal latent factors to achieve local semantic alignment. Experiments show that our THA effectively boosts ATR performance, with the DCR approach further contributing to consistent performance gains."},

Recently, the advancements in large language models (LLMs), with improvements in training approaches for audio encoders, have opened up possibilities for improving AAC. Thus, we explore enhancing AAC from three aspects: 1) a pre-trained audio encoder via consistent ensemble distillation (CED) is used to improve the effectivity of acoustic tokens, with a querying transformer (Q-Former) bridging the modality gap to LLM and compress acoustic tokens; 2) we investigate the advantages of using a LLAMA 2 with 7B parameters as the decoder; 3) another pre-trained LLM corrects text errors caused by insufficient training data and annotation ambiguities. Both the audio encoder and text decoder are optimized by low-rank adaptation (LoRA). Experiments show that each of these enhancements is effective.

In PFCA-Net, the encoder is constructed using a pyramid network, facilitating the extraction of audio features across multiple scales. It achieves this by combining top-down and bottom-up connections to fuse features across scales, resulting in feature maps at various scales. In the decoder, cross-content attention is designed to fuse the different scale features which allows the propagation of information from a low-scale to a high-scale. Experimental results show that PFCA-Net achieves considerable improvement over existing models."},

To this end, we introduce a novel methodology within the realm of few-shot learning, named Dual Graph Prototypical Network (DGPN), in view of  this limitation for the Speech Spoofing Algorithm Recognition (SSAR) task. The proposed method consists of intra-speech graph and inter-speech graph modules, where the former employs graph attention networks to model the low-level representations of an utterance, and the latter utilizes graph neural networks to depict high-level representations of different utterances. Experimental evaluations demonstrate that the proposed method outperforms existing models in classification accuracy, showcasing its effectiveness in addressing the challenge of the few-shot SSAR task."},

Specifically, we propose a class activation representation to localize the discriminative frames contributing to detection. Furthermore, we demonstrate that multi-label training based on spoofing types, rather than binary labels as bonafide and spoofed, enables the model to learn distinct characteristics of different attacks, significantly improving detection performance.

Recent work shows that countermeasures (CMs) trained on partially spoofed audio can effectively detect such spoofing. However, the current understanding of the decision-making process of CMs is limited. We utilize Grad-CAM and introduce a quantitative analysis metric to interpret CMs' decisions. We find that CMs prioritize the artifacts of transition regions created when concatenating bona fide and spoofed audio. This focus differs from that of CMs trained on fully spoofed audio, which concentrate on the pattern differences between bona fide and spoofed parts. Our further investigation explains the varying nature of  CMs' focus while making correct or incorrect predictions. These insights provide a basis for the design of CM models and the creation of datasets. Moreover, this work lays a foundation of interpretability in the field of partial spoofed audio detection that has not been well explored previously."},

Many score-level fusion methods have been proposed, but many remain heuristic. This paper revisits score-level fusion using tools from decision theory and presents three main findings. First, fusion by summing the ASV and CM scores can be interpreted on the basis of compositional data analysis, and score calibration before fusion is essential. Second, the interpretation leads to an improved fusion method that linearly combines the log-likelihood ratios of ASV and CM. However, as the third finding reveals, this linear combination is inferior to a non-linear one in making optimal decisions. The outcomes of these findings, namely, the score calibration before fusion, improved linear fusion, and better non-linear fusion, were found to be effective on the SASV challenge database."},

Therapist empathy is an essential indicator of counseling quality and assessed subjectively by considering the entire conversation. This paper proposes to encode long counseling conversation using a hierarchical attention network. Conversations with extreme values of empathy rating are used to train a Siamese network based encoder with contrastive loss. Two-level attention mechanisms are applied to learn the importance weights of individual speaker turns and groups of turns in the conversation. Experimental results show that the use of contrastive loss is effective in encouraging the conversation encoder to learn discriminative embeddings that are related to therapist empathy. The distances between conversation embeddings positively correlate with the differences in the respective empathy scores. The learned conversation embeddings can be used to predict the subjective rating of therapist empathy."},

Using a dataset of sarcastic utterances compiled from television shows, we analyze the prosodic features within utterances and key phrases belonging to three distinct sarcasm categories (embedded, propositional, and illocutionary), which vary in the degree of semantic cues present, and compare them to neutral expressions. Results show that in phrases where the sarcastic meaning is salient from the semantics, the prosodic cues are less relevant than when the sarcastic meaning is not evident from the semantics, suggesting a trade-off between prosodic and semantic cues of sarcasm at the phrase level. These findings highlight a lessened reliance on prosodic modulation in semantically dense sarcastic expressions and a nuanced interaction that shapes the communication of sarcastic intent."},

Eight trained public speakers are recorded while performing the same investor pitch twice, once in an emotionally-neutral matter-of-fact fashion and once charismatically, i.e. in an expressive, committed onstage presentation style. The recorded presentations were rated by 21 listeners for their degree of perceived speaker charisma – and additionally acoustically analyzed in terms of established duration-based rhythm measures such as ∅, Δ, and PVI. We find significant rhythmic differences between the matter-of-fact and charismatic presentation performances and, in conjunction with the perception results, we show that consonantal rhythmic elements play a bigger role in the perception than in the production of a rhythmic charisma, and that especially the duration variation of larger rhythm elements correlates positively and gender-independently with charisma ratings. The findings are discussed in light of previous studies with their practical implications."},

Motivated by this observation, we propose a novel use of voice conversion (VC) for SER, which effectively enhances emotion recognition performance on an unlabeled dataset. Our approach involves leveraging the simplicity and efficacy of the k-nearest neighbor (kNN)-based VC technique to transform speech samples from the unlabeled domain to the labeled domain. In contrast to conventional domain adaptation methods, our approach avoids re-training of a model on transformed unlabeled data.

We observed the impact of pauses within phrases (WP) and incorrectly stressed words on real-time perceived comprehensibility. Sixty native English listeners were asked, while listening to short recordings of L2 speakers, to click on a button whenever they were struggling to understand the speaker. Analysis showed that click frequency tends to increase after WP pauses and incorrectly stressed words, especially 2-3 s after onset, while it remains under the average click frequency after pauses between clauses and correctly stressed words. These results demonstrate that WP pauses and incorrect stress patterns directly impact the listener's perception, and that this impact can measured with a dynamic rating protocol. Moreover, such a protocol appears to be a promising tool to expand our knowledge about real-time comprehension of L2 speech."},

Despite significant progress in both speech/language processing and speech enhancement technology, conversational speech processing remains challenging. Recordings of conversations with distant microphones contain ambient noise, reverberation, and speaker overlap that changes as the conversation progresses. Consequently, recognizing conversational speech is much more challenging than single-talker speech recognition, and frontend technologies such as speech enhancement and speaker diarization are essential to achieving highly accurate conversational speech processing. \nFor more than two decades, the presenter‘s research group has explored frontend techniques (source separation, dereverberation, noise reduction, and diarization) for handling realistic natural conversations with distant microphones. In this talk, I would like to talk about the evolution and frontier of frontend technologies for conversational signal processing. Specifically, we will trace the evolution of multichannel signal processing and neural network techniques, including beamforming and target speaker tracking and extraction, which have always played an important role in successive cutting-edge frontends, along with the latest achievements."},

Creaky voice, often used by speakers to convey sociolinguistic cues, presents challenges to speech processing due to its complex phonation characteristics. The primary goal of CreakVC is to enable in-depth research into how these cues are perceived, using systematic perceptual studies. CreakVC provides access to a diverse range of voice identities exhibiting creaky voice, while maintaining consistency in other parameters. We developed a spectrogram-frame level creak representation using CreaPy and finetuned FreeVC,\na one-shot voice conversion tool, by conditioning the speaker embedding and the self-supervised audio representation with the creak representation. An integrated plotting feature allows users to visualize and manipulate portions of speech for precise adjustments of creaky phonation levels. Beyond research, CreakVC has potential applications in voice-interactive systems and multimedia production."},

This often results in lengthy waiting periods for students to receive in-person consultations with counselors, and suboptimal treatment due to counselors’ unmanageable workloads. This paper proposes the advancement of a mental health dialogue system named NYCUKA to support both students and counselors. NYCUKA provides immediate aid by acting as an active listener to encourage students to share more about themselves during the waiting period. NYCUKA focuses primarily on the traditional Chinese language. All components are thoughtfully developed to ensure reliability aspect leading to safe communication. Conversation histories are stored in the database and analyzed using an advanced continual reasoning prompt for large language models. Conversation histories and analyses are displayed on the counselor dashboard to monitor\nstudents’ mental health effectively."},

The SSMT pipeline also has components like a stress classifier that captures the stress in the source speech and allows it to be utilized during speech generation.

In spite of this simple structure, we were able to produce “How are you?” with this model and a single actuator. The second model, VTM-UT-D11, is based on the model that Umeda and Teranishi made. Eleven actuators control the positions of ten plastic bars in the main vocal tract and the velopharyngeal opening to adjust the vocal-tract configuration dynamically. Not only the English phrase “How are you?” but also Japanese phrase for “Good morning” were successfully produced. Finally, the third model, VTM-UT-D6, was newly designed.

It is characterized by behavioral changes and decreased cognitive function, while individuals can still maintain their independence. Early detection of MCI is critical, as it allows for timely intervention, enrichment of clinical trial cohorts, and the development of therapeutic approaches. Recently, language markers have been shown to be a promising approach to identifying MCI in a non-intrusive, affordable, and accessible fashion. In the InterSpeech 2024 TAUKADIAL Challenge, we study language markers from spontaneous speech in English and Chinese and use the bilingual language markers to identify MCI cases and predict the Mini-Mental Status Examination (MMSE) scores. Our proposed framework combines the power from 1) feature extraction of a comprehensive set of bilingual acoustic features, and semantic and syntactic features from language models; 2) careful treatment of model complexity for small sample size; 3) consideration of imbalanced demographic structure, potential outlier removal, and a multi-task treatment that uses the prediction of clinical classification as prior for MMSE prediction. The proposed approach delivers an average of 78.2% Balanced Accuracy in MCI detection and an averaged RMSE of 2.705 in predicting MMSE.

Since traditional diagnostic methods are often costly and result in delayed diagnoses, many efforts have been made to propose automatic detection approaches. However, most methods focus on monolingual cases, limiting the scalability of their models to individuals speaking different languages. To understand the common characteristics of people with MCI speaking different languages, we propose a multilingual MCI detection model using multimodal approaches that analyze both acoustic and linguistic features. It outperforms existing machine learning models by identifying universal MCI indicators across languages. Particularly, we find that speech duration and pauses are crucial in detecting MCI in multilingual settings.

Moreover, due to inter-subject distribution shifts in EEGs, most existing models perform well only on specific subjects. To address these issues, we propose a new ASAD model. EEG graphs are constructed based on brain effective connectivity, and then mapped into embedding spaces by a graph neural network architecture. Meanwhile, feature disentanglement combined with correlation alignment is utilized to learn subject-invariant EEG patterns relevant to ASAD tasks.

To address this, we present SyncVSR, an end-to-end learning framework that leverages quantized audio for frame-level crossmodal supervision. By integrating a projection layer that synchronizes visual representation with acoustic data, our encoder learns to generate discrete audio tokens from a video sequence in a non-autoregressive manner. SyncVSR shows versatility across tasks, languages, and modalities at the cost of a forward pass. Our empirical evaluations show that it not only achieves state-of-the-art results but also reduces data usage by up to ninefold."},
{"title": "Evaluating a 3-factor listener model for prediction of speech intelligibility to hearing-impaired listeners", "authors": "Mark Huckvale, Gaston Hilkhuysen", "abstract": "A speech intelligibility prediction model for hearing impaired listeners would be useful in the development of better signal enhancement methods and for the fitting of hearing aids. Most current prediction models use only information from a pure-tone audiogram to characterise impaired listeners, although evidence suggests that listeners vary in ways not captured by pure-tone thresholds. In this paper we evaluate a model in which each listener is described by three factors: average pure-tone thresholds, sensitivity to phonetic distortion and sensitivity to word likelihood. We build and evaluate the model using the corpus collected by the second Clarity Prediction Challenge, which contains over 13,000 intelligibility judgments by 31 hearing impaired listeners. We describe how the factors were estimated and test their independence. We show that incorporating the listener-dependent factors into an existing intelligibility metric can improve the accuracy of prediction on held-out test data with a 9.8% relative improvement in prediction error."},

The model employs acoustic embeddings from self-supervised models and considers speech traits of both normal hearing (NH) adults and children, which is a novel method for evaluating speech of children with disorders. It combines phoneme embeddings and two acoustic embeddings from Wav2Vec2.0 models, each trained on the speech of NH adults and children, via multi-head attention. Using a speech corpus of Korean-speaking children with CIs, our model outperforms single-embedding methods in a Pearson correlation coefficient between predicted and expert-rated scores, with a relative improvement of 51%. The results highlight the effectiveness of Wav2Vec2.0 acoustic embeddings and the importance of incorporating both of typical speech patterns of NH adults and children in assessing speech production skills in children with CIs."},

Recent research has not explored the adaptation of state-of-the-art methods to this task, despite its significance.

We compare state-of-the-art architectures trained on an aligned speech-to-pictogram dataset, specially created and released for this study. We conduct an in-depth automatic and human evaluation to analyze their behavior on pictogram translation. The results highlight the cascade approach’s ability to generate relevant translations from everyday read speech, while the end-to-end approach achieves competitive results with challenging acoustic data."},
{"title": "Contrastive Feedback Mechanism for Simultaneous Speech Translation", "authors": "Haotian Tan, Sakriani Sakti", "abstract": "Recent advances in simultaneous speech translation (SST) focus on the decision policies that enable the use of offline-trained ST models for simultaneous inference. These decision policies not only control the quality-latency trade-off in SST but also mitigate the impact of unstable predictions on translation quality by delaying translation for more context or discarding these predictions through stable hypothesis detection. However, these policies often overlook the potential benefits of utilizing unstable predictions. We introduce the contrastive feedback mechanism (CFM) for SST, a novel method that leverages these unstable predictions as feedback to improve translation quality. CFM guides the system to eliminate undesired model behaviors from these predictions through a contrastive objective. The experiments on 3 state-of-the-art decision policies across 8 languages in the MuST-C v1.0 dataset show that CFM effectively improves the performance of SST."},
{"title": "Lightweight Audio Segmentation for Long-form Speech Translation", "authors": "Jaesong Lee, Soyoon Kim, Hanbyul Kim, Joon Son Chung", "abstract": "Speech segmentation is an essential part of speech translation (ST) systems in real-world scenarios. Since most ST models are designed to process speech segments, long-form audio must be partitioned into shorter segments before translation. Recently, data-driven approaches for the speech segmentation task have been developed. Although these approaches improve overall translation quality, a performance gap exists due to a mismatch between the models and ST systems.In addition, the prior works require large self-supervised speech models, which consume significant computational resources.In this work, we propose a segmentation model that achieves better speech translation quality with a small model size. We propose an ASR-with-punctuation task as an effective pre-training strategy for the segmentation model. We also show that proper integration of the speech segmentation model into the underlying ST system is critical to improve overall translation quality at inference time."},

SVCD approximates the weight matrix of the linear layer as a sign matrix and two trainable vectors, preserving higher information capacity at a minor space cost. Additionally, we utilize knowledge distillation to transfer the capability of the original fine-tuned model to the quantized model.

We employ a three-level learning technique that guides the model in focusing on different scopes for the contrastive loss, i.e., task, subgroup, and the errors within subgroups. The experiments on two spoken language understanding datasets and two languages demonstrate that our approach improves internal subgroup representations, thus reducing model bias and enhancing performance."},

We evaluate their performance using the F1 score and a fine-grained taxonomy of ASR-NER errors. Our experiments reveal that the encoder-decoder model outperforms the decoder-only model if the context is short, while the decoder-only model benefits from a long context as it fully exploits all layers of the LLM. Additionally, we obtain a state-of-the-art F1 score of 0.805 on the AISHELL-NER test set by using chain-of-thought NER which first infers long-form ASR transcriptions and then predicts NER labels."},

This study's interest lies in the loss of multilingual performances and lack of specific-semantics training induced by such specialization in close languages without any SLU implication. We also consider SAMU-XLSR's loss of initial cross-lingual abilities due to a separate SLU fine-tuning. Therefore, this paper proposes a dual task learning approach to improve SAMU-XLSR semantic enrichment while considering distant languages for multilingual and language portability experiments."},

Furthermore, by employing model interpretability techniques, we shed light on the factors contributing to the generalisation difficulties of the models. To improve the generalisation, we experiment with two techniques, which improve the results on some, but not all the splits, emphasising the need for new techniques."},

In this study, we propose finding task-specific subnetworks within a multi-task SLU model via neural network pruning. In addition to model compression, we expect that the forgetting of previously trained tasks can be mitigated by updating only a task-specific subnetwork. We conduct experiments on top of the state-of-the-art multi-task SLU model ``UniverSLU'', trained for several tasks such as emotion recognition (ER), intent classification (IC), and automatic speech recognition (ASR). We show that pruned models were successful in adapting to additional ASR or IC data with minimal performance degradation on previously trained tasks."},

The problem commonly arises in real-world scenarios, such as identifying the intents of speeches from individuals with a specific speech disorder using those of other disorders. However, existing data selection methods for utilizing the source instances encounter two main challenges: they cannot consider the diversities of source domains, and their hard selection schemes may ignore helpful source instances if the given information of the target domain is insufficient. In this work, we propose DOREME, a domain-aware data selection method for accurate speech classification on a target domain. The key idea is to softly select source instances by dynamically assigning importance scores to each instance based on two similarities: instance-scores and domain-scores. Various experiments show that DOREME achieves the best classification accuracy."},

The proposed method employs a dual-pipeline with low-rank adaptation (LoRA). It maintains two data flow pipelines—one for existing languages and another for new languages. The primary pipeline follows the standard flow through the pre-trained parameters of mASR, while the secondary pipeline additionally utilizes language-specific parameters represented by LoRA and a separate output decoder module. Importantly, the proposed approach minimizes the performance degradation of existing languages and enables a language-agnostic operation mode, facilitated by a decoder selection strategy. We validate the effectiveness of the proposed method by extending the pre-trained Whisper model to 19 new languages from the FLEURS dataset."},

Conventional learning criteria directly use original captions that contain not only speaking-style factor terms but also syntax words, which disturbs learning speaking-style information. To solve this problem, we introduce factor-conditioned captioning (FCC), which first outputs a phrase representing speaking-style factors (e.g., gender, pitch, etc.), and then generates a caption to ensure the model explicitly learns speaking-style factors. We also propose greedy-then-sampling (GtS) decoding, which first predicts speaking-style factors deterministically to guarantee semantic accuracy, and then generates a caption based on factor-conditioned sampling to ensure diversity. Experiments show that FCC outperforms the original caption-based training, and with GtS, it generates more diverse captions while keeping style prediction performance."},

Their effectiveness in addressing domain-shift speech, notably in the context of emotional speech, has remained largely unexplored in the existing works. In this study, a modality translation model is proposed to align speech and text modalities based on a shared space for speech-to-text translation, and aims to harness such a shared representation to address the challenge of emotional speech recognition.

On source domains, IFNT demonstrated statistically significant accuracy im- provements, achieving a relative enhancement of 1.2% to 2.8% in baseline accuracy compared to the neural Transducer. On out-of-domain datasets, IFNT shows relative WER(CER) improvements of up to 30.2% over the standard neural Transducer with shallow fusion, and relative WER(CER) reductions ranging from 1.1% to 2.8% on test sets compared to the FNT model."},

A standard separation method for multi-talker DSR is a statistical multichannel method called guided source separation (GSS).

To overcome this limitation, we introduce and train a neural inference model in a weakly-supervised manner, employing the objective function of a statistical separation method. This training requires only multichannel mixtures and their temporal annotations of speaker activities. In contrast to GSS, the trained model can jointly separate and diarize speech mixtures without any auxiliary information. The experiments with the AMI corpus show that our method outperforms GSS with oracle diarization results regarding word error rates. The code is available online."},

With SDNC, our system does not require an extra non-neural clustering method to assign speaker labels, thus allowing the entire system to be based on neural networks. Experimental results on the AMI meeting dataset demonstrate that SDNC outperforms spectral clustering (SC) by a 19% relative diarisation error rate (DER) reduction on the AMI Eval set.

In RAS, models are trained so that sources predicted from a mixture at an input channel can be mapped to reconstruct a mixture at a target channel.  However, stable unsupervised training has so far only been achieved in over-determined source-channel conditions, leaving the key determined case unsolved. This work proposes enhanced RAS (ERAS) for solving this problem. Through qualitative analysis, we found that stable training can be achieved by leveraging the loss term to alleviate the frequency-permutation problem. Separation performance is also boosted by adding a novel loss term where separated signals mapped back to their own input mixture are used as pseudo-targets for the signals separated from other channels and mapped to the same channel. Experimental results demonstrate high stability and performance of ERAS."},

We propose pitch-based and onset-based training to resolve permutation ambiguity, assigning speakers by their pitch frequencies and onset times, respectively. This approach offers a more explainable training strategy than PIT.

{"title": "Boosting the Transferability of Adversarial Examples with Gradient-Aligned Ensemble Attack for Speaker Recognition", "authors": "Zhuhai Li, Jie Zhang, Wu Guo, Haochen Wu", "abstract": "In the black-box attack for speaker recognition systems, the adversarial examples can exhibit better transferability for unseen victim system if they can consistently spoof an ensemble of substitute models. In this work, we propose a gradient-aligned ensemble attack method to find the optimal gradient direction to update the adversarial example using a set of substitute models. Specifically, we first calculate the overfitting-reduced gradient for each substitute model by randomly masking some regions of the input acoustic features. Then we obtain the weight of the gradient for each substitute model based on the consistency of its gradient with respect to others. The final update gradient is calculated by the weighted sum of the gradients over all substitute models. Experimental results on the VoxCeleb dataset verify the effectiveness of the proposed approach for the speaker identification and speaker verification tasks."},
{"title": "Textual-Driven Adversarial Purification for Speaker Verification", "authors": "Sizhou Chen, Yibo Bai, Jiadi Yao, Xiao-Lei Zhang, Xuelong Li", "abstract": "Adversarial attacks introduce subtle perturbations to audio signals for causing automatic speaker verification (ASV) systems to make mistakes. To address this challenge, adversarial purification techniques have emerged, where diffusion models have been proven effective. However, the latest development with the diffusion models caused a negative effect that the audio generation quality is not high enough. Moreover, these approaches tend to focus solely on audio features, while often neglecting textual information. To overcome these limitations, we propose a textual-driven adversarial purification (TDAP) framework, which integrates diffusion models with pretrained large audio language models for comprehensive defense. TDAP employs textual data extracted from audio to guide the diffusion-based purification process. Extensive experimental results show that TDAP significantly enhances the defense robustness against adversarial attacks."},

In this paper, we propose a neural codec-based adversarial sample detection method for ASV. The approach leverages the codec's ability to discard redundant perturbations and retain essential information. Specifically, we distinguish between genuine and adversarial samples by comparing ASV score differences between original and re-synthesized audio (by codec models). This comprehensive study explores all open-source neural codecs and their variant models for experiments. The Descript-audio-codec model stands out by delivering the highest detection rate among 15 neural codecs and surpassing seven prior state-of-the-art (SOTA) detection methods. Note that, our single-model method even outperforms a SOTA ensemble method by a large margin."},

Targeted black-box attacks emerge as the most formidable threat, proving incredibly challenging to counteract. However, existing defenses exhibit limitations when applied in real-world scenarios. We propose VoiceDefense - a novel adversarial sample detection method that slices an audio sample into multiple segments and captures their local audio features with segment-specific ASV scores. These scores present distributions that vary distinctly between genuine and adversarial samples, which VoiceDefense leverages for detection. VoiceDefense outperforms the state of the art with a best AUC of 0.9624 and is consistently effective against various attacks and perturbation budgets, all while maintaining remarkably low computational overhead."},

The copy-synthesis method offers a simple yet effective solution to this problem. However, the limitation of this method is that it only utilizes the artifacts generated by vocoders, neglecting those from acoustic models. This paper aims to locate the artifacts introduced by the acoustic models of Text-to-Speech (TTS) and Voice Conversion (VC) algorithms, and optimize the copy-synthesis pipeline. The proposed rhythm and speaker perturbation modules successfully boost anti-spoofing models to leverage the artifacts introduced by acoustic models, thereby enhancing their generalization ability when facing various TTS and VC algorithms."},
{"title": "Spoofing Speech Detection by Modeling Local Spectro-Temporal and Long-term Dependency", "authors": "Haochen Wu, Wu Guo, Zhentao Zhang, Wenting Zhao, Shengyu Peng, Jie Zhang", "abstract": "In this work, a dual-branch network is proposed to exploit both local and global information of utterances for spoofing speech detection (SSD). The local artifacts of spoofing speech can reside in specific temporal or spectral regions, which are the primary objectives for SSD systems. We propose a spectro-temporal graph attention network to jointly capture the temporal and spectral differences of the spoofing speech. It is different from existing methods that the proposed method exploits the cross attention mechanism to bridge the spectro-temporal dependency. As the global artifacts can also provide complimentary information for SSD, we use a BiLSTM-based branch to modeling temporal long-term discriminative clues. These two branches are then separately optimized with the weighted cross-entropy loss, and the scores are fused at equal weights. Results  on three benchmark datasets (i.e., ASVspoof 2019, 2021 LA and 2021 DF) reveal the superiority of the proposed method over advanced systems."},

It aims to determine what spoofed when, which includes not only locating spoof regions but also clustering them according to different spoofing methods. As a pioneering study in spoof diarization, we focus on defining the task, establishing evaluation metrics, and proposing a bench- mark model, namely the Countermeasure-Condition Clustering (3C) model. Utilizing this model, we first explore how to effectively train countermeasures to support spoof diarization using three labeling schemes. We then utilize spoof localization predictions to enhance the diarization performance. This first study reveals the high complexity of the task, even in restricted scenarios where only a single speaker per audio file and an oracle number of spoofing methods are considered.

Despite the recent advances in speaker verification based on deep neural networks, this technology is still susceptible to various malicious attacks, so that some kind of countermeasures are needed. While an increasing number of anti-spoofing techniques can be found in the literature, the combination of multiple models, or ensemble models, still proves to be one of the best approaches. However, current iterations often rely on fixed weight assignments, potentially neglecting the unique strengths of each individual model. In response, we propose a novel ensembling model, an adaptive neural network-based approach that dynamically adjusts weights based on input utterances. Our experimental findings show that this approach outperforms traditional weighted score averaging techniques, showcasing its ability to adapt to diverse audio characteristics effectively."},

Prior sociolinguistic work has shown that factors such as expressing group identity and solidarity, performing affective function, and reflecting shared experiences are related to CSW prevalence in multilingual speech. We build on prior studies by asking: is the expression of empathy a motivation for CSW in speech? To begin to answer this question, we examine several multilingual speech corpora representing diverse language families and apply recent modeling advances in the study of empathetic monolingual speech. We find a generally stronger positive relationship of spoken CSW with the lexical correlates of empathy than with acoustic-prosodic ones, which holds across three language pairs. Our work is a first step toward establishing a motivation for CSW that has thus far mainly been studied qualitatively."},

Triggers for this may include experiences, such as military combat, natural disasters, or sexual abuse, having a great influence on the mental wellbeing. Due to the severity of this condition, early detection and professional treatment is crucial. For this reason, previous research explored prediction models for recognising PTSD at an early stage. However, when these models are transferred from research to real-world applications, they face heterogeneous environments (e.g., different recording settings, various dialects or languages). To analyse this effect, we develop a speech-based PTSD recognition model and subsequently analyse its cross-corpus and cross-linguistic performance. Our experiments indicate that there are cross-cultural factors incluencing PTSD and leading to a best area under the ROC curve (AUC) of 70.1% evaluated on the cross-corpus."},

Humans can regulate vocal intensity over a wide sound pressure level (SPL) range  and therefore speech can be categorized into different vocal intensity categories. Recent machine learning experiments have studied classification of vocal intensity category from speech signals which have been recorded without SPL information and which are represented on arbitrary amplitude scales. By fine-tuning four pre-trained models (wav2vec2-BASE, wav2vec2-LARGE, HuBERT, audio speech transformers), this paper studies classification of speech into four intensity categories (soft, normal, loud, very loud), when speech is presented on such arbitrary amplitude scale. The fine-tuned model embeddings showed absolute improvements of 5% and 10-12% in accuracy compared to baselines for the target intensity category label and the SPL-based intensity category label, respectively."},

Traditionally, CS evaluations were conducted manually or with classical machine learning algorithms; however, advancements in deep learning have led to automated systems that evaluate CS using speech and text analyses. Previous studies have shown the text approach to be more accurate but relies on an external ASR for transcription. This study introduces a cross-transfer knowledge technique, distilling knowledge from the BERT model into speech encoders like Wav2Vec2, WavLM, and Whisper. By enriching these encoders with BERT’s linguistic information, we improve speech analysis performance and eliminate the need for an ASR. In evaluations on a dataset of customer opinions, our methods achieve over 92\\% accuracy in identifying CS categories, providing a faster and cost-effective solution compared to traditional text approaches."},

Eight friends and two foil speakers were recorded speaking and singing to investigate the effects of speaker familiarity and singing in speaker identification tasks. The stimuli were used to create a listening test completed by close social network speakers, members of the wider social network, and general lay listeners. The study aimed to explore the impact of familiarity on an individual’s ability to recognise speakers when presented with spoken and sung stimuli. The results revealed that the listeners within the close social network were the most successful in the listening test. Overall, listeners performed best when both samples were spoken, however, those in the close social network were less affected by the use of sung samples, and scored higher, compared to those outside the close social network."},
{"title": "Exploring the anatomy of articulation rate in spontaneous English speech: relationships between utterance length effects and social factors", "authors": "James Tanner, Morgan Sonderegger, Jane Stuart-Smith, Tyler Kendall, Jeff Mielke, Robin Dodsworth, Erik Thomas", "abstract": "Speech rate has been shown to vary across social categories such as gender, age, and dialect, while also being conditioned by properties of speech planning. The effect of utterance length, where speech rate is faster and less variable for longer utterances, has also been shown to reduce the role of social factors once it has been accounted for, leaving unclear the relationship between social factors and speech production in conditioning speech rate. Through modelling of speech rate across 13 English speech corpora, it is found that utterance length has the largest effect on speech rate, though this effect itself varies little across corpora and speakers. While age and gender also modulate speech rate, their effects are much smaller in magnitude. These findings suggest utterance length effects may be conditioned by articulatory and perceptual constraints, and that social influences on speech rate should be interpreted in the broader context of how speech rate variation is structured."},

The prosodic features of the dialogues of attentive listening are analyzed to describe how the prosody of Japanese backchannels is affected by the preceding interlocutor’s utterance. We adopt a support vector regression (SVR) to model the relationships between the prosodic features of backchannels and those of the preceding utterances. As a result, we found an interrelationship between the different types of features; in particular, the F0 of backchannels is highly correlated with the power of the preceding utterance. The regression analyses show that the combination of prosodic features of the preceding utterances achieves good prediction of both the F0 and power of backchannels. The findings of this study can be applied to the automatic generation of backchannels for spoken dialogue systems to show empathy and facilitate user’s speech."},
{"title": "Modelled Multivariate Overlap: A method for measuring vowel merger", "authors": "Irene Smith, Morgan Sonderegger, The Spade Consortium", "abstract": "This paper introduces a novel method for quantifying vowel overlap. There is a tension in previous work between using multivariate measures, such as those derived from empirical distri- butions, and the ability to control for unbalanced data and extraneous factors, as is possible when using fitted model parameters. The method presented here resolves this tension by jointly modelling all acoustic dimensions of interest and by simulating distributions from the model to compute a measure of vowel overlap. An additional benefit of this method is that computation of uncertainty becomes straightforward. We evaluate this method on corpus speech data targeting the PIN-PEN merger in four dialects of English and find that using modelled distributions to calculate Bhattacharyya affinity substantially improves results compared to empirical distributions, while the difference between multivariate and univariate modelling is subtle."},

By examining 24 linguistic features of Bern and Zurich German, including nine vowels and 15 consonants in single-word utterances, we aim to fill a research gap that has been previously overlooked, despite suggestions of importance. In an online perception study, we gathered evaluations from three distinct groups of raters (N = 46) from Bern, Zurich, and Hessen, Germany, across six categories from aesthetic dimensions to stereotypical dialect attributions. The findings reveal that rater origin determines the levels of importance on evaluation categories and that certain linguistic features can be identified that are closely linked with specific perceptions (e.g., stupid or arrogant), which may foster negative biases against dialect speakers."},

This ensemble approach demonstrates improved generalizability within short 1-second decision windows, incorporating subtle distinctions in spatial features extracted by the networks from the EEG.

Studies have revealed that such intra-speaker trial-to-trial variability is connected to speech perception and is actively regulated during speech production. However, the relevant parameters in the variability that are under active regulation remain largely unclear. This study contributes to the discussion by examining the distributional properties of intra-speaker variability. Following up on a study that showed formants on hundreds of repetitions of the same word, measured at different points along the trajectory, are all normally distributed, we ask if those normal distributions correspond, i.e. whether a particular repetition would hold a stable position in the distributions across measurement points. Our analysis of 300 repetitions of /i, oU/ showed that strong correspondence typically spans one to two measurement points, and the strength of correspondence is phonemedependent and position sensitive."},

Furthermore, we build a channel attention convolutional neural network (CA-CNN) as a reference model for ASA, that serves as a competitive benchmark for future studies."},

In recent years, deep learning methods have been proposed for speech synthesis which have achieved significant progress towards human-like speech generation.

We consider a deep learning-based sequence-to-sequence baseline. We improve upon this network using a novel approach of labelaware contrastive learning using framewise phoneme alignment to learn better representations of the articulatory trajectories. With this approach, we obtain a relative improvement in Word Error Rate (WER) of 5.8% over the baseline.

We first present a deep labeling strategy for the RT-MRI video using a vision-only segmentation approach. We then introduce a multimodal algorithm using audio to improve segmentation of vocal articulators. Together, we set a new benchmark for vocal tract modeling in MRI video segmentation and use this to release labels for a 75-speaker RT-MRI dataset, increasing the amount of labeled public RT-MRI data of the vocal tract by over a factor of 9.

However, Mean Square Error (MSE) based diffusion models focus on the pixel error between reference and generated UTI data, inherently omitting changes in tongue movements. This leads to the discrepancy in tongue trajectory between reference and generated UTI data. To address this issue, this paper presents an Optical Flow Guided tongue trajectory generation method for training the diffusionbased AAI model.  The optical flow method calculates the displacement information of the tongue contours in consecutive frames, enabling the tongue trajectory similarity between reference and generated UTI data to be used as an additional constraint for Diffusion Model network optimization. Experimental results show that our proposed diffusionbased AAI system with additional tongue trajectory constraint outperformed the baseline system across various evaluation metrics."},

We investigate whether using electroencephalography (EEG) signals from articulated speech can be used to improve imagined speech decoding in two ways: we investigate whether articulated speech EEG signals can be used to predict the end point of the imagined speech and use the articulated speech EEG as extra training data for speaker-independent imagined vowel classification. Our results show that using EEG data from articulated speech did not improve classification of vowels in imagined speech, probably due to high variability in EEG signals amongst speakers."},

We investigate such a system on a real low-resource language, Yoruba, and propose a Yoruba-to-English speech translation model that leverages pretrained components in order to be able to learn in the low-resource regime. To limit overfitting, we find that it is essential to use a decoding scheme that produces diverse image captions for training.

Previous work in the field of simultaneous machine translation only implemented greedy decoding. We present a beam-search realization that handles all of the above, providing guidance through the minefield of challenges. Our approach increases the BLEU score by 1 point compared to greedy search, reduces the CPU time by up to 40% and character flicker rate by 20+% compared to a baseline heuristic that just retranslates input repeatedly."},

Most parameter-efficient fine-tuning (PEFT) methods only train additional modules to effectively reduce the number of trainable parameters. Nevertheless, the increase in trainable parameters caused by the PEFT method remains non-negligible in multilingual speech translation settings. In this paper, we first propose the parameter-sharing adapter, which reduces parameters by 7/8 compared to regular adapters, with only approximately 0.7% performance decrease. For the balance between model parameter quantity and performance, we present a neural network search (NAS) based model. Experimental results revealed that the performance of adapter is closest to fine-tuning, while LoRA exhibits the poorest performance."},

The Open Whisper-style Speech Model (OWSM) is an initial step towards reproducing OpenAI Whisper using public data and open-source toolkits.

This work aims to improve the performance and efficiency of OWSM without additional data. We present a series of E-Branchformer-based models named OWSM v3.1, ranging from 100M to 1B parameters. OWSM v3.1 outperforms its predecessor, OWSM v3, in most evaluation benchmarks, while showing an improved inference speed of up to 25%. We further reveal the emergent ability of OWSM v3.1 in zero-shot contextual biasing speech recognition. We also provide a model trained on a subset of data with low license restrictions. We will publicly release the code, pre-trained models, and training logs.1"},
{"title": "Adding User Feedback To Enhance CB-Whisper", "authors": "Raul Monteiro", "abstract": "Contextual biasing has been demonstrated to be effective in improving Whisper recall for named entities or domain-specific words. In a recent work, CB-Whisper takes an additional step and integrates a classifier for open-vocabulary keyword-spotting (OV-KWS) to retrieve keywords from an external database to form a restricted biasing list. Heavy dependence on text-to-speech (TTS) models for generating the speech for the keywords makes the system prone to the drawbacks of using TTS models to generate speech for graphemes with non-trivial phonetic transcriptions. This work proposes an extension to CB-Whisper that leverages user feedback to extend the database of keywords with audio extracted from natural speech. We experiment with different learning strategies for the OV-KWS classifier to assess its domain generalization capabilities for TTS-generated or natural-speech keyword audios and unseen languages."},

A non-trainable pronunciation model then maps sequences of attributes into spoken keywords in a multilingual setting. Experiments on the Multilingual Spoken Words Corpus show comparable performances to character- and phoneme-based SKR in seen languages. The inclusion of domain adversarial training (DAT) improves the proposed framework, outperforming both character- and phoneme-based SKR approaches with 13.73% and 17.22% relative word error rate (WER) reduction in seen languages, and achieves 32.14% and 19.92% WER reduction for unseen languages in zero-shot settings."},

While much research has focused on noisy KWS, less attention has been paid to multi-talker mixed speech scenarios. Unlike the usual cocktail party problem where multi-talker speech is separated using speaker clues, the key challenge here is to extract the target speech for KWS based on text clues. To address it, this paper proposes a novel Text-aware Permutation Determinization Training method for multi-talker KWS with a clue-based Speech Separation front-end (TPDT-SS). Our research highlights the critical role of SS front-ends and shows that incorporating keyword-specific clues into these models can greatly enhance the effectiveness. TPDT-SS shows remarkable success in addressing permutation problems in mixed keyword speech, thereby greatly boosting the performance of the backend. Additionally, fine-tuning our system on unseen mixed speech results in further performance improvement."},

For every input frame, the proposed method finds the optimal alignment ending at the frame using connectionist temporal classification (CTC) and aggregates the frame-level acoustic embedding (AE) to obtain higher-level (i.e., character, word, or phrase) AE that aligns with the text embedding (TE) of the target keyword text. After that, we calculate the similarity of the aggregated AE and the TE. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first attempt to dynamically align the audio and the keyword text on-the-fly to attain the joint audio-text embedding for KWS.  Despite operating in a streaming fashion, our approach achieves competitive performance on the LibriPhrase dataset compared to the non-streaming methods with a mere 155K model parameters and a decoding algorithm with time complexity O(U), where U is the length of the target keyword at inference time."},

Primarily using goodness-of-pronunciation as an acoustic feature, we tailor mixup designs to suit pronunciation assessment. Further, we integrate fine-grained error-rate features by comparing speech recognition results with the original answer phonemes, giving direct hints for mispronunciation. Effective mixing of the acoustic features notably enhances overall scoring performances on the speechocean762 dataset, and detailed analysis highlights our potential to predict unseen distortions."},

Due to the unpredictable nature of non-native speakers’ pronunciation errors and limited training datasets, modelling all mispronunciations becomes impractical. Additionally, phoneme-level MDD approaches provide limited diagnostic information. In our proposed approach, we detect phonological features, breaking down phoneme production into elementary components related to the articulatory system, offering more informative feedback to learners.

A recent recasting of the Viterbi algorithm, SIEVE, eliminates the path length factor from space complexity, but with a significant practical runtime overhead. In this paper, we develop a variant of SIEVE that lessens this runtime overhead via beam search, retains the decoding quality of standard beam search, and waives its linearly growing memory bottleneck. This space-complexity reduction is orthogonal to decoding quality and complementary to memory savings in model representation and training."},

However, a notable limitation is the slow inference caused by the multi-step reverse diffusion. Therefore, we propose FastVoiceGrad, a novel one-step diffusion-based VC that reduces the number of iterations from dozens to one while inheriting the high VC performance of the multi-step diffusion-based VC. We obtain the model using adversarial conditional diffusion distillation (ACDD), leveraging the ability of generative adversarial networks and diffusion models while reconsidering the initial states in sampling. Evaluations of one-shot any-to-any VC demonstrate that FastVoiceGrad achieves VC performance superior to or comparable to that of previous multi-step diffusion-based VC while enhancing the inference speed."},
{"title": "Neural Codec Language Models for Disentangled and Textless Voice Conversion", "authors": "Alan Baade, Puyuan Peng, David Harwath", "abstract": "We introduce a method for textless any-to-any voice conversion based on the recent progress in speech synthesis driven by neural codec language models. To disentangle the speaker and linguistic information, we adapt a speaker normalizing procedure for discrete semantic units, and then generate with an autoregressive language model for greatly improved diversity. We further improve the similarity of the output audio to the target speaker's voice by leveraging classifier free guidance. We evaluate our techniques against current text to speech synthesis and voice conversion systems and compare the effectiveness of different neural codec language model pipelines. We demonstrate state-of-the-art results in accent disentanglement and speaker similarity for voice conversion with significantly less compute than existing codec language models such as VALL-E."},
{"title": "Fine-Grained and Interpretable Neural Speech Editing", "authors": "Max Morrison, Cameron Churchwell, Nathan Pruyne, Bryan Pardo", "abstract": "Fine-grained editing of speech attributes - such as prosody (i.e., the pitch, loudness, and phoneme durations), pronunciation, speaker identity, and formants - is useful for fine-tuning and fixing imperfections in human and AI-generated speech recordings for creation of podcasts, film dialogue, and video game dialogue. Existing speech synthesis systems use representations that entangle two or more of these attributes, prohibiting their use in fine-grained, disentangled editing. In this paper, we demonstrate the first disentangled and interpretable representation of speech with comparable subjective and objective vocoding reconstruction accuracy to Mel spectrograms. Our interpretable representation, combined with our proposed data augmentation method, enables training an existing neural vocoder to perform fast, accurate, and high-quality editing of pitch, duration, volume, timbral correlates of volume, pronunciation, speaker identity, and spectral balance."},

Traditional voice conversion methods focus on single-channel waveforms, ignoring the stereo listening experience inherent in human hearing. Our baseline approach addresses this gap by integrating blind source separation (BSS), voice conversion (VC), and spatial mixing to handle multi-channel waveforms. Through experimental evaluations, we organize and identify the key challenges inherent in this task, such as maintaining audio quality and accurately preserving spatial information. Our results highlight the fundamental difficulties in balancing these aspects, providing a benchmark for future research in spatial voice conversion. The proposed method's code is publicly available to encourage further exploration in this domain."},
{"title": "SDAEC: Signal Decoupling for Advancing Acoustic Echo Cancellation", "authors": "Fei Zhao, Jinjiang Liu, Xueliang Zhang", "abstract": "In deep learning-based acoustic echo cancellation methods, neural networks implicitly learn echo paths to cancel echoes. However, under low signal-to-echo ratio conditions, the substantial energy discrepancy between the microphone signal and the reference signal impedes the network's ability, resulting in poor performance. In this study, we propose a Signal Decoupling-based monaural Acoustic Echo Cancellation method called SDAEC. Specifically, we model the energy of the reference signal and the microphone signal to obtain an energy scaling factor. The reference signal is then multiplied by this energy scaling factor before being fed into the subsequent echo cancellation network. This approach reduces the difficulty of the subsequent echo cancellation step, thereby improving the overall cancellation performance. Experimental results demonstrate that the proposed method enhances the performance of multiple baseline models."},

Numerous deep-learning models have been developed for the echo cancellation task and achieved great progress by incorporating additional features; however, the majority of these models overlook the characteristics of different features and simply merge them along the channel dimension. In this paper, we proposed a multi-scale asymmetric dual-path convolution recurrent network (MSA-DPCRN) consisting of two asymmetric encoding paths to extract spectrum and relevant features from the input reference and microphone signals. Moreover, we propose a frequency-wise attentional feature fusion (AFF) method to fuse the two features while maintaining the original dynamic range. The experiments validate the effectiveness of each component in MSA-DPCRN and indicate that our model outperforms the AEC challenge baseline in terms of the Echo-MOS metrics."},

Despite some progress over the past few decades, there is a dearth of literature on efficient algorithms. This paper introduces a binarized feature-matching (BFM) framework, encompassing a set of feature extraction methods, which are compared with traditional methods such as the GCC-Phat-based method, the adaptive-filter-based method, and popular methods published in WebRTC projects, in terms of both complexity and performance. The computational loads of the BFM methods are significantly lower, and a hybrid BFM method further enhances performance in terms of convergence speed and robustness. This method, characterized by its low complexity, benefits both traditional and NN-based AEC."},
{"title": "Efficient Joint Bemforming and Acoustic Echo Cancellation Structure for Conference Call Scenarios", "authors": "Ofer Schwartz, Sharon Gannot", "abstract": "We propose an efficient scheme for combining beamformer (BF) and acoustic echo cancellation (AEC). We focus on conference call scenarios characterized by stationary background noise and multiple speakers who alternate frequently. Furthermore, aiming at low-resource devices, a common strategy is to apply a single AEC at the output of the BF rather than applying multiple AECs to each microphone signal. The main drawback of such a structure is the frequent change of the echo path due to the BF adaptation. To circumvent this problem, it is proposed to apply a single-channel pre-filter to the far-end signal, encompassing the BF weights and the relative acoustic responses between the reference microphone and all other microphones w.r.t. the echo loudspeaker. As a result, the AEC block becomes indifferent to the changes in the BF weights. The proposed scheme is evaluated using real recordings and was found advantageous over standard combined AEC-BF schemes in terms of speed of convergence."},
{"title": "Interference Aware Training Target for DNN based joint Acoustic Echo Cancellation and Noise Suppression", "authors": "Vahid Khanagha, Dimitris Koutsaidis, Kaustubh Kalgaonkar, Sriram Srinivasan", "abstract": "Despite remarkable performance of Deep Learning based Acoustic Echo Cancellation (AEC) systems, effective handling of double-talk scenarios remains a challenge. During double-talk the speech signal from the far-end talker overlaps with the target near-end speech and results in degraded performance in form of near-end speech deletions or audible echo residuals shadowing the voice of target speaker.  This paper introduces an approach to reduce the shadowing effect through altering the ground truth used for model training such that the model can effectively clean up spectral components where the interference is stronger than the target speech. The alteration is accomplished leveraging the availability of interference signal during training data generation by masking spectral components of the ground truth where target speech is significantly weaker than the interference. Large scale subjective evaluation trials show that human listeners prefer the outputs generated by the new approach."},

Ali Basha Shaik", "abstract": "Robust acoustic echo cancellation (AEC) is essential for voice enabled smart devices. Multi-channel signals are used in AEC along with beamformer (BF) for better residual echo suppression (RES). In this work, we introduce a deep neural network (DNN) based novel unified framework for multi-microphone AEC (MMAEC) and RES under adverse signal-to-echo (SER) conditions. We propose the use of deep-MVDR which uses deep steering vector and deep power spectral density (Deep PSD) estimator to conceptually implement minimum variance distortionless beamformer. We also introduce additional novelty in our framework by jointly training the MMAEC and deep-MVDR modules. Both of these methods give consistent significant improvement in ERLE which is further enriched by the incorporation of playback reconstruction loss. Our system outperforms competitive baselines while being robust in adverse real-world conditions such as very low input SER, dominant far-end sources, and moving near-end speech sources."},

Previous studies advanced OSAHS evaluation through machine learning-based systems trained on sleep snoring or speech signal datasets. However, constructing datasets for training a precise and rapid OSAHS evaluation system poses a challenge, since 1) it is time-consuming to collect sleep snores and 2) the speech signal is limited in reflecting upper airway obstruction. In this paper, we propose a new snoring dataset for OSAHS evaluation, named SimuSOE, in which a novel and time-effective snoring collection method is introduced for tackling the above problems. In particular, we adopt simulated snoring which is a type of snore intentionally emitted by patients to replace natural snoring. Experimental results indicate that the simulated snoring signal during wakefulness can serve as an effective feature in OSAHS preliminary screening."},

Schuller", "abstract": "Phonocardiogram classification methods using deep neural networks have been widely applied to the early detection of cardiovascular diseases recently. Despite their excellent recognition rate, the sizeable computational complexity limits their further development. Nowadays, knowledge distillation (KD) is an established paradigm for model compression. While current research on multi-teacher KD has shown potential to impart more comprehensive knowledge to the student than single-teacher KD, this approach is not suitable for all scenarios. This paper proposes a novel KD strategy to realise an adaptive multi-teacher instruction mechanism. We design a teacher selection strategy called voting network to tell the contribution of different teachers on each distillation points, so that the student can choose the useful information and renounce the redundant one. An evaluation demonstrates that our method reaches excellent accuracy (92.8%) while maintaining a low computational complexity (0.7M)."},

We focus on classifying the identity of northern grey gibbons (Hylobates funereus) from their calls with probing and layer-wise analysis of state-of-the-art SSL speech models compared to pre-trained bird species classifiers and audio taggers. By testing the reliance of said models on background noise and timewise information, as well as performance variations across layers, we propose a new understanding of the mechanisms underlying speech models efficacy as bioacoustic tools."},

This paper presents the Dialect Dominated Dataset of Bird Vocalisation (D3BV), the first cross-corpus dataset that focuses on dialects in bird vocalisations. The D3BV comprises more than 25 hours of audio recordings from 10 bird species distributed across three distinct regions in the contiguous United States (CONUS).

Leveraging an automated manipulation pipeline, a dataset named FakeSound for deepfake general audio detection is proposed, and samples can be viewed on website https://FakeSoundData.github.io. The average binary accuracy of humans on all test sets is consistently below 0.6, which indicates the difficulty humans face in discerning deepfake audio and affirms the efficacy of the FakeSound dataset.

However, few works reported satisfactory results of pre-trained models for the machine anomalous sound detection (ASD) task. This may be caused by the inconsistency of the pre-trained model and the inductive bias of machine audio, resulting in inconsistency in data and architecture. Thus, we propose AnoPatch which utilizes a ViT backbone pre-trained on AudioSet and fine-tunes it on machine audio. It is believed that machine audio is more related to audio datasets than speech datasets, and modeling it from patch level suits the sparsity of machine audio. As a result, AnoPatch showcases state-of-the-art (SOTA) performances on the DCASE 2020 ASD dataset and the DCASE 2023 ASD dataset. We also compare multiple pre-trained models and empirically demonstrate that better consistency yields considerable improvement."},

EEND-vector-clustering method mitigates this by combining local EEND with global clustering of speaker embeddings from local windows, but this requires an additional speaker embedding framework alongside the EEND module. In this paper, we propose a novel framework applying EEND both locally and globally for long-form audio without separate speaker embeddings. This approach achieves significant relative DER reduction of 13% and 10% over the conventional 1-pass EEND on Callhome American English and RT03-CTS datasets respectively and marginal improvements over EEND-vector-clustering without the need for additional speaker embeddings. Furthermore, we discuss the computational complexity of our proposed framework and explore strategies for reducing processing times."},
{"title": "Investigating Confidence Estimation Measures for Speaker Diarization", "authors": "Anurag Chowdhury, Abhinav Misra, Mark C.

Such systems can misclassify the speaker of a portion of audio due to a variety of factors, such as speech pattern variation, background noise, and overlapping speech. These errors propagate to, and can adversely affect, downstream systems that rely on the speaker's identity, such as speaker-adapted speech recognition. One of the ways to mitigate these errors is to provide segment-level diarization confidence scores to downstream systems. In this work, we investigate multiple methods for generating diarization confidence scores, including those derived from the original diarization system and those derived from an external model. Our experiments across multiple datasets and diarization systems demonstrate that the most competitive confidence score methods can isolate 30% of the diarization errors within segments with the lowest 10% of confidence scores."},

We also introduce a new metric, T-index, which leverages machine translation systems to capture properties of code-switched words in relation to the participating language pair. Through analysis of diverse Hindi-English and Mandarin-English datasets, we systematically explore how well these metrics align with linguistic intuition regarding code-switching richness levels in conversational versus technical domains."},

Unlike 1D and 2D models limited to radial symmetry, our lightweight 2.5D finite-difference time-domain solver handles irregular geometries bound only to mid-sagittal symmetry. We validated our model against state-of-the-art 2D and 3D solvers for three different vocal tract geometries, each having a unique cross-sectional shape. Results show that the frequency response of 2.5D simulations closely aligns with 3D up to 12 kHz with a Pearson correlation coefficient greater than 0.8 for all geometries. The proposed model also produces effects of higher-order modes associated with non-cylindrical vocal tracts, surpassing the limitations of the advanced 1D and 2D solvers. Moreover, it achieved a speed-up factor close to an order of magnitude compared to the 2D and 3D models."},

The success of receptive multilingualism can be tested by examining accuracy and reaction time of auditory word recognition (AWR) of target words in lexical decision tasks. AWR in such tasks can be affected by adverse listening conditions due to environmental noises and by the presence of a preceding prime word. This study explores whether AWR of L1 in Lx-L1 pairs (Lx = Dutch; L1 = German or English) will be affected by different degrees of similarities in their phonology and semantics and whether such an influence will differ as a function of listening condition. We observed less accurate and slower responses without semantic similarity but a null effect on accuracy without phonological overlap. The interaction with listening conditions is language-dependent."},

The present study tests how accent strength (constructed as a graded factor obtained through ratings) impacts evaluations of speakers’ personality traits (warmth, competence) in the German-Polish context. Moreover, this study intertwines accentedness with two L2 typical error types: phonological (vowel substitutions) and grammatical (gender agreement errors). Results indicate that L2 accent strength had an unfavorable effect on speakers’ competence but positively influenced warmth. The perceived competence was reduced by both error types (phonological, grammatical), while warmth was decreased solely by grammatical errors. The error effects diminished with increasing L2 accent. Finally, Polish participants were less sensitive towards errors and particularly resistant towards phonological substitutions when rating speakers’ personality."},
